AB  - Industry 5.0 focuses on collaboration between humans and machines, demanding robustness and efficiency and the accuracy of intelligent and innovative components used. The use of sensors and the fusion of data obtained from various sensors/modes increased with the rise of the internet of things. The multimodal sensor fusion provides better accuracies than a single source/mode system. Typically, in multimodal fusion, data from all sources is assumed to be available all the time, aligned, and noiseless. Contrary to this highly unrealistic assumption, data from one or more sources is generally unavailable or noisy in most real-world applications. Hence, there is a need for robust sensor fusion, which is a more realistic scenario and critical for Industry 5.0 implementations. Multimodal co-learning is one such approach to study the robustness of sensor fusion for missing and noisy modalities. In this work, to demonstrate the effectiveness of multimodal co-learning for robustness study, gas detection systems are considered a case study. Such gas detection systems are prevalent and crucial to avoid accidents due to gas leaks in many industries and form a part of the industry 5.0 setup. This work considers the primary dataset of gas sensors data and thermal images for robustness experimentation. The results demonstrate that multi-task fusion is robust to missing and noisy modalities than intermediate fusion. Having an additional low-resolution thermal modality supports co-learning and makes it robust to 20% missing sensor data, 90% missing thermal image data, and Gaussian and Normal noise. The end-to-end system architecture proposed can be easily extended to other multimodal applications in Industry 5.0. This study is a step towards creating standard practices for a multimodal co-learning charter for various industrial applications.

AB  - The paper proposes conceptual model of a digital platform for cyber-physical management of modern enterprises in the upcoming era of Industry 5.0. Unlike Industry 4.0, which focuses on automation of physical processes, Industry 5.0 is oriented on digitization of knowledge and automation of reasoning processes for creating artificial intelligence that is able to manage enterprises. This still emerging era will be characterized by the vision of any business, including industrial production or logistics, as a complex adaptive system built on fundamental principles of self-organization and evolution, as well as interaction of artificial intelligence systems and humans. The paper shows that implementation of such production and logistics management systems will require development of new models and decision-making methods based on knowledge and semantic information processing, integration of computational and communication components, accumulation of big data and its processing for predictive analytics, blockchain technologies for fixing mutual obligations of systems components in the for m of smar t contracts, as well as human-machine and software inter faces. Existing approaches to creation of digital platforms within the digital economy of Industry 4.0 and their limitations are analyzed. The concept of digital ecosystem is developed as an open, distributed, self-organized "system of systems" of smart services capable of coming up with solutions and automatically resolving conflicts through negotiations and concessions. The concept of the digital platform within Industry 5.0 is described, which will be able to support functioning of the digital ecosystem of "smart services" of cyberphysical management of both individual objects and enterprises of humans and robots, and in the future, industries of such enterprises — implemented using self-organizing autonomous agents at all levels.

AB  - Abstract — The development of technology that continues to increase significantly, including the application of robotics that is growing among the public is believed to continue to reduce and reduce the role of existing human resources. This problem is the background of the creation of the industrial revolution 5.0 or better known as society 5.0. Japan first coined the Society 5.0. This concept is really different from the concept of industry 4.0, where the concept of Society 5.0 emphasizes more on the human aspect or its human resources, namely how humans can anticipate global trends due to the emergence of industry 4.0. A teacher has a very crucial function in the world of education because a teacher must be able to provide assistance to students to find solutions that contain innovations from the source of problems faced by students. All of this is expected to create students who can continue to innovate and be more creative in their real lives. There are many ways that can be done to prepare students who are creative, innovative and integrated. The learning process can continue to be more interesting and not monotonous when a teacher tries to maximize his creative ideas. So students can become more active in the learning process. Because the learning process is student-centered based not teacher-centered. In the era of modern technology, the learning process that we develop both in terms of methods, strategies or learning media must be related to modern digital technology because almost all students are more comfortable with something modern than conventional monotone. Keywords — Era Society 5.0, The Role of Teachers, Creative Abstrak — Perkembangan teknologi yang terus meningkat secara significant, termasuk aplikasi robotika yang semakin berkembang dikalangan masyarakat dipercaya bisa terus menurunkan dan mengurangi peran sumber daya manusia yang ada. Permasalahan inilah yang melatarbelakangi terciptanya revolusi industri 5.0 atau yang lebih dikenal dengan society 5.0. Jepang yang pertama kali mencetuskan Society 5.0. Konsep ini jauh berbeda dari konsep industri 4.0, dimana pada konsep Society 5.0 lebih menekankan pada aspek manusianya atau SDM nya yaitu bagaimana manusia tersebut bisa melakukan antisipasi terhadap tren global dari akibat munculnya industry 4.0. Seorang guru memiliki fungsi yang sangat crucial dalam dunia pendidikan karena seorang guru harus bisa memberikan bantuan  kepada peserta didik untuk menemukan solusi yang memuat inovasi-inovasi dari sumber permasalahan yang dihadapi oleh peserta didik. Semua  ini diharapkan dapat menciptakan peserta didik yang bisa terus berinovasi dan semakin kreatif dalam kehidupan nyatanya. Ada banyak cara yang bisa dilakukan guna mempersiapkan peserta didik yang kreatif, inovatif dan berintegrasi. Proses pembelajaran bisa terus menjadi lebih menarik dan tidak monoton ketika seorang guru berusaha memaksimalkan ide-ide kreatifnya. Sehingga siswa bisa menjadi lebih aktif dalam proses pembelajaran. Karena proses pembelajarannya berbasis student-centered bukan teacher-centred. Di era teknologi modern, proses pembelajaran yang kita kembangkan baik mengenai metode, strategi ataupun media pembelajaran  harus berhubungan dengan teknologi modern yang serba digital karena hampir semua peserta didik lebih senang dengan sesuatu yang modern dari pada yang konvensional yang bersifat monoton.

AB  - The issue of equipment lifecycle management is considered—implementation of the program of maintenance and repair, capital replacement of equipment. During the life cycle of electrical grid equipment, it is possible to identify a period in which the total cost of repairing the equipment in the future will exceed its capital replacement with new equipment with similar indicators. The materials of domestic and foreign authors were studied on the topic of the operation of the power grid equipment park, regulatory and reference information for distribution power grid companies. Calculated functions are derived based on the economic indicators of the equipment - the cost of repairs, the book value, the level of inflation, taking into account the operation of the equipment. According to the task, a decision-making agent was developed for managing the life cycle of equipment of power grid companies based on economic indicators. The implementation of this algorithm in the production asset management system of interregional distribution grid companies will optimize the life cycle costs of a piece of equipment. The calculations made based on the decision-making algorithm in managing the life cycle of the equipment of power grid companies based on economic indicators indicate a decrease in the total cost of equipment by up to 10%. Investing the freed-up capital will allow the existing high-quality characteristics of the power grid equipment fleet.KeywordsStatus indexGrid equipmentMaintenanceRepairReplacement functionLife cycle

AB  - Three masters of suspicion, i.e. Marx, Freud and Nietzsche, each spoke of a critical task in the realm of human action. Marx suspected that economic motives were often not to support life but instead to suppress it. Nietzsche suspected that religion only produced decadent and timid humans so they never became their true selves, hypocrites and like to scare others. Freud was suspicious of human subconscious motivation so that it must be seriously criticized in order to an action was truly born of compassionate political and social morality. These three masters present important pedagogic values ​​to be developed today, namely education for social change, education for empowerment and education to build a compassionate social and political morality.

AB  - Worldwide, manufacturers are reimagining the future of their workforce and its connection to technology. Rather than replacing humans, Industry 5.0 explores how humans and robots can best complement one another's unique strengths. However, realizing this vision requires an in-depth understanding of how workers view the positive and negative attributes of their jobs, and the place of robots within it. In this paper, we explore the relationship between work attributes and automation goals by engaging in field research at a manufacturing plant. We conducted 50 face-to-face interviews with assembly-line workers $(\mathrm{n}=50)$ , which we analyzed using discourse analysis and social constructivist methods. We found that the work attributes deemed most positive by participants include social interaction, movement and exercise, (human) autonomy, problem solving, task variety, and building with their hands. The main negative work attributes included health and safety issues, feeling rushed, and repetitive work. We identified several ways robots could help reduce negative work attributes and enhance positive ones, such as reducing work interruptions and cultivating physical and psychological well-being. Based on our findings, we created a set of integration considerations for organizations planning to deploy robotics technology, and discuss how the manufacturing and HRI communities can explore these ideas in the future.

AB  - We are still in the midst of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), with more manufacturing lines being labeled as smart thanks to the integration of advanced ICT in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). While I4.0 aims to provision cognitive CPS systems, the nascent Industry 5.0 (I5.0) era goes a step beyond, aiming to build cross-border, sustainable, and circular value chains benefiting society as a whole. An enabler of this vision is the integration of data and AI in the industrial decision-making process, which does not exhibit yet a coordination between the Operation and Information Technology domains (OT/IT). This work proposes an architectural approach and an accompanying software prototype addressing the OT/IT convergence problem. The approach is based on a two-layered middleware solution, where each layer aims to better serve the specific differentiated requirements of the OT and IT layers. The proposal is validated in a real testbed, employing actual machine data, showing the capacity of the components to gracefully scale and serve increasing data volumes.

AB  - The industrial revolution has changed the socio-economic civilisation of mankind. It started dating back in the late 1700s and has been in continuous evolution since then. Presently, we are experiencing the latest industrial revolution, known as Industry 4.0. Among others, ubiquitous technologies probably have been the most influential in the implementation of Industry 4.0. This has led to a new manufacturing paradigm known as ubiquitous manufacturing. This chapter presents an in-depth discussion on different aspects of ubiquitous manufacturing. In addition to the history of industrial revolutions and the fundamentals of ubiquitous manufacturing, the topics such as production planning and scheduling, automated material handling system, and dynamic manufacturing are meticulously discussed from the perspective of the real-life scenarios, in the age of ubiquitous manufacturing. The ubiquitous technologies that have enabled ubiquitous manufacturing are reviewed in detail. Several other related and advanced manufacturing technologies such as cloud manufacturing, cloud robotics, global manufacturing, lean manufacturing, agile manufacturing, additive manufacturing, chaordic manufacturing, etc. are duly accentuated. A futuristic view on Industry 5.0 is also presented.

AB  - One of the biggest challenges facing the factory of the future today is to reduce the time-to-market access and increase through the improvement of competitiveness and efficiency. In order to achieve this target, data analytics in Industrial Cyber-Physical System becomes a feasible option. In this paper, a visual analytics framework for condition monitoring of the machine tool is presented with the aim to manage events and alarms at factory level. The framework is assessed in a particular use case that consists in a multi-threaded cloud-based solution for the global analysis of the behaviour of variables acquired from PLC, CNC and robot manipulator. A human-machine interface is also designed for the real-time visualization of the key performance indicators according to the user’s criteria. This tool implemented is a great solution for condition monitoring and decision-making process based on data analytics from simple statistics to complex machine learning methods. The results achieved are part of the vision and implementation of the industrial test bed of “Industry and Society 5.0” platform.

AB  - This study aims to provide a description of ecoliteracy as an effort to build green behavior in early childhood. In the era of the industrial revolution 4.0 and society 5.0, the paradigm of developing issues is related to global issues, one of which is the issue of the earth issue, in which there is a study on the importance of humans to protect and maintain ecosystem balance. The introduction of green behavior through ecoliteracy is very important for children through the role of adults. Children must have an awareness of loving the environment so that when the child has the awareness to love the environment, the child will happily show behavior to protect the universe. Study Methods This is a literature review of various sources related to ecoliteracy that are relevant to embedding green behavior in early childhood. There are several interesting ways to introduce green behavior through ecoliteracy in early childhood which are obtained from the results of the study of relevant studies, among others, by using storytelling methods, conducting field trips or field trips, and carrying out project activities to preserve the surrounding environment.

AB  - Female genital mutilation (FGM) or female circumcision is a traditional practice among various tribes in Africa including Nigeria. Under this paper I have highlighted the pros and cons in favour and those oppose to the practice. The practitioners argued for its continuation because it was an important cultural heritage that marks the transition of a girl from childhood to adulthood while the abolitionists wanted it to be abolished because it violates human rights. I have adopted a doctrinal method of research under this paper to look into the veracity of the arguments of both sides. The prevailing opinion is that FGM or female circumcision violated both constitutionally guaranteed rights like rights to life, health, physical integrity, dignity, etc and human rights treaties and Conventions like United Nations Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Covenant on Civil and Political rights, the Maputo Protocol, etc. in view of this the practice should be abolished.      Keywords: Female, Genital, Mutilation, Circumcision, Cutting, Women’s Right.

AB  - Worldwide, manufacturers are reimagining the future of their workforce and its connection to technology. Rather than replacing humans, Industry 5.0 explores how humans and robots can best complement one another's unique strengths. However, realizing this vision requires an in-depth understanding of how workers view the positive and negative attributes of their jobs, and the place of robots within it. In this paper, we explore the relationship between work attributes and automation goals by engaging in field research at a manufacturing plant. We conducted 50 face-to-face interviews with assembly-line workers $(\mathrm{n}=50)$ , which we analyzed using discourse analysis and social constructivist methods. We found that the work attributes deemed most positive by participants include social interaction, movement and exercise, (human) autonomy, problem solving, task variety, and building with their hands. The main negative work attributes included health and safety issues, feeling rushed, and repetitive work. We identified several ways robots could help reduce negative work attributes and enhance positive ones, such as reducing work interruptions and cultivating physical and psychological well-being. Based on our findings, we created a set of integration considerations for organizations planning to deploy robotics technology, and discuss how the manufacturing and HRI communities can explore these ideas in the future.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is 1) to investigate the effects on the crucial Industry 4.0 technological innovations that interact between the real and virtual worlds and that are applied in the sustainable supply chain process; 2) to contribute to the identification of the opportunities, the challenges and the gaps that will support the new research study developments and 3) to analyze the impact of the Industry 4.0 technologies as facilitators of the sustainable supply chain performance in the midst of the Coronavirus (COVID-19).,This research is performed through a bibliographic review in the electronic databases of the Emerald Insight, the Scopus and the Web of Science, considering the main scientific publications on the subject.,The bibliographic search results in 526 articles, followed by two sequential filters for deleting the duplicate articles (resulting in 487 articles) and for selecting the most relevant articles (resulting in 150 articles).,This article identifies the opportunities and the challenges focused on the emerging Industry 4.0 theme. The opportunities can contribute to the sustainable performance of the supply chains and their territories. The Industry 4.0 can also generate challenges like the social inequalities related to the position of the man in the labor market by replacing the human workforce with the machines. Therefore, the man-machine relationship in the Industry 4.0 era is analyzed as a gap in the literature. Therefore, as a way to fill this gap, the authors of this article suggest the exploration of the research focused on the Society 5.0. Also known as “super-smart society,” this recent theme appeared in Japan in April 2016. According to Fukuda (2020), in addition to the focus on the technological development, the Society 5.0 also aims at the quality of life and the social challenge resolutions.,This article contributes to the analysis of the Industry 4.0 technologies as facilitators in the sustainable supply chain performance. It addresses the impacts of the Industry 4.0 technologies applied to the supply chains in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it analyzes the research gaps and limitations found in the literature. The result of this study can add value and stimulate new research studies related to the application of the Industry 4.0 technologies as facilitators in the supply chain sustainable performance. It can encourage the studies related to the COVID-19 impacts on the sustainable supply chains, and it can promote the research development on the relationship among the man, the machine and the labor in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

AB  - This article discusses the spiritual formation and God's Word in reformation. The formulation of the problem is the relationship between spiritual formation and God's Word in reformation. The author uses literature studies to collect information about spiritual formation and God's Word in reformation. Spirit for sola scriptura has produced a change in the life of the church at that moment. All teachings, church traditions, and practical actions which is conducted by church member must be tested under the Word of God. In the present context, the church who facing various challenges related to a moral life, teaching, and practical actions must return to the principles of the word of God. To build a spiritual life, we must start from the Bible that is interpreted correctly, which then becomes a theological development, which then influences the concept of believer's thinking and practical actions. Abstrak Artikel ini membahas tentang formasi rohani dan Firman Tuhan dalam reformasi. Rumusan masalah penelitian ini adalah bagaimana kaitan antara formasi rohani dan firman Tuhan dalam reformasi? Penulis menggunakan studi pustaka untuk menggali informasi tentang formasi rohani dan Firman Tuhan dalam reformasi. Semangat untuk sola scriptura menghasilkan perubahan dalam kehidupan gereja pada masa itu. Segala pengajaran, tradisi gereja, dan tindakan praktis yang dilakukan oleh setiap anggota gereja harus diuji di bawah Firman Tuhan. Dalam konteks masa kini, menghadapi berbagai tantangan gereja baik yang terkait dengan kehidupan moral maupun pengajaran dan tindakan praktis, gereja harus kembali pada prinsip Firman Tuhan. Untuk membangun kehidupan rohani maka harus dimulai dari Alkitab yang ditafsirkan secara benar yang kemudian menjadi sebuah bangunan teologi yang kemudian mempengaruhi konsep berpikir orang percaya dan tindakan praktis.

AB  - <jats:p>The Arabic dictionary is the primary reference for students learning Arabic, mainly when translating. With advances in technology, dictionaries are no longer in sheets of paper but in digital form that mobile phones and desktops can be accessed. This study aimed to determine students' perceptions of the use of digital dictionaries and various aspects of the difficulties experienced by students. This exploratory research was conducted using a survey technique on randomly selected students, and a descriptive technique was used as an analytical tool. The number of respondents is as many as 100 students from 2 different universities. In general, answers related to students' perceptions can be mapped in several ways: 1) students’ ability to translate is still low. 2) students still have many difficulties when translating and how to use a dictionary. 3) dictionaries are still required, both digital and print. 4) google translate became the student's favorite dictionary. So, the author recommends special training in dictionaries at the beginning of lectures at the higher education level.</jats:p>

AB  - Application of Information Technology (IT) in the domain of Human Resource Management (HRM) systems is a sine qua non for any organization for successfully adopting and implementing Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). However, these systems are required to ensure non-biased, efficient, transparent and secure environment. Blockchain, a technology based on distributed digital ledgers, can help facilitate the process of successfully effectuating these specifications. A detailed literature review has been conducted to identify the current status of usage of Information Technology in the domain of Human Resource Management and how Blockchain can help achieve a smart, cost-effective, efficient, transparent and secure factory management system. A Blockchain based Recruitment Management System (BcRMS) as well as Blockchain based Human Resource Management System (BcHRMS) algorithm have been proposed. From the analysis of the results obtained through the case study, it is evident that the proposed system holds definite advantages compared to the existing recruitment systems. Future research directions have also been identified and advocated.

AB  - <jats:p>Risk management is one of the topical areas in construction project management research. However, no attempt has been made in the past decades to explore the emerging themes in this area. This paper reviews the research trends in risk management in construction. The bibliometric data of 1635 publications between 1979 and 2022 were extracted from Scopus using a set of keywords. The study used VOSviewer and Gephi to conduct a scientometric analysis on the extracted publications. The review outcome indicates a significant increase in publications on risk management in construction, with about 205 publications recorded between 2021 and 2022 alone. Based on this analysis, it is projected that the next decade will see significant research on risk management, especially as the construction industry moves towards Industry 5.0 with many uncertainties. Further, the most productive countries of risk management studies in construction include China, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Hong Kong. Emerging key research areas are discussed using network diagrams and clusters. These areas include the processes in risk management, risk analytical models and techniques, sources of risk and uncertainties, effective knowledge-based systems for improved risk management, risk contingency in construction contracts, risk-integrated project planning and scheduling, and stakeholder management. The findings of this study inform researchers on the current progress of risk management studies in construction and highlight possible research directions that can be considered.</jats:p>

AB  - The widespread digitization and dynamic development of the technologies of the fourth industrial revolution, leading to the dehumanization of industry, have increased the interest of the scientific community in aspects of industrial humanization, sustainability and resilience. Hence, the aim of the article is to identify areas related to humanization and sustainability of the concept of Industry 4.0. A bibliometric analysis of Web of Science using Vosviewer tools, Excell and content analysis of selected papers were applied. The most important results include the determination of the dynamics of the increase in the number of publications in the segment of Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0. The article indicates the weaknesses of the concept of Industry 4.0, especially in the area of the role of man in smart factories and sustainable development. Thus, the framework of the concept of Industry 5.0 was identified. In addition, the bibliometric analysis carried out allowed the identification of an important stream of employee skill development.

AB  - Nowadays, with the increasing world population, the production and consumption of disposable products is very high. Thus, causing waste that fills the land and sea. Not only waste from humans, but the Indonesian sea also produces marine biota waste that is usually stranded on the coasts. Waste of marine life on Santolo Beach, Garut, produces a negative impact on public health and causes environmental disturbance if left around the beach as only a part of it is decomposed in the soil and the rest remains as waste. The purpose of this paper is to design jewelry that also has a traceable supply chain, and can also contribute to the welfare of the environment and local community of Sagaranten, Sukabumi. This can be interpreted as halal jewellery. The author interprets and reinterprets the ethical halal to be applied to jewelry to be Halal in the context of Sustainable Product Design (SPD). This SPD will demonstrate the meaning of halal jewelry by processing, environmentally friendly materials as well as various other considerations in the social and economic fields to achieve sustainable profit-making products.

AB  - The transition from a linear economy towards a bioeconomy setting emphasizes on the need for diversification in the current technologies that can accommodate elements of bioeconomy to utilize biological resources sustainably. In this chapter, the applications of supercritical fluid technology and algal biomass technology are highlighted. Supercritical fluid technology is a carbon-neutral technology that is highly unique and versatile which supports the notions of biomanufacturing in the bioeconomy concept. Besides replacing conventional extraction methods, supercritical fluids can be applied towards enzymatic pretreatment and activation, biological membrane synthesis and bioalcohol recovery due to its non-reactive, non-flammable and clean separation properties. On the other hand, the potential of algal biomass technology in bioenergy production such as bio-lipids and biohydrogen can be exploited due to the intrinsic properties of microalgae that acts as a backbone in the bioremediation of gaseous greenhouse gases. Furthermore, microalgae technology can be integrated into existing traditional refineries to act similar to a separator that captures unwanted emissions and converts them into value-added products.

AB  - The society increasingly based on digital culture is already an unavoidable reality. This paper aims to contribute, in a preliminary way, to understand several of the implications in Sociology that this propagation of digital culture involves through a bibliographical review. We analyse several implications in dimensions such as the very purpose of Sociology (highlighting digital literacy and the level of democracy) and social research (addressing issues raised by the big date, the interdisciplinary dialogue between Sociology and other scientific areas, and new ethical dilemmas). We conclude that there are profound implications both in the research object and in the research processes of Sociology, which we will develop in later phases of the dissemination of this research. As a major implication, the reflective capacity of sociological knowledge is central to the preparation for this new reality, but, at the same time, also to a well-founded critical understanding of digital society.

AB  - This paper proposes a concept of Digital Stereotypes, observed during research on quantitative overrepresentation of one class over others, and its impact on the results of the training of Deep Learning models. The real-life observed data classes are rarely of the same size, and the intuition of presenting multiple examples of one class and then showing a few counterexamples may be very misleading in multimodal classification. Deep Learning models, when taught with overrepresentation, may produce incorrect inferring results, similar to stereotypes. The generic idea of stereotypes seems to be helpful for categorisation from the training point of view, but it has a negative influence on the inferring result. Authors evaluate a large dataset in various scenarios: overrepresentation of one or two classes, underrepresentation of some classes, and same-size (trimmed) classes. The presented research can be applied to any multiclassification applications, but it may be especially important in AI, where the classification, uncertainty and building new knowledge overlap. This paper presents specific 'decreases in accuracy' observed within multiclassification of unleveled datasets. The 'decreases in accuracy', named by the authors 'stereotypes', can also bring an inspiring insight into other fields and applications, not only multimodal sentiment analysis.

AB  - As a zoon politicon creature, humans always develop and follow the pattern of life and life accompanied by various innovations in the form of science and information technology. Advances in information technology in particular have changed the face of human life as zoon politicon in various sectors such as the economic and the education. One important phase in technological development is the emergence of the 4th wave of industrial revolution, or better known as industrial revolution 4.0. The 4.0 industrial revolution is one of Germany's modern technological strategies in 2020 (Germany’s High-Tech Strategy 2020). The strategy is implemented through improving manufacturing sector technology, creating a consistent strategic policy framework, and setting certain priorities in the face of global competition. Industry 4.0 is not yet over and suddenly society 5.0 appears. Society 5.0 was first echoed by the Japanese State, where Society 5.0 was the answer to the challenges that arose due to the era of the industrial revolution 4.0. This development provides unrest for writers related to the readiness of zoon politicon to deal with every phase of life development like this. The study related to human readiness in facing industrial revolution 5.0 will be comprehensively discussed in this article.

AB  - <jats:p>Smart machine companions such as artificial intelligence (AI) assistants and collaborative robots are rapidly populating the factory floor. Future factory floor workers will work in teams that include both human co-workers and smart machine actors. The visions of Industry 5.0 describe sustainable, resilient, and human-centered future factories that will require smart and resilient capabilities both from next-generation manufacturing systems and human operators. What kinds of approaches can help design these kinds of resilient human–machine teams and collaborations within them? In this paper, we analyze this design challenge, and we propose basing the design on the joint cognitive systems approach. The established joint cognitive systems approach can be complemented with approaches that support human centricity in the early phases of design, as well as in the development of continuously co-evolving human–machine teams. We propose approaches to observing and analyzing the collaboration in human–machine teams, developing the concept of operations with relevant stakeholders, and including ethical aspects in the design and development. We base our work on the joint cognitive systems approach and propose complementary approaches and methods, namely: actor–network theory, the concept of operations and ethically aware design. We identify their possibilities and challenges in designing and developing smooth human–machine teams for Industry 5.0 manufacturing systems.</jats:p>

AB  - Physical Internet (PI) is an open global logistics system of which components are hyperconnected for increased efficiency and sustainability. Digital twin (DT), referring to the virtual representation of a physical object, is well-perceived as a key driver in the development of PI-based Supply Chain Management (SCM). Due to the capabilities of real-time monitoring and evaluation of large-scale complex systems, significant research efforts have been made to exploit values of PI/DT in SCM. Despite this, the current literature remained largely unstructured and scattered due to a lack of systematic literature reviews to synergise research findings, analyse the evolution of research fronts and extract emerging trends in the field. To address this issue, the paper deploys a bibliometric knowledge mapping approach to provide a bird's eye view of the current research status in the PI/DT-SCM area. Using CiteSpace's keyword co-occurrence network, 518 journal articles are clustered into 10 key research streams on PI/DT applications in: job shop scheduling, smart manufacturing design, PI-based SCM, manufacturing virtualisation, information management, sustainability development, data analytics, manufacturing operations management, simulation and optimisation, and assembly process planning. Based on citation burst rate, keywords representing research frontiers of the PI/DT are detected and their temporal evolutions are discussed. Likewise, some identified emerging research trends are production process and system, robotics, computer architecture, and cost. Finally, seven future research directions are suggested, which emphasise on several PI/DT-related issues, including business ecosystem, sustainability development, SC downstream management, cognitive thinking in Industry 5.0, citizen twin in digital society, and SC resilience.

AB  - This paper presents the development of an open-source, low-sized, BGA microcontroller breakout board, that can be used for the development of wearable and cyber-physical prototypes. The board is based on the low power, 8-bit, ATtiny20-CCU Microchip AVR microcontroller. The ATtiny20-CCU can be programmed without bootloader, using the Atmel Tiny Programming Interface (TPI), instead of In-System Programming (ISP). The C code used to program the microcontroller can be written and compiled using the Microchip Studio freeware platform. The ATtiny20-CCU Ultra Fine-pitch Ball Grid Array (UFBGA) packaging technology allows the shrinkage of the conceived Electroless Nickel-Immersion Gold (ENIG) Printed Circuit Board (PCB) to a size of only 15<i>.</i>5 × 13 mm. Its low cost also makes it a viable option for developing many educational electronic projects, especially for Instrumentation and Assistive Technology. The contribution of this paper is mainly the hardware prototype design, the PCB manufacturing, building and test of a very low-sized open source <i>µ</i>-breakout PCB board, for wearable Instrumentation applications, towards the emergent Society/Industry 5.0.

The perspective empowers the creation of a new biosphere based on technological progress, but in the sustainable solid waste management field, it is difficult to encounter and shape the systematized processes due to barriers and challenges. To address this shortcoming, this study evaluates the technical challenges faced in the field of sustainable solid waste management toward society 5.0. The valid attributes are usually described the qualitative information. The fuzzy Delphi method is applied to acquire the valid and reliable attributes. Fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory experiment is to visualize the causal interrelationships among the attributes. Choquet integral with respect to the nonadditive attributes over the valid set provides an overall perspective function. The results establish an understanding of sustainable solid waste management barriers in the perspectives under uncertainties. Community uncertainty, policy and regulation problems, city architecture, and technology interaction are the factors that influence sustainable performance. In practices, (1) diverse disciplines and sectors in local, national, and global communities; (2) a lack of mobility and reliability; (3) mass production and mass consumption; (4) an insufficient level of artificial intelligence application; and (5) failures related to data management and security hinder the improvement of sustainable solid waste management toward society 5.0. The social and technical perspectives are indicated as the top priorities to improve SSWM performance.

AB  - After the visions of Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0 were presented, a proliferation of artificial intelligence technologies have been applied to the financial field because AI develops fast, especially intelligent analysis methods for alternative financial data. However, the organic integration of the financial industry and the Internet of Things lacks relevant standards, and there is no appropriate work summary to coordinate the formulation of these standards. This work aims to effectively improve the reliability of information acquisition and the accuracy of data processing in the financial industry. In addition, this work also investigates papers and standards related to financial intelligence technology in recent years and statistically analyzes the evaluation indicators of AI research papers. Then, a standard evaluation framework is proposed for financial intelligence technology, which is evaluated for performance verification. The comparative experiments demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of the financial intelligence standard model reaches 95.44%, and the prediction error is substantially smaller than that of the other model algorithms. The financial intelligence standard model can make accurate predictions on alternative financial data and has high reliability and validity. The model can provide an experimental reference for intellectual development in the financial field and enable participants to improve work efficiency and standards throughout the process of developing intelligent financial technology.

AB  - Mathematization of research is one of the most effective methods of virtual substantiation of foodstuff recipe and technology. This approach allows creating a product that meets consumer's individual needs, i.e. personalized foodstuff (ethnicity, cultural preferences, regional and environmental characteristics, lifestyle), and at the same time reducing the time and cost of decision-making. The article discusses the hypothesis that the “digital twin” of a food product is a virtual model of the product, namely its mathematical model (simulation model). A simulation model is a logical and mathematical description of a food product that is used to conduct a computerized experiment in order to design desired characteristics and properties. The “digital twin” combines all variety of factors from chemical composition, functional and technological properties to organoleptic indicators. The application of the “digital twin” model of the foodstuff will allow: (1) reacting quickly to changes in the composition, properties and types of raw ingredients, (2) adjusting the product recipe in response to changes in consumer preferences, (3) designing products with a given chemical composition, nutritional value and functional orientation, (4) creating functional, specialized products taking into account the metabolism of nutrients (ethnicity, cultural preferences, health status and clinical factors). Products adapted to the needs of small categories of people will help reducing the risks for those who already have diseases, and will meet the needs of those who would like to make their diet more appropriate to individual needs. The proposed approach to creating a model of the “digital twin” of the foodstuff includes several stages. The first stage involves optimization of the nutritional and biological value of the designed product. The second stage is related to designing the food product’s structural forms. But even if the recipe of a food product is optimally selected in the first stage, it does not guarantee its transformation during processing into a stable system with the required structural, mechanical, functional and technological parameters. Evaluation of the developed food product’s efficiency is possible only by analysing numerous and various parameters and indicators. It is convenient to generalize (convolute) many parameters and indicators into a single quantitative dimensionless indicator. To assess the quality and adequacy of the food product, it is suggested to use an integral indicator in the form of additive convolution – the ‘functional’ of the food product quality.

AB  - <jats:p>The paper analysis the strategies and concepts developed in the world in modern directions: innova- tive economy, digital economy, artificial intelligence, Industry 4.0 and others. The problem is to determine the initial fundamental parameters of order and their prospects in the global world, the definition and principles of artificial intel- ligence systems (AIS), its structure and important aspects and principles of future science and technology in analysis and synthesis based on synergetic approaches, innovative, information, converged technologies, taking into account the design of future and viable and safe and sustainable development in the context of Industry 4.0, digital economy (DE) and Society 5.0. The general scheme of the integrated model of sustainable and socio-humanitarian development in the global system is proposed, which the authors call the noosphere model of sustainable and safe development as an important fundamental platform for the design and creation of AIS. In the XXI century education, science and innova- tive technologies becomes the «basis» of the spiritual and material reproduction of man, transforming the society of the XXI century into an educational society, ensures compliance with the law of advanced development of human quality, quality of social intelligence and quality of educational systems in society. noosphere evolution (Субетто, 2008). Industry 4.0 is the next stage in the digitalization of production technologies with the accelerated introduction of new developments and cyberphysical systems, which is changing business models. Accordingly, Industry 4.0 as a separate segment of digital manufacturing technologies takes its place among other digital sectors. The analysis of the Strategies and Concepts developed in the world in modern directions: innovative economy, digital economy, artificial intelli- gence, Industry 4.0 and others is carried out in the work. The problem is to determine the initial fundamental para- meters of order and their prospects in the global world, the definition and principles of artificial intelligence systems (AIS), its structure and important aspects and principles of future science and technology in analysis and synthesis ba- sed on synergetic approaches, innovative, information, converged technologies, taking into account the design of future and viable and safe and sustainable development in the context of Industry 4.0, DE and Society 5.0. The main scientific and technological factors in the 21st century will be the development of: Artificial Intelligence, Nano Technologies, Bio-Media Technologies, Cognitive Technologies and Socio-Humanitarian Technologies. More specifically – this is the modern development of Innovative Technologies: «NBIC SH». Therefore, it is necessary to note the importance of taking into account the principle of I2K2+SH, ie: Intellectualization, Integration, Convergence, Coevolution and Socio- humanitarian technologies. It is important and necessary to take into account modern principles of designing a su- stainable and secure AIS and solving the problem of Harmonization between 2 worlds: Real and Virtual, especially in their hybridization. Our immediate future is a hybrid nonlinear world. Note that digitalization, artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics will be the main drivers of global economic growth by 2030E. An important paradigm and platform is the Integrated System: for Industry 4.0, DE and AI, taking into account the complex principle of I2K2+SH. If the transition of the Ukrainian economy to an innovative one does not take place in the next 3-5 years, Ukraine will remain in the backyard of civilization.</jats:p>

AB  - Purpose




This paper aims to investigate three key factors (i.e. cognitive dimensions, the knowledge-driven approach and absorptive capacity) that are likely to determine the preference for informal inbound open innovation (OI) modes, through the lens of the OI model and knowledge-based view (KBV). The innovation literature has differentiated these collaborations into informal inbound OI entry modes and formal inbound OI modes, offering an advocative and conceptual view. However, empirical studies on these collaborations are still limited.




Design/methodology/approach




Building on the above-mentioned theoretical framework, the empirical research was performed in two stages. First, data were collected via a closed-ended questionnaire distributed to all the participants from the sample by e-mail. Second, to assess the hypotheses, structural equation modelling (SEM) via IBM® SPSS® Amos 20 was applied.




Findings




The empirical research was conducted on 175 small to medium enterprises in the United Kingdom, suggesting that the knowledge-driven approach is the strongest determinant, leading to a preference for informal inbound OI modes. The findings were obtained using SEM and are discussed in line with the theoretical framework.




Research limitations/implications




Owing to the chosen context and sector of the empirical analysis, the research results may lack generalisability. Hence, new studies are proposed.




Practical implications




The paper includes implications for the development of informal inbound OI led by knowledge-driven approach.




Originality/value




This paper offers an empirical research to investigate knowledge-driven preferences in informal inbound OI modes.

AB  - We introduced a decision-making model based on value functions that included individualistic utility function and socio-constructivistic norm function and proposed a norm-fostering process that recursively updates norm function through mutual recognition between the self and others. As an example, we looked at the resource-sharing problem typical of economic activities and assumed the distribution of individual actions to define the (1) norm function fostered through mutual comparison of value/action ratio based on the equity theory (progressive tax-like), (2) norm function proportional to resource utilization (proportional tax-like) and (3) fixed norm function independent of resource utilization (fixed tax-like). By carrying out numerical simulation, we showed that the progressive tax-like norm function (i) does not increase disparity for the distribution of the actions, unlike the other norm functions, and (ii) has high resource productivity and low Gini coefficient. Therefore the progressive tax-like norm function has the highest sustainability and fairness.

AB  - Emerging energy systems are inherently different from their conventional counter-parts. To address all issues of these systems, comprehensive approaches of transdisciplinary and post-normal sciences are needed. This article tries to re-conceptualize emerging energy systems using Robert Rosen’s theory of anticipatory system and introduces the concept of the anticipatory smart energy system (ASES). Three important features of an ASES are described and socio-technical considerations for realization of these features are discussed. The article also considers realization of such systems under society 5.0 paradigm and spime techno-culture. In ASESs, the identity of users evolves and new identities are created for energy users, based on the production, consumption, storage, and distributed management of energy. An Anticipatory energy system can manage a common pool of prosumaging.

AB  - Abstract Emerging technologies such as cloud computing, augmented and virtual reality, artificial intelligence and robotics, among others, are transforming the field of manufacturing and industry as a whole in unprecedent ways. This fourth industrial revolution is consequentially changing how operators that have been crucial to industry success go about their practices in industrial environments. This paper briefly introduces a novel way of conceptualizing the human operator necessarily implicates human values in the technologies that constitute it. Similarly, the design methodology known as value sensitive design (VSD) is drawn upon to discuss how these Operator 4.0 technologies can be designed for human values.

AB  - With the upcoming fifth Industrial Revolution, humans and collaborative robots will dance together in production. They themselves act as an agent in a connected world, understood as a multi-agent system, in which the Laplacian spectrum plays an important role since it can define the connection of the complex networks as well as depict the robustness. In addition, the Laplacian spectrum can locally check the controllability and observability of a dynamic controlled network, etc. This paper presents a new method, which is based on the Augmented Lagrange based Alternating Direction Inexact Newton (ALADIN) method, to faster the convergence rate of the Laplacian Spectrum Estimation via factorization of the average consensus matrices, that are expressed as Laplacian-based matrices problems. Herein, the non-zero distinct Laplacian eigenvalues are the inverse of the stepsizes {αt,t=1,2,…} of those matrices. Therefore, the problem now is to carry out the agreement on the stepsize values for all agents in the given network while ensuring the factorization of average consensus matrices to be accomplished. Furthermore, in order to obtain the entire Laplacian spectrum, it is necessary to estimate the relevant multiplicities of these distinct eigenvalues. Consequently, a non-convex optimization problem is formed and solved using ALADIN method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated through the simulation results and the comparison with the Lagrange-based method in advance.

AB  - <jats:p>Alarm management is an important task to ensure the safety of industrial process technologies. A well-designed alarm system can reduce the workload of operators parallel with the support of the production, which is in line with the approach of Industry 5.0. Using Process Mining tools to explore the operator-related event scenarios requires a goal-oriented log file format that contains the start and the end of the alarms along with the triggered operator actions. The key contribution of the work is that a method is presented that transforms the historical event data of control systems into goal-oriented log files used as inputs of process mining algorithms. The applicability of the proposed process mining-based method is presented concerning the analysis of a hydrofluoric acid alkylation plant. The detailed application examples illustrate how the extracted process models can be interpreted and utilized. The results confirm that applying the tools of process mining in alarm management requires a goal-oriented log-file design.</jats:p>

AB  - Background and purpose: The transformation to Industry 4.0 increases the number of robots installed within indus­tries, which brings great shifts in industrial ecosystems. For this reason, our research goal was to analyze the key performance indicators to investigate the economic and social sustainability of the changes in production. Methodology: The combination of official (World Bank, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) and publicly available (Federal Reserve Economic Data, Industrial Federation of Robotics) data was used for statistical data processing, including comparison, correlation, cross-correlation and vector autoregression analysis, to present the past develop­ments and also to predict future trends within the U.S. manufacturing sector. Results: In contrast to robust industry robotization observed in the 2008–2018 period, the share of manufacturing output and employment declined. Nonetheless, the vector autoregression model forecast shows, that the U.S. manu­facturing sector has arrived at a turning point, after which robotization can increase employment and labor productivi­ty of workers, while also stimulating further growth of their education levels. Conclusion: The transition to Industry 4.0 has a major impact on increasing demands for new knowledge and skills for increased productivity. Accordingly, forecasted growths of analyzed manufacturing indicators suggest that negative impacts of robotization in the recent past were only temporary, due to the entrance to the Industry 4.0 era. Nonetheless, additional policies to support sustainable industry development are required.

The “Industrie 4.0” initiative declared by Germany in 2011 was soon followed by the „Advanced Manufactured Partnership” program of the U.S., as well as by the “Made in China 2025” initiative for the advancement of the productive sector launched by the People’s Republic of China and the “Industria 2016” vision of Italy. The “Society 5.0” strategy of Japan announced in 2018 symbolizes both the destructing and the constructive power of the fourth industrial revolution which will result in a complete restructuring of all fields of economy and society. The evolution of Industry 4.0 is parallel to the conscious efforts of many European governments to develop their own start-up ecosystems. These start-ups face significant challenges, but at the same time, they are the means to support changes. Technology-oriented start-up companies (also referred as early stage start-ups in Hungary) are not only expected to prove their own reason for existence, but should also support the complex changes of the corporate sector. This paper is based on a survey among early stage start-up companies, having received angel investment from technology incubators. The survey has focused on how these start-ups see of the significance of Industry 4.0, what differences are evident compared to traditional companies, and what management competencies are thought to be required to realize their growth strategy.

AB  - This paper provides preliminary discourse on buzz words about Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0. This discourse focuses on the lens of Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and Machine Learning of Artificial Intelligence (MLAI). To some extent several companies have embarked Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0 within Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Through the wave of IoT Technology, Industries are adopting automated machinery. Predictive maintenance (PM) is indispensable not only toward the machines" vitality and longevity purpose, but also toward the human error reduction. This paper elaborates its discourse of Industry 4.0 and Society through the lens of CBM and MLAI. The mentioned Machine Learning, in this paper, refers to research methodology, as methodological frameworks. Those frameworks comprise several phases, which are: 1. Equipment Analysis; 2. Data Evaluation; 3. Data Selection and Process; 4. Modeling; 5. Decision Support Model Evaluation. The MLAI techniques are based upon the identification of behaviour patterns. This identification comprises datasets that exclude mathematical models or prior historical knowledge. The discourse in this paper intertwines CBM process and MLAI through data cleaning and processing, features stratification and extraction, model stratification and validation. This paper elaborates two renowned maintenance approaches which are preventive and corrective maintenance. Discourse in this paper focuses on corrective action, known as predictive maintenance (PM), or condition based maintenance (CBM) within Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM). CBM is chosen as the most desirable strategy, as it involves the intervention as the consequence of the machine breakdown. It also provides cost savings toward spare parts consumption, and optimizes production.

AB  - Staying at the top is getting tougher and more challenging due to the fast-growing and changing digital technologies and AI-based solutions. The world of technology, mass customization, and advanced manufacturing is experiencing a rapid transformation. Robots are becoming even more important as they can now be coupled with the human mind by means of brain–machine interface and advances in artificial intelligence. A strong necessity to increase productivity while not removing human workers from the manufacturing industry is imposing punishing challenges on the global economy. To counter these challenges, this article introduces the concept of Industry 5.0, where robots are intertwined with the human brain and work as collaborator instead of competitor. This article also outlines a number of key features and concerns that every manufacturer may have about Industry 5.0. In addition, it presents several developments achieved by researchers for use in Industry 5.0 applications and environments. Finally, the impact of Industry 5.0 on the manufacturing industry and overall economy is discussed from an economic and productivity point of view, where it is argued that Industry 5.0 will create more jobs than it will take away.

AB  - Digitalization is rushing throughout the world, namely, in industrial and societal infrastructures. Hence, digital transformation becomes a pillar of industrial policy, known in Europe as “Industry 4.0,” in China as “made in China 2025,” in Asia as “Smart Cities,” in Japan as “Society 5.0,” and in North America as “Industrial Internet.” These transformations will change the industrial landscape, toward Quality 4.0 and therefore, our lives. The presented research was conducted on quality management employees in Portugal and it aims to analyze if such employees have the perception of the impact of Industry 4.0 in the quality management profession and the required and needed skills. After analyzing the answered questionnaires, 90 results were considered valid. This is the sample of our study. Simultaneously, the goal of this research is also to review and analyze the main topics in progress related to quality management for the fourth industrial revolution and how quality emerges of this change. The professionals that work on quality management must have creative thinking, be leaders, know how to communicate and work as a team, as well as, to have knowledge and understanding of ICT (Information and Communications Technology), and main pillars of Industry 4.0. These are the main findings. Besides that, they must know how to motivate their work teams, be open to change, know how to use Big Data to make decisions and above all, they must know how to manage conflicts. In addition, quality professionals must promote the design and production of first class products, be the defenders of their customers within the organization, and finally, they must create value for the stakeholders.

AB  - Scholars believe that the newly introduced Industry 5.0 has the potential to move beyond the profit-centered productivity of Industry 4.0 and to promote sustainable development goals such as human-centricity, socio-environmental sustainability, and resilience. However, little has been done to understand how this ill-defined phenomenon may deliver its indented sustainability values despite these speculative promises. To address this knowledge gap, the present study developed a strategy roadmap that explains the mechanism by which Industry 5.0 delivers its intended sustainable development functions. The study first developed and introduced the Industry 5.0 reference model that describes the technical and functional properties of this phenomenon. The study further conducted a content-centric synthesis of the literature and identified the sustainable development functions of Industry 5.0. Next, the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique was employed to identify the sequential relationships among the functions and construct the Industry 5.0-enabled model of sustainable development. The ISM involved collecting the opinions of 11 Industry 5.0 experts through expert panel meetings. Results revealed that Industry 5.0 delivers sustainable development values through 16 functions. Circular intelligent products, employee technical assistance, intelligent automation, open sustainable innovation, renewable integration, and supply chain adaptability are examples of the functions identified. These functions are highly interrelated and should be developed in a specific order so that the synergies and complementarities among them would maximize the sustainable development value gains. The roadmap to Industry 5.0-driven sustainability developed in this study is expected to provide a better understanding of ways Industry 5.0 can contribute to sustainable development, explaining how the development of its functions should be managed to maximize their synergies and contribution to the intended sustainability values. The study also highlights important avenues for future research, emphasizing the potential enablers of Industry 5.0 development, such as Government 5.0 or Corporate Governance 5.0.

AB  - The basic difference between the Industrial revolution 4.0 and society 5.0 is that in the era of the industrial revolution 4.0 technology and computers are used in all human activities, while the era of society 5.0 is an era in which technology becomes a part of humans themselves. The internet is no longer a source of information, but is used to live life. To prepare the young generation to face all the challenges that arise in the era of industrial revolution 4.0 and society 5.0, it is necessary to work hard for educational institutions to educate their students to be ready to face the changing times, and this must start from the most basic level of education, namely at elementary school level (SD and SMP). For this reason, this community service program was arranged, namely improving the quality of education by providing robotic learning training for supervisory teachers and elementary school (SD) students so that they become a generation ready to face all the challenges of the industrial revolution era 4.0 and the society 5.0 era

AB  - Companies that believe in values will be successful in the long run. These core values will give spirit or motivation to everyone in the organization and finally to the community in growing a human-centered monotheistic society 5.0. This article aimed to examine the phases of implementing the Islamic value-based HR Model in companies. The model used was the HR model with Islamic values and the meaning of prayer, as well as a harmonious corporate culture, resulting in the expected HR performance. This study used qualitative research methods with the object of research are two companies that have implemented Islamic values in managing the company. The technique of collecting data was triangulation, namely research instrument,  in-depth interviews and secondary data analysis. Data analysis was inductive. The application of the Islamic value-based HR model goes through two phases, namely the "Mecca" phase and the "Medina" phase. Companies in the Mecca phase need to consistently carry out an integrated corporate culture internalization program, namely as values, decision-making patterns and attitudes. Internalization of culture by using Islamic values and the meaning of prayer to influence at the individual level, work units and companies in general can open hearts, minds and wills so that job satisfaction and employee commitment can be achieved. Companies in the Medina phase have shared values that have been entrenched and internalized which have an influence on HR performance. With the company's rapid development, culture as identity; fastener; a source of inspiration, pride and resources; driving force and as a pattern of behavior needs to be maintained and passed on to the next generation.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) has been gradually valued due to its high prevalence, high risk, and high mortality. This article is to find an alternative to the polysomnography (PSG) OSAHS diagnosis method and assesses the subject&#x0027;s degree of illness considering the supply chain and Industry 5.0 requirement, efficiently, accurately and easily. The blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) signal is used to count the number of apnea or hypoventilation events. It extracts 35-dimensional features based on the time domain to enhance the process resilience, including approximate entropy, Centralized Trend Measurement (CTM), and LZ complexity for the diagnosis process in supply chains. This article summarizes the Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) characteristics. The feature selection process is reduced from 35 to 7 dimensions and benefits the implementation in the practical supply chains in industry 5.0. A 92% accuracy rate is reached in assessing the prevalence of OSAHS, satisfying the industrial deployment.

AB  - This paper aims to provide an overview of the conceptual reconstruction of learning patterns in Pasraman in an effort to increase student interest and motivation. This paper was written using the literature study method, which refers to various sources of literacy such as books, jour-nals, and other research results which are then analyzed critically. In this paper, it is explained that learning in Pasraman currently has not been able to increase student motivation, that make pasraman only has a little students. One of the reasons is the monotonous and conventional learning process. Active, Innovative, Creative, Effective and Fun Learning (PAIKEM) can be one of the solutions offered. In pasraman this model of learning can be applied with the Sad Dharma method which is elaborated with PAIKEM learn-ing models and utilizing technology. With such a learning model, it is hoped that Pasraman will be able to produce a younger generation of Hindus who understand knowledge of science, religion and technology accompanied by behavior that is in accordance with character values. In the end, Pasraman will be able to achieve the goal of existence and maintain its existence in the era of the 4.0 industrial revolution, as well as be able to produce the younger generation of Hindus who are ready to face the era of society 5.0.

Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menganalis kebijakan pemerintah tentang pengembangan guru di era society 5.0 dengan mengunakan sumber data atau referensi yang berupa buku, jurnal, prosiding dan lain-lain yang secara umum disebut library research. Terdapat beberapa kondisi dan penyebab dari rendahnya kualitas profesi guru, antara lain: 1) Belum tercapainya standarisasi kualifikasi akademik guru minimal D4/S1 sebagaimana tercantum dalam Permendiknas Nomor 16 Tahun 2007, 2) Pengembangan kompetensi guru yang seringkali terhambat karena faktor internal dan eksternal, 3) Rekrutmen guru yang tidak efektif,4) Kesejahteraan guru berupa penghasilan yang masih sangat kecil dan tidak sebanding dengan tugas guru sebagai pembentuk watak dan peradaban manusia.Walaupun kebijakan-kebijakan strategis dari pemerintah yang berkaitan dengan keempathal tersebut sudah ada, namun implementasinya masih sangat kurang apalagi jika dihubungkan dengan kebutuhan era society 5.0 yang menuntut profesionalisme guru yang handal dalam menyiapkan generasi unggul masa kini dan masa yang akan datang.
Kata kunci: kebijakan pemerintah, pengembangan guru, era society 5.0
The era of society 5.0 is a continuation of the era of the industrial revolution 4.0 which further emphasizes the side of humanism in solving social problems including education by integrating virtual and reality. This study aims to analyze government policies on teacher development in the era of society 5.0 by using data sources or references in the form of books, journals, proceedings, and others which are generally called library research. There are several conditions and causes for the low quality of the teaching profession, including: 1) The standardization of minimum academic qualifications of D4/S1 teachers has not been achieved as stated in Permendiknas No. 16 of 2007, 2) Teacher competence is often hampered due to internal and external factors, 3) Ineffective teacher recruitment, 4) Teacher welfare in the form of income which is still very small and not comparable to the teacher's duty as a form of human character and civilization. Even though strategic policies from the government relating to these five things already exist, their implementation is still lacking, especially when connected with the needs of the 5.0 era society which demands reliable professionalism in preparing superior generations today and in the future.

AB  - Problem and goal. The actual problem of digitalization means, degree and consequences of influence on fostering public and personal opinion in society is considered in the article. The purpose of the study was to show that digitalization is qualitatively changing some aspects of social life. Methodology. Determination of digitalization means, degree and consequences of influence on some aspects of social life was carried out by analysis of work results of some sites/portals devoted to events of World War II. Results. Digitalization nowadays is a process being quickly spread all around the world. It covers a wide range of human activities: business, industry, agriculture, education, healthcare, culture and social life. The process being very new, complex and challenging demands developing of a high (state) level strategy such as “ Industrie 4.0” - one of ten projects for State Hi-Tech Strategy of Germany up 2020 or “Digital Economy of the Russian Federation”. Moreover it becomes obvious that digitalization influences not only “production” but also society. In 2016 Japan released concept “Society 5.0” - a large plan of social transformations. Interesting and remarkable results in fostering some aspects of social life were also reached in the Russian Federation during preparation of Great Victory 75th anniversary celebration. Conclusion. It is demonstrated that massive digitalization of personal archives (photos, documents, family/participant of events stories, eyewitness accounts) as well as access to archived data of state institutions and possibility to translate all information for free has fostered qualitatively new personal and social attitude to remarkable historical events.

AB  - To inhibit the vegetative growth of maize plants, especially the height of the plants so that the plants do not fall easily, namely the application of paclobutrazol. In addition, increasing sweet corn production can also be done by managing pollen to ensure the availability of pollen and the success of pollination by giving boron elements (Lordkaew et al., 2011). The research was conducted on the land owned by PT. Wira Agro Nusantara Sejahtera which is located in the village of Jl. Papaya, Lamong, Pare, Kediri for 4 months starting from November 2020 to February 2021. This research was conducted using a Factorial Randomized Block Design (RBD) consisting of 2 factors. The first factor is the application time of paclobutrazol (U) which consists of 2 levels, namely U1: 30 day after plant (DAP) and U2: 40 DAP. The second factor is the dose of boron fertilizer (B) consisting of 3 levels, namely B0: 0 kg / ha, B1: 10 kg / ha, and B2: 15 kg / ha. The results showed that the application time of paclobutrazol did not affect almost all parameters, except on plant height and weight of 1000 seeds. Meanwhile, the boron dose showed a very significant effect on all production parameters, but did not have a significant effect on the germination rate and growth speed of sweet corn seeds. The interaction between paclobutrazol application time and boron dose did not significantly affect all parameters, except for the weight parameter of 1000 seeds. Dose of boron as much as 15 kg / ha gave the best effect on cob length, cob diameter, cob weight, seed weight per cob, number of seeds per cob, 1000 grain weight, and sweet corn seed production per hectare. Although not significantly from those fertilized with boron at 10 kg /ha.

AB  - In this study, a new idea of production technologies with Society 5.0 is presented. The introduction and penetration of 5G network will bring a revolutionary technological advancement in production management. Previously, under the environment of the Industry 4.0 with 4G network, a factory faced limitation of the production management, especially in sharing large scale data. The weakness related to sharing Industrial Big Data under 4G environment will be wiped out thanks to the introduction of 5G. In this study, a theoretical vision is presented with an illustration of the comparison between an Industry 4.0 Cell Production Model and a new Society 5.0 Autonomous Distributed Agent Mechanism.

AB  - While pre-fifth and fifth generation networks have been designed mainly to support machine-to-machine and human-to-human communications via data, audio, and video communications, a major thrust of beyond fifth generation Networks is the abutment of human-to-machine/robot (H2M/R) collaboration. Such collaborations are deeply anchored in the vision of Society 5.0, which promotes a human-centered society that integrates virtual and physical real spaces to resolve social problems, and Industry 5.0, which promotes intelligent manufacturing processes through collaboration between humans and cyber-physical systems. It is expected that real-time H2M/R collaborations will drive new technologies that facilitate the low-latency exchange of control signals and haptic feedback between humans and machines/robots. The low-latency constraints for real-time interaction will, however, place limits on deployable distance and the flexibility of adding new machines/robots to the system. The scalability of H2M/R collaborations across large geographical distances that also allow rapid onboarding of new machines/robots is therefore an open challenge. This article focuses on global-local AI coordinated learning (GLAD), a solution framework that supports the dynamic addition of new machines/robots and their rapid onboarding. The GLAD framework is based on learning the traffic characteristics and correlation of supported robots/machines at the local edge and global cloud. Harnessing data samples from a real H2M/R application for training and validation, GLAD enables human operators to remotely control machines/robots over extended distances through accurately forecasting their haptic feedback. By globally coordinating and sharing this learning across the network, up to 72 percent of the time can be saved when onboarding new machines/robots.

AB  - <jats:p>The article addresses the main trends in the development of world industry within the framework of Industry 4.0 and the new Industry 5.0. The main prerequisites for the emergence of the Industry 5.0 concept are studied, in particular, extensive digitization and the dynamic development of technologies of the fourth industrial revolution, which has led to the certain dehumanization of industry and has increased the interest of the scientific community in the aspects of industrial humanization, human-centeredness of industry, stability, sustainability, and resilience. The main principles and trends of the development of Industry 5.0, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, geopolitical crises, and disruptions of the global value chains on the condition and prospects for the development of world industry, new rules and requirements for global product manufacturers, technological innovations, and production trends are studied. The author identifies directions for expanding the concept of Industry 4.0 to include humanization, sustainability, and resilience. The rapid development of new technologies often outpaces the ability of organizations to align their development priorities with it and effectively take advantage of new opportunities, which leads to the need to navigate the changing business environment in time and develop a relevant development strategy. With so many technological changes, changing workforce demands, and social and regulatory priorities, there is a need to define guiding principles to help set the course for the digital industry. Industry 5.0 has become the basis for revising the future of energy, manufacturing, and mobility of supply chains, which rest on the foundations laid by Industry 4.0. The weaknesses of the Industry 4.0 concept, especially in terms of the role of a human in "smart" production and ensuring sustainable development are outlined. Accordingly, the expediency of further research and implementation of the Industry 5.0 concept is substantiated. On the basis of the conducted research on the implementation of Industry 5.0 and the world trends of industrial development, the author justifies the feasibility of reorienting production and business activities to human-centeredness as a new norm, strengthening sustainability, in particular, careful planning of stabilization measures in case of disruption of the global value chains – from factory facilities to network supplier, to transport channels, to regulatory and geopolitical changes, ensuring sustainability with manufacturers rethinking their impact on natural resources in connection with the expansion of the regulatory and legislative framework and investors' attention to reducing carbon emissions and negative impact on the environment.</jats:p>

AB  - Modernization in various sectors of life has made data and information valuable, which has an impact in changing people's lives. One of the changes is how people get information from a large amount of data to be used in the public development sector. Public policy, as a solution to solve various public problems, needs to be supported by accurate data and information facts. With a massive amount of data, this has an impact on public sector organizations to be able to store and analyze various types of information for public policies consideration. The term 'Society 5.0' has emerged, a concept that refers to revolution in people's lives through the use of technology by considering the humanities aspect. The potential for the huge benefits of big data technology is interesting to know as to whether big data can be used for the public policy formulation process. Therefore, this article will provide an overview of the implications of big data for the public policy process in society. This research uses qualitative method with literature study approach. The data came from websites and government documents related to the use of big data in public policies, analyzed using the NVivo12 Plus application. The emergence of big data, as a basis for making public policy, can be utilized for analysis, which includes social data analysis, historical data analysis, and predictive data analysis which can influence accuracy in the policy decision making. Public policy in the era of society 5.0 is vital to be realized through the use of big data as a source of information supported by technology and the readiness of actors in the policy-making process.

AB  - The round table is devoted to a discussion of the problems associated with the digitalization of modern society. The discussing questions cover a wide range of problems: the origins of the information society, its development trends, new information and communication technologies in higher education and in scientiﬁc activity, the possibility of sociological research, social networks, media, the use of Internet resources in sociological research. According to the participants, the digital wave has been launched, governments are creating digitalization programs: the Digital Economy Act, adopted by the British Parliament, has been in force since 2010, a strategy and concrete plans have been developed; USA, Singapore, Germany are already really living in a digital economy. The current digitalization boom has arisen after the world started talking about a new industrial revolution of the 21st century. The initiator was the American economist Jeremy Rifkin, who in 2011 published the book «The Third Industrial Revolution». He showed appeared technologies changing life, production and the essence of management in general. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is based on the speciﬁc Industry 4.0 project, which was prepared in Germany. It shows how to realize new opportunities in the economy, increase labor productivity, and make a breakthrough in the quality of human life in modern conditions. A new digital project Society 5.0 has been prepared in Japan. In the Republic of Belarus, the attention is paid to digitalization issues, documents governing its development have been adopted at the state level, Belarus is initiating the development of this process at the international level. In addition, the authors pay attention to the possible negative consequences of digitalization and urge not to leave this side unattended.

AB  - The possibility of understanding the dynamics of human mobility and sociality creates the opportunity to re-design the way data are collected by exploiting the crowd. We survey the last decade of experimentation and research in the field of mobile CrowdSensing, a paradigm centred on users' devices as the primary source for collecting data from urban areas. To this purpose, we report the methodologies aimed at building information about users' mobility and sociality in the form of ties among users and communities of users. We present two methodologies to identify communities: spatial and co-location-based. We also discuss some perspectives about the future of mobile CrowdSensing and its impact on four investigation areas: contact tracing, edge-based MCS architectures, digitalization in Industry 5.0 and community detection algorithms.

AB  - The role of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) in critical infrastructure sectors, such as power, chemistry, and manufacturing, will be increasingly important as we move toward Industry 5.0. For example, IIoT devices are deployed in factories to help the manufacturing companies (e.g., automotive) gain in-depth insight into the various states of production, and thus improving production efficiency and achieving cost reductions. However, malicious code may compromise IIoT devices if either the devices are exposed to outside or unexposed inner devices are updated unauthentically. Due to their limited resources and features, it is challenging to implement strong security solutions for such embedded devices. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based software status monitoring system, called BoSMoS. The system is designed to monitor the software status of IIoT devices to detect and respond to identified malicious behaviors (e.g., intrusions). BoSMoS takes a snapshot of the statue of monitored software and monitors its file system calls. In order to ensure the software integrity information, we use blockchain as the distributed ledger to store a snapshot of software status. The blockchain network of BoSMoS can employ different consensus algorithms. We also evaluate the performance of BoSMoS, in terms of exception response delay, resistance performance to various intrusions, and scalability. The experimental results justify that BoSMoS is practical and sound. In addition, the evaluation of scalability and security demonstrates that the system can carry deployment of large-scale IIoT devices and can guarantee authenticated software updating, as well as detect unauthorized software status.

AB  - <jats:p><jats:bold>Research background:</jats:bold> At a time when we are looking for ways to recover the economy most effectively from a global pandemic, digitalization represents a significant opportunity. This is a specific aspect of digitalization, i.e. automation through artificial intelligence-driven technologies, in various areas of society, particularly in the industry and related education.</jats:p>
<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose of the article:</jats:bold> The aim of this article is to present the changes in the labour market and education in the context of the global pandemic. Even after the end of the pandemic, it will be necessary to continue increasing productivity through the use of modem technologies. Education will no longer be tailored to one profession, as it has been so far, but shall emphasise interdisciplinarity, comprehensiveness, creativity and flexibility. The Fifth Industrial Revolution (Industry 5.0) will logically follow. It is a vision of the return of a man and his creativity to the production processes.</jats:p>
<jats:p><jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> The paper analyses the survey of the international research into the global crisis caused by the pandemic using desk research and mathematical statistics methods.</jats:p>
<jats:p><jats:bold>Findings and added value:</jats:bold> Many professions tend to be at risk as work becomes increasingly digitalized and automated. This article looks at the possible evolution of the market and the emergence of new professions that cannot be imagined now. Therefore, it is very important to focus education in all areas of society to prepare the graduates to be able to flexibly respond to changes in the labour market requirements.</jats:p>

AB  - The fifth Industrial Revolution is a term that is currently emerging even though the world is still adjusting to the changes being brought upon by the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The advent of IR 5.0 will allow humans to challenge the conventional and pre-existing concepts in product design through widespread industrial applications of human-centred cyber physical systems and stretch the technological boundaries in the development of novel materials to satisfy the demands for mass personalization. In the production of biopolymers and fine chemicals, the fields of white or industrial biotechnology and synthetic biology opens new avenues in the personalization of the products according to the consumer needs. Evolutionary algorithms would be used to further optimize a production line and improve its flexibility to cater for on-demand customization of the products by the clients. The inevitable challenges faced by the pioneers of IR 5.0 and future prospects in the production of biopolymers and fine chemicals would also be discussed in this chapter.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to provide inputs for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in facing the era of Industry 5.0. Many perceive Industry 5.0 as a continuation of the fourth industrial revolution that utilizes ‘big data’ on the internet to run a business. The approach used in this study was literature study, which was intended to examine the current events, especially in the production process. A number of documentary videos from several sources, including YouTube, National Geographic channel and other sources, were retrieved to examine the changes in the industrial trends in various parts of the world. As a result, it can be concluded that the challenges faced by SMEs in establishing business in Industry 5.0 mainly relate to product excellence. Facing the new era, local SMEs have several advantages that have to be developed due to the involvement of human ‘touch’ in the business processes. Some products are potentially irreplaceable despite the changes of industrial trend, namely products with special characteristics such as handicrafts and natural resources based products. For SMEs in Indonesia, there are other advantages in addition to the special characteristics in the processes and final products, which are the national and cultural values of Indonesia

AB  - Advanced manufacturing solutions, augmented reality, and cloud and big data are technologies pertaining to Industry 4.0. These technologies improve working conditions, create new business models, and increase both productivity and firm quality production. However, they can also improve life and society as a whole. This new perspective, oriented toward social and global well-being, is called Society 5.0. As has happened for all past industrial revolutions, Industry 4.0 will support the transition to a different society, i.e., Society 5.0. In this transition, open innovation and value co-creation can play an important role. The aim of the study was twofold: to examine how Industry 4.0 features and enabling technologies can support the transition to Society 5.0 and to investigate the roles of both open innovation and value co-creation within this transition. A conceptual framework was developed to jointly consider for the first time Industry 4.0, Society 5.0, open innovation, and value co-creation, which are all challenging issues that firms must cope with nowadays. Managers could profit from these insights to design ad hoc strategies in order to benefit from the opportunities emerging from this transition and overcome the main related challenges.

AB  - The Fifth Industrial Revolution or Industry 5.0, places emphasis on personalization and the interaction between man and machine. It has brought us to Pharma 5.0, a combination of traditional biomanufacturing practices and industrial production with the latest smart technology and artificial intelligence use. These revolutionary changes can be applied to all production line aspects, from drug conception to final consumption by the consumers while still acknowledging the digitalization challenges and security issues associated. In this chapter, the ultimate integration of human and machine is discussed with the invention of bionics, for example, bionic vision and bionic limbs. The role of technology in these new manufacturing systems, such as small-scale agile manufacturing and mass production with advances occurring on the factory floor, are also detailed in this chapter. A few challenges still remain, including the impact on job security, ethical issues, problems with data processing and challenges in designing for human-computer interaction, which also need to be identified, analyzed and overcome before a transformation to the Fifth Industrial Revolution can be realized. Finally, prospective research into human-computer integration and further personalization is studied to foresee and predict imminent technologies that will become significant in Industry 5.0.

AB  - <jats:p>Modern development of the noosphere, the emergence of new industries and a qualitative transformation of production and distribution relations are determined by widespread digitalization throughout the world. The main goals of digitalization are the development of innovations focused on the development of society 5.0, ensuring the free flow of data and capital. Considering the Mundell-Fleming model application as the instrument to support economic welfare it should be admitted the “impossible trinity” of the model and the lack of research to solve it. The paper investigates the Mundell-Fleming dilemma solution on the ground of digitalization. The research methodology is based on fundamental tenets of modern economics and general scientific methods, namely: induction, deduction, dialectical method and systematic approach, analysis and synthesis – all of these for analyzing the process of digitalization and to establish the principles, forms and foundations of the Mundell-Fleming model application in the digital dimension, systematization and generalization (to substantiate the phenomenon of digitalization), abstract-logical method (for recent tendencies substantiation), economic-mathematical (to compare and analyze data), institutional-comparative (for the analysis Mundell-Fleming model application in the digital economy). The paper studies the Mundell-Fleming model application in digital economy, it investigates global trends as well as peculiarities of digitalization in Ukrainian economy. We believe digitalization is the instrument to solve the Mundell-Fleming trilemma. The study reveals trends of banking digitalization as external as internal.</jats:p>

AB  - The territory is central. Both geographic and human, it brings together a complex set of fields: public, political, economic, social, etc. To ignore this heterogeneity is ultimately to impose blinders on yourself and only look at a small part of the territorial reality. A territory that controls its stakeholders offers vigilant 360 ° governance. The choice of a "5.0" management of the territory, centered on people and criteria of sustainability : People remain central in making any decision. Whether they are decision-makers themselves or citizens, the different environments (economic, social, political, etc.) are directly impacted by humans. Through its choices and actions, it generates positive as well as negative developments. The sustainability of the territory must be understood, therefore, as the capacity to maintain human activities over the long term. Based on the principle of resilience and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, this 5.0 strategic management opens up a field of possibilities and innovations in the just governance of a territory.

AB  - Performance of a construction project could be influenced by a number of attributes, especially large and complex projects lay additional focus on the success / failure attributes, because of the intensive amount of money invested, a high degree of uncertainty, the complexity of personnel’s required, a multiplicity of goals and problems in coordination between different stakeholders encountered. In this research paper, the author intended to define and examine the relationship and impact of construction productivity (CP) over construction project performance (CPP). The author tests the proposition that there is a positive relationship/impact between both of them. And to test the effect of factors is affecting CP on CPP and to propose a conceptual model on the basis of the analysis. To validate the mathematical validity of factor analysis, Spearman correlation analysis has been performed on the factors. And to check the reliability of all the factors using reliability analysis, and finally test the hypothesis that construction productivity is having a positive impact on project performance using one sample t-test. The findings of the study concluded that there is a positive impact of construction productivity on project performance in Indian construction projects. This paper attempts to identify the relationship between CP and CPP and recommends the framework for the industry to grow sustainably and deliver projects successfully.

With Industry 4.0 being unable to address and meet increased drive of personalization, the term Industry 5.0 was coined for addressing personalized manufacturing and empowering humans in manufacturing processes. The onset of the term Industry 5.0 is observed to have various views of how it is defined and what constitutes the reconciliation between humans and machines. This serves as the motivation of this paper in identifying and analyzing the various themes and research trends of what Industry 5.0 is using text mining tools and techniques. Toward this, the abstracts of 196 published papers based on the keyword “Industry 5.0” search in IEEE, science direct and MDPI data bases were extracted. Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed for further analysis to apply text mining techniques of key terms extraction and frequency analysis. Further topic mining i.e., unsupervised machine learning method was used for exploring the data. It is observed that the terms artificial intelligence (AI), big data, supply chain, digital transformation, machine learning, internet of things (IoT), are among the most often used and among several enablers that have been identified by researchers to drive Industry 5.0. Five major themes of Industry 5.0 addressing, supply chain evaluation and optimization, enterprise innovation and digitization, smart and sustainable manufacturing, transformation driven by IoT, AI, and Big Data, and Human-machine connectivity were classified among the published literature, highlighting the research themes that can be further explored. It is observed that the theme of Industry 5.0 as a gateway towards human machine connectivity and co-existence is gaining more interest among the research community in the recent years.</jats:p>

AB  - This article seeks to describe the spread of Japan's Society 5.0 topic outside Japan based on Google's search results in 2019. Japan's Society 5.0 needs to be discussed because the global aspect of Japan's Society 5.0, namely the spread via the internet and Google, has not been researched widely. Even though, the Government of Japan committed as a role model for the world with Society 5.0 . The method used in this article is a case study with data from Google Trends. The concept used is the globalization from Thomas Friedman. The results of this article show that the topic of Japan's Society 5.0 has attracted foreign public attention in several countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, India, and the United States. Then, the public in these countries also used Google to find out topics related to Japan's Society 5.0. For example, the topics of society, industry, the industrial revolution, and Industry 4.0. The spread of Japan's Society 5.0 topic in various countries can be stated in line with Thomas Friedman's argumentation on globalization which is centered on Information and Communications Technology (ICT) development. Artikel ini berupaya untuk mendeskripsikan penyebaran topik Society 5.0 Jepang di luar Jepang berdasarkan hasil pencarian Google pada tahun 2019. Society 5.0 Jepang perlu untuk dibahas karena aspek global dari Society 5.0 Jepang yaitu penyebaran melalui internet dan Google belum terlalu dikaji secara luas. Padahal, Pemerintah Jepang memiliki komitmen untuk menjadi percontohan bagi dunia dengan Society 5.0 . Metode yang digunakan dalam artikel ini adalah studi kasus dengan data dari Google Trends. Konsep yang digunakan adalah globalisasi dari Thomas Friedman. Hasil artikel ini memperlihatkan topik Society 5.0 Jepang menjadi perhatian publik asing di beberapa negara seperti Indonesia, Malaysia, India, dan Amerika Serikat. Lalu, publik di negara-negara tersebut juga menggunakan Google untuk mencari tahu topik yang terkait dengan Society 5.0 Jepang. Contohnya adalah topik masyarakat, industri, revolusi industri, dan Industry 4.0 . Penyebaran topik Society 5.0 Jepang di berbagai negara dapat dinyatakan sejalan dengan argumentasi globalisasi dari Thomas Friedman yang berpusat pada perkembangan Teknologi Informasi dan Komunikasi (TIK).

AB  - <jats:p>The article examines the foundations of educational innovations in the Krestovozdvszhensk Labor Brotherhood, which was founded by the famous philosopher, landowner and philanthropist N. N. Neplyuev in the 1880s, 30 km to North of Glukhov. It shows the socio-economic successes that the community could achieve in the production and social spheres. Educational innovations, due to which young brothers were brought up, are characterized: the need for constant practical application of innovative technologies and methods of work, reproduction of motives for self-learning and obtaining new knowledge, conditionality of constant decision-making, self-organization and self-government, etc. Methods of organization, social relations, approach to production activities along which the Brotherhood lived, days with the present. In particular, the focus of the Brotherhood's economy on the use of renewable resources and ensuring the sustainable state of adjacent ecosystems brings it closer to the goals and objectives of the Third Industrial Revolution, which is now taking place in the world. The priority of information production in the Brotherhood and its focus on the mechanization of labor processes make it clearer the logics of the modern Fourth Industrial Revolution clearer. And, finally, the invaluable achievement of the brothers is the priority they have achieved of a human personality development. This is what is now becoming essential in the light of the Fifth Industrial Revolution. It is especially noted that the Brotherhood, thanks to its educational system, managed to create a unique reproductive potential, which included: a system of necessary self-reproduction of human personalities; system of reproduction of the most effective use and reproduction of natural capital; system of reproduction of synergetic combination of human, natural and physical capitals.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>All the theories about market and marketing research, customer relationship management, and business in general, believe that customer satisfaction is one of the main factors for company financial success. However, a survey on 64 studies shows a wide variation of the correlation between customer satisfaction and financial performance. The correlation coefficients are varied from -0.256 to 0.899. This study applies a meta-analysis on those 64 studies’ findings to find the true correlation between customer satisfaction and financial performance. The analysis clusters the 64 studies based on year of research, business category observed, and geographical area of research. The result shows that the correlation between customer satisfaction and financial performance is relatively high (0.525) before 1990, becomes confusing (not-significantly correlated) in 1991-2000, increases (0.626) in 2001-2010, and decreases (0.595) after 2011. Based on business category, the two variables are not significantly correlated both in manufacturing industries and in service industries. The two variables are significantly correlated according to the studies conducted in Europe region (0.566) and Asia-Africa (0.657), but could not to be proven significantly correlated in USA region. The insights from the meta-analysis findings are: (1) the customer satisfaction role is change by time as well as the changes of industry environment, so that research on customer satisfaction will always be beneficial; (2) in individualist society like USA, further researches on customer behavior and culture are required to find more clear explanation about the role of customer satisfaction as well as other financial success factors, on the company performance. </jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>In the last few decades, there has been a growing necessity for systems that handle market changes and personalized customer needs with near mass production efficiency, defined as the new mass customization paradigm. The Industry 5.0 vision further enhances the human-centricity aspect, in the necessity for manufacturing systems to cooperate with workers, taking advantage of their problem-solving capabilities, creativity, and expertise of the manufacturing process. A solution is to develop a flexible manufacturing system capable of handling different customer requests and real-time decisions from operators. This paper tackles these aspects by proposing a digital twin of a robotic system for solution preparation capable of making real-time scheduling decisions and forecasts using a simulation model while allowing human interventions. A discrete event simulation model was used to forecast possible system improvements. The simulation handles real-time scheduling considering the possibility of adding identical parallel machines. Results show that processing multiple jobs simultaneously with more than one machine on critical processes, increasing the robot speed, and using heuristics that emphasize the shortest transportation time can reduce the overall completion time by 82%. The simulation model has an animated visualization window for a deeper understanding of the system.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Technological innovations play a crucial role in designing an effective green supply chain. However, it is crucial to know the factors influencing technological innovation in a green supply chain. Some preconceptions show that technological innovation in a business can be affected by internal and external factors, and therefore there must be correlations between such factors to flourish the technological innovation and, subsequently, the green supply chain. Besides, predicting the technological innovation level in a supply chain can be vital and direct it to the Industry 5.0 goals. In this research, a 3-phased framework will be proposed to predict the Technological Innovation Level of Green Supply Chains. The scope of this research includes Green Investment, Eco-friendly Design and Customer Collaborations. In the 1st phase of the framework, dependent and independent factors considering the scope of the Research will be determined; and then, using statistical data analysis, the weight of factors, which reflects their impact on technological innovation (dependent factor), will be determined. Then, in the 2nd phase, a comprehensive model will be developed and trained. Using the data of supply chains that were gathered in the first phase, the train and test data would be selected. In continuation, the model will be trained and its performance will be evaluated using some metrics. Then, in the last phase (phase 3), the developed model will be used to predict the technological level of supply chains. The outcomes of this research can help top managers of supply chains to predict the level of technological innovation by investing a certain budget in improving the dependent variables. The outcomes demonstrated that Customer Collaboration (0.481), Eco-friendly design (0.419) and Green Investment (0.41) have significant impacts on technological innovation improvement in the studied cases, respectively. Besides, the results showed the superiority of the K-nearest Neighbor algorithm while using the Minkowski distance method and considering 5 neighbors. The findings indicated that the proposed framework could predict Technological Innovation with 0.751 accuracies. The outcomes of this research can be helpful for industry owners to predict the expected technological innovation level of their system by investing a certain budget in green investment, eco-friendly design and customer collaborations in their enterprises.</jats:p>

AB  - This chapter presents an approach to modeling smart city subsystems based on the principle of their cyber-physical integration into a single infrastructure. The uniqueness of the approach is the provision of the smart city topology as a set of cyber-physical clusters that ensure the functioning of the city. Unlike existing solutions, the proposed approach allows to consider the relationship of the information flows between different levels of smart city systems. Considered features of modeling of the cyber-physical water supply system (including active control system models, resource allocation models, scenario modeling) were put into practice by the smart city infrastructure in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The analysis of the functioning of the megalopolis water supply enterprise revealed significant vulnerabilities in ensuring the strategic security of the Leningrad Region, Russia. A basic list of recommendations for reducing the probability of water shortage has been developed based on scenario modeling of disabling of the main water supply source. These results are the basis for creating simulation models of interrupting the main source of smart city water supply and considering issues of improving the efficiency of water supply cyber-physical systems control in the smart city.

AB  - Manufacturing systems under Industry 4.0, and their transition towards Industry 5.0, take into account the Quintuple Helix innovation model, associated with the sustainable development goals (SDGs) set by the UN and Horizon 2030, in which companies focus on operational efficiency in terms of the use and minimisation of resources for the protection of the environment. In this respect, the implementation of the circular economy model, which requires engineers to acquire appropriate competencies, enabling companies to establish this model at the manufacturing level. Moreover, competence has always been a priority for both the professional and the company. In this sense, connectivism has been called a learning theory for the digital era; this is the reason why a review of the state-of-the-art developments of this paradigm focused on engineering has been carried out. In this sense, the potential of the digital transformation in instruction to formulate an engineering model based on neuro-competences is of great interest, taking the connectivist paradigm as a methodological axis. To this end, a first bibliometric analysis has been carried out to identify the drivers on which to base the design of the neuro-competencies of the instructional engineering environment and the trend towards curriculum development under dual training models. The bibliographical research carried out on the connectivist paradigm has served to identify the trends followed to date in education within the subject area of engineering. These trends have not fully taken into account the leading role of the human factor within the socio-technical cyber-physical systems of sustainable manufacturing (SCSSM). The focus was more on the technology than on the adaptation of the uniqueness of the human factor and the tasks entrusted to him, which entails an additional complexity that needs to be addressed in both academic and professional contexts. In light of the foregoing, an improvement to the acquisition and management of competencies has been proposed to the academic, professional and dual engineering contexts. It is based on the transversal inclusion of the concept of neuro-competence applied to the competence engineering (CE) model, transforming it into the neuro-competence engineering (NCE) model. The foregoing provides a better match between the characteristics of the human factor and the uniqueness of the tasks performed by the engineer, incorporating activity theory (AT), the law of variety required (LVR), the connectivist paradigm and neuroscience as a transversal driver of innovation through fractality. This proposal enables a ubiquitous and sustainable learning model throughout the entire academic and professional life cycle of the engineer, placing it sustainably at the heart of the instructional and professional cyber-physical socio-technical system, thus complying with the SDGs set by the UN and Horizon 2030.

AB  - Technology acceptance model (TAM) is arguably the most widely used intention theory that explains the individual’s acceptance of a certain technology.  Since Davis introduced TAM in 1986, it has been applied and validated in a variety of disciplines, including educational sciences. However, scholars note that depending on a specific context, the original TAM needs to be extended, which has been done by introducing external variables and other theories. Despite the existent TAM2 and TAM3, numerous scholars still opt for the original TAM, extending it with the variables and theories that are relevant to the specific context of their study. The aim of the present paper is to provide an overview of validated TAM extensions, which might later help to further the understanding of educational technology acceptance, which is a prerequisite of its adoption. Since interdisciplinarity in various contexts is becoming more and more common, the overview presents TAM extensions that come from a number of different disciplines. The overview is based on 108 papers that were retrieved from the Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics) by searching for the keywords ‘extended Technology Acceptance Model’, ‘extended TAM’, and ‘TAM extension’.

AB  - Enterprises and societies currently face crucial challenges, while Industry 4.0 becomes important in the global manufacturing industry all the more. Industry 4.0 offers a range of opportunities for companies to increase the flexibility and efficiency of production processes. The development of new business models can be promoted with digital platforms and architectures for Industry 4.0. Therefore, products from the healthcare sector can increase in value. The adaptive integrated digital architecture framework (AIDAF) for Industry 4.0 is expected to promote and implement the digital platforms and robotics for healthcare and medical communities efficiently. In this paper, we propose that various digital platforms and robotics are designed and evaluated for digital healthcare as for manufacturing industry with Industry 4.0. We argue that the design of an open healthcare platform “Open Healthcare Platform 2030 - OHP2030” for medical product design and robotics can be developed with AIDAF. The vision of AIDAF applications to enable Industry 4.0 in the OHP2030 research initiative is explained and referenced, extended in the context of Society 5.0.

AB  - <jats:p>Increasing volatility and product individualization are leading to higher complexity in manual assembly. At the same time, production and processes must become more flexible, and humans have to adapt to new products more often and even faster. Industry 5.0 will increasingly focus on human-centric approaches, on the collaboration of humans and machines intensively using cognitive assistance systems. The design of an innovative cognitive assistance system is a complex task due to the many technological opportunities and their interrelationships. In the framework of this research, a method was developed enabling the systematic design of cognitive assistance systems that integrates business and worker requirements aiming at improving productivity, quality, worker satisfaction and well-being. The research question was approached by design science research having, as the main output, a systematic and innovative method for the design of cognitive assistance systems based on quality function deployment (QFD), referred to as cognitive assistance system-QFD (CAS-QFD). The developed methodology is divided into six phases and includes the iterative design of a cognitive assistance system starting from the assembly process. The method considers the information needs of the workers, the definition of the appropriate assistance functions and the selection of the interaction technologies. The exemplarily industrial evaluation highlighted the relevance of CAS-QFD for systematically designing cognitive assistance systems based on holistic requirements, identified at the worker, workplace, production area and, finally, at the enterprise level.</jats:p>

AB  - Ever since its discovery, the applications of Shape Memory Alloys (SMA) can be found across a range of application domains, from structural design to medical technology. This is based upon the unique and inherent characteristics such as thermal Shape Memory Effect (SME) and Superelasticity (or Pseudoelasticity). While thermal SME is used for shape morphing applications wherein temperature change can govern the shape and dimension of the SMA, Superelasticity allows the alloy to withstand a comparatively very high magnitude of loads without undergoing plastic deformation at higher temperatures. These unique properties in wearables have revolutionized the field, and from fabrics to exoskeletons, SMA has found its place in robotics and cobotics. This review article focuses on the most recent research work in the field of SMA-based smart wearables paired with robotic applications for human-robot interaction. The literature is categorized based on SMA property incorporated and on actuator or sensor-based concept. Further, use-cases or conceptual frameworks for SMA fiber in fabric for '<i>Smart Jacket</i>' and SMA springs in the shoe soles for '<i>Smart Shoes</i>' are proposed. The conceptual frameworks are built upon existing technologies; however, their utility in a smart factory concept is emphasized, and algorithms to achieve the same are proposed. The integration of the two concepts with the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is discussed, specifically regarding minimizing hazards for the worker/user in Industry 5.0. The article aims to propel a discussion regarding the multi-faceted applications of SMAs in human-robot interaction and Industry 5.0. Furthermore, the challenges and the limitations of the smart alloy and the technological barriers restricting the growth of SMA applications in the field of smart wearables are observed and elaborated.

AB  - As part of city development, the identity of a place is taking high priority. The different appearance and activities during the day and night will provide a different spatial experience in terms of the identity of the city. Bandung, as one of the cities in Indonesia, has several places that deliver a strong identity, one of which is Jalan Asia Africa, which has significant historical value to create the identity of Bandung. This study was conducted to identify and review the identity of the Asia Africa corridor at night, using the theory of lighting scheme from the elements that build its corridor. As result, the identity of Asia Africa corridor as a public space with strong historical value is supported by its warm color temperature, heightened position of the light source, repetitive density, and the up-lighting. This study can be used as a reference for future lighting design improvements.

AB  - Change are grew rapidly. The technological era in the industrial era 4.0 supports these changes. However, this era caused panic among people who thought that this era caused a lot of use of technology to achieve prosperity and a lack of use of human resources. The era of society 5.0 is different from that era where technology is considered not the main factor, but human resources as the main factor supporting prosperity, technology plays a role as a supporter. This research is conducted in Islamic boarding schools in East Java, where the pesantren is a unique part of society. This study aims to describe the role of Social Bounding, Social Bridging and Social Linking in Islamic boarding schools and to find out how this can increase the Value Economy of students as part of society in facing the era of society 5.0. By using a qualitative research method descriptive study, it can be seen that social bounding has different characteristics from what Woolcock suggests, namely by planting values, culture, perceptions and traditions from religious sources, state law, and instilling the Pancasila ideology. Social bridging does not have a significant difference, namely by improving community weaknesses and maximizing potential. Likewise social linking with the use of networks to help achieve goals. Meanwhile, in relation to creating a value economy in the future, skills training through extra activities are needed. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the capacity of the teaching staff so that they are able to innovate for development

AB  - <jats:p>Industry 4.0 (Fourth Industrial Revolution) and green process manufacturing are similar to each other and work closely as they are new concepts in manufacturing production &amp; operations management. Today the need of expansion in businesses directly leads to adoption of new concepts of manufacturing and also making awareness of those used processes to ultimate consumers is needed. Industry 4.0 is related to the processes with latest technologies such as clean-green energy, automation, internet of things (IoT) and digitization, whereas, green manufacturing is almost similar like use of fewer natural resources, reduction in pollution &amp; waste, reducing carbon footprints, recycle &amp; reuse of material and moderate emission in processes. Country’s sustainable growth right now is major among other strategies and every country is trying and working hard to incorporate the development process through adoption of these types of tools &amp; techniques. Industry 4.0 technologies and green manufacturing relate to “Green Dialogue” and to some extent proving the object also. Now, introduction of Industry 5.0 is welcoming fully fledged automation of industries with green processes like G-IoT. However, climate health, consumers health and production &amp; operation health is on priority to have healthier green clean sustainable development in the world. From the above title, the purpose of this study is to present the potential of the industries
under new industrial revolution with the combination to eco-friendly manufacturing leading to knowledge of the updated technologies used for their respective ecological production &amp; operation management. These concepts are considered to be new around the world and most of the developed countries are more active in accepting these
sustainable concepts in their operations and production in industries. Developing countries like India are way behind in acquiring these concepts as manufacturing is aware but not willing to pay extra cost of production in advancing the operation &amp; production process. Most of the top manufacturers of India have already started using this sustainable process as they have to prove their responsibility towards society at large by Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) also.</jats:p>

AB  - Climate change, the growth in world population, high levels of food waste and food loss, and the risk of new disease or pandemic outbreaks are examples of the many challenges that threaten future food sustainability and the security of the planet and urgently need to be addressed. The fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0, has been gaining momentum since 2015, being a significant driver for sustainable development and a successful catalyst to tackle critical global challenges. This review paper summarizes the most relevant food Industry 4.0 technologies including, among others, digital technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, big data analytics, Internet of Things, and blockchain) and other technological advances (e.g., smart sensors, robotics, digital twins, and cyber-physical systems). Moreover, insights into the new food trends (such as 3D printed foods) that have emerged as a result of the Industry 4.0 technological revolution will also be discussed in Part II of this work. The Industry 4.0 technologies have significantly modified the food industry and led to substantial consequences for the environment, economics, and human health. Despite the importance of each of the technologies mentioned above, ground-breaking sustainable solutions could only emerge by combining many technologies simultaneously. The Food Industry 4.0 era has been characterized by new challenges, opportunities, and trends that have reshaped current strategies and prospects for food production and consumption patterns, paving the way for the move toward Industry 5.0.

AB  - The fifth industrial revolution brings in massive advantages, providing candidates with a more personalized experience in their job search. Industry 5.0 recognizes the power of industry in achieving societal goals beyond jobs and growth to become a resilient provider of prosperity by directing production towards respecting the boundaries of our planet and placing the well-being of the industry worker at the center of the production process. Contrary to the trends in Industry 4.0 toward technology, dehumanization, technological advancement and innovation best practices, Industry 5.0 will bend back toward serving humanity. At workplaces, this industrial revolution will shed greater light on the human intelligence than ever. The challenge now is to examine the influence of soft skills to enhance the workforce in order to prepare them for Industry 5.0. Emotional intelligence is a soft skill. The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of emotional intelligence on enhancing the workforce for Industry 5.0. A total of 110 executives took part in this study. Findings suggest that emotional intelligence does influence the workforce to perform better. Emotional recognition and expression and emotions direct cognition were found to have a greater impact on the performance.

AB  - <jats:p>Needs for new competences and knowledge arise as industry 4.0 evolves in increasingly digitalized production. This development entails that job transformations and future skills need attention from the perspective of industry 5.0, where human and machine find ways of working together to improve production performance. Facing this perspective, one challenge is a growing need for novel lifelong learning initiatives, to meet emerging and altering occupations for the fulfilment of future skill requirements. This challenge is addressed here by portraying a case where three Swedish universities have formed a distinctive collaboration to develop a flexible (i.e. blended) course for professionals, in the subject of Digitally-enabled production. The purpose is to develop a sustainable collaboration between the universities and create a course format on master level addressing lifelong learning for the increasingly digitalized production. The ambition is to increase the impact of the universities respective efforts by sharing resources and utilizing individual specialized expertise to develop a practical and relevant course that can reach a larger target group. The course encompasses industry 4.0 readiness on three levels of production systems; plant-, production cell-, and component level; to adopt a holistic view of digitalization in production. We followed an action research approach for continuously collecting and documenting our experiences during the course development, implementation, and dissemination of the course. Within the frame of action research, an explorative case study describes and analyzes the initiative. The results highlight challenges and opportunities for succeeding with this form of co-produced course. The joint course gives professionals possibilities to work on cases from their own companies with expert supervision from three manufacturing levels to address complex challenges in industry 4.0 implementation. To conclude, the importance of lifelong learning in relation to the human-centric approach of industry 5.0 is emphasized as a future direction.</jats:p>

AB  - The Japanese demography is drastically changing. It has seen a rapid increase in the elderly population and a decrease in the birth rate. This caused Japan to be a hyper-ageing society. Japanese’s first Baby-boomers who were born in 1947-1949 are now entering old age. Elderly care is a major problem in Japan. Children and care-workers for elderly parents are scarce. Therefore, the second Baby-boomers (born in 1971-1974) aged 40-50 years old have quit working to care for their elderly parents. This situation is known as ‘kaigo rishoku.’ This study looked into the practice of elderly care in Japanese 5.0 Society. Society 5.0 is a concept developed by Japan. It is human-centred and technology-based. In society 5.0, robots and the internet play an essential role in human life. Therefore, we proposed a critical question: Can robots replace humans to care for the elderly in Society 5.0? This study used the qualitative method with a phenomenological approach and descriptive analysis. The results revealed that although robots can assist elderly care, due to the high cost, only a certain elderly can buy them. Therefore, in order for robots to become caregivers of the future, mass production is needed. Thus, robots can be marketed at relatively lower prices. However, sick elderly who live alone still need human assistance. On the one hand, technology helps human life in Society 5.0. On the other hand, the human touch is still necessary for elderly care.

AB  - Service growth in manufacturing firms is in active research in the domain of servitization and open to various new conceptualizations. Servitization is reinventing the business model solely from manufacturer to service provider. The concept is practiced in industries to sell their product with outcome as a service. Various manufacturers are adding service as an integral component with product rather than simply after-sales services. Industries such as photocopier and farm equipment industries, engine manufacturers, and many more, including software service providers, are practicing servitization. Manufacturers get various benefits of the servitization as a business model. By offering advanced services, they qualify for better competition, and few benefits include enhanced revenue, improved customer requirements, better innovative products, loyal customer base, and creating high entry barrier to competitors. The potential to achieve such benefits is causing a growing number of manufacturers to explore the servitization as a good business model, and especially advanced services. However, precisely how to deliver advanced services is a challenge for many companies. Customer requirements are increasingly getting complex everyday. High-tech equipment, customers’ trust on it and dealers who provide these equipment and their services are increasing more than ever. Manufacturers, instead of focusing solely on selling a product, are revamping their approach to match the increasing desires of their customers. This chapter summarizes an inquiry into earlier work done in servitization and the future scope of work. The way firms are now shifting to service domain has demonstrated their trust and proved its impact on profitability. The use of innovative Internet of things (IoT) and data mining softwares, and its amalgamation with manufacturing equipment and customers’ expectations force manufacturers to adopt newer methodologies and serve better.

AB  - Abstract The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in a smart society, in which the analysis of human habits is mandatory, requires automated data scheduling and analysis using smart applications, a smart infrastructure, smart systems, and a smart network. In this context, which is characterized by a large gap between training and operative processes, a dedicated method is required to manage and extract the massive amount of data and the related information mining. The method presented in this work aims to reduce this gap with near-zero-failure advanced diagnostics (AD) for smart management, which is exploitable in any context of Society 5.0, thus reducing the risk factors at all management levels and ensuring quality and sustainability. We have also developed innovative applications for a human-centered management system to support scheduling in the maintenance of operative processes, for reducing training costs, for improving production yield, and for creating a human–machine cyberspace for smart infrastructure design. The results obtained in 12 international companies demonstrate a possible global standardization of operative processes, leading to the design of a near-zero-failure intelligent system that is able to learn and upgrade itself. Our new method provides guidance for selecting the new generation of intelligent manufacturing and smart systems in order to optimize human–machine interactions, with the related smart maintenance and education.

AB  - Digital technologies, autonomous systems, and artificial intelligence are seen as mater-of-course parts of the world today. Japan, as one of the leading countries in technological innovations, is the most advanced in terms of approach to digital society. Japanese society and government have been working on a new concept of life where all the digital technologies will communicate through the internet. Society organised in this way is called Society 5.0 - super Smart society. In Japan, this concept is centred about seventeen sustainable goals (United Nations, 2018). Society 5.0 is a reaction to the fundamental technological revolutionary changes known today as Industry 4.0. Thus, Society 5.0 is the consequence of a technological revolution that will eventually affect not just the production but all parts of today's life as well.The new technologies evoke some fundamental philosophical and existential questions. How can technological advances improve the prosperity and functioning of society? What about the privacy and security of all the users? The present paper compares Japan and the Czech Republic from the perspective of digitalization of society based on three main aspects: government programs supporting digital technologies, number of technically educated experts and investments in science and research. The objective is to find out how much the Czech Republic has advanced towards preparations for digital society.

AB  - Nowadays, as Indonesia is preparing its human resources to reach the Industry 4.0 stage, it turns out that other parts of the world have reached the Industry 5.0 stage. Unlike Industry 4.0, Industry 5.0 continues to rely on the role of human beings, and is human-centered in its use, so that the role of human beings is not degraded or replaced. The role of humans in Industry 5.0, in addition to having a positive impact, also has the potential of leading to negative impacts, which are now widely found in the circulation of hoaxes, online persecution (doxing), and also online radicalization, which are spread using the Internet. The sources of the data in this study are the results of in-depth interviews with social observers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and Indonesia Tanpa Pacaran members as primary data sources. The findings of this study reinforce the notion that Indonesia Tanpa Pacaran is a highly exclusionary movement. This movement is hostile to people outside their groups on the basis of differences in identity and extreme understanding of Islamic values. Besides, this movement is also found to be radical, because it encourages marriage by ignoring the process of becoming acquainted, and the social dynamics between individuals. Another finding is that this movement also has the potential to encourage social conflict in a pluralistic Indonesian society.

AB  - Organizations have been introduced to a new form of productive organization, called Industry 4.0, with the promise of integrating their processes, high customization, high production and reduced production costs. Based on the concepts of Industry 4.0, several variations emerged, such as Logistics 4.0, Health 4.0, and Agriculture 4.0. However, it was in Japan that the idea Society 5.0 emerged, which promises the application of all aspects of the fourth revolution and its consequences in a fully autonomous society. The present work compares Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0 in relation to origin, structuring elements and use of technology. The methodology used was a bibliographical research. The result presents a list of 10 characteristics that compare the year of creation of the concept, country of origin, motivating need, level of urgency, focus, scope of application, use of technology, degree of use of artificial intelligence, fundamental elements and developments from the concept. Contributions to the practice are based on the establishment of differences that can contribute so that strategists, investors and production managers can understand the differences and envision a near future.

AB  - Within recent years, there has been a rapid expansion of the University's role in economic development. This has resulted in University Technology Transfer (UTT) taking place within an increasingly complex network of regional stakeholders. This complexity has resulted in quadruple helix models where the triple helix model of academia, industry and regional government now includes societal based innovation users as a fourth helix. Despite this development, extant research is fragmented and lacks coherent frameworks and conceptualisations which fully depict the dynamic and evolving nature of UTT. Accordingly, this article reviews Mode 2 UTT from a quadruple helix perspective to identify key themes to develop a research agenda which reflects progression from a triple into a quadruple helix ecosystem.

AB  - <jats:p>Fourth industrial revolution is the introduction of ICT (mostly IoT) in industry and elsewhere, which enables the creation of cyber-physical systems, i.e., digital twins of reality. The application of widespread digitization of processes brings changes in terms of increased efficiency of processes, increased flexibility of production, and the possibility of realizing prosocial and pro-ecological goals, such as sustainable development, sustainable production and consumption, and reducing the consumption of increasingly expensive energy. Nowadays, the high autonomy of cyber-physical systems and benefits to society are expected by including human factors within the Industry 5.0 concept. Implementing the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies and meeting the expectations of sustainable development also means new challenges for the knowledge and skills of industry employees, mainly engineers implementing modern solutions. Hence, the article’s aim is to identify the critical knowledge and skills of engineers responsible for implementing the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies. The achievements and results presented in the article were obtained based on research conducted among experts from the University of Pennsylvania (USA). The study considers aspects connected to the problems of implementing the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies and identifies the benefits and risks of their implementation for Society 5.0.</jats:p>

AB  - Industry 4.0 comprises an optimum mix of speed, flexibility, quality, technology, business efficiency and environmental efficiency which leads to a safer and secured future. The previous revolutions have all been designed on the idea of creating newer technologies and have thereby chanced upon editing the flaws which comes with creating but the newest Industry 4.0 deals with taking whatever technology is already present in the market and actively removing all the clutter associated with it which eventually makes this process an innovation through and through. In spite of innovating upon the base technology to build processes for a better industrial future, there are some problems which do not have a clear-cut solution and this is where Fuzzy mathematical modeling comes into play.
 Moreover, with talks of Industry 5.0 surfacing, which is considered as the age of robots, a robot is given clear cut instructions as to a manufacturing process even in an uncertain environment. Thus, the process is slightly modified; a fuzzy modeling will be capable of handling such imprecise situations.

AB  - This article presents an idea of achieving reliability through Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for industrial power systems. It proposes hybrid approach for predictive and corrective maintenance. It discusses the self-corrective maintenance (SCM) paradigm as hybrid approach for industrial power systems along with condition-based maintenance approach utilizing IIoT to achieve it. As it is well known that industries pay huge penalty for the down time, and suffer to meet reliability demands for years. Study witnesses its cost in millions of dollars yearly for production disruptions. It can be prevented by proactively following the aggressive maintenance schedule. However, it often becomes expensive as part or service may not be utilized for its full life and failure may occur even in middle of maintenance cycle. On the other hand, condition-based maintenance (CBM) helps utilize the full life and prevents the downtime by predicting the failures ahead. This article reviews current maintenance practices followed by industry leaders and a proposal on self-corrective maintenance based on condition of restorable resources. It is about learning the condition of subsystems by itself and taking corrective action when subsystem is not active. This concept helps reduce manual intervention to correct the problem as well as the maintenance cost. This research also covers the self-uncorrectable issues to be handled by proactively following CBM process through IIoT. This hybrid proposal could be a significant gear shift in maintenance direction for general industry as well as power systems. It can be termed as industry's 5th revolution or Industry 5.0.

AB  - <jats:p>The innovation driven Industry 5.0, in agreement with Industry 4.0, leads to consider human in a prominence position as the center of manufacturing field. This pushes towards the hybridization of manufacturing plants promoting a fully collaboration between human and robot. Furthermore, the new paradigm of &amp;quot;human centred design&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;anthropocentric design&amp;quot; allows enabling a synergistic combination of human and robot skills. However, properly collaborative workplaces are currently very few. Industry is still not confident, and systems integrators hesitate to venture into Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC). Despite the effort in collaborative robotics, a general solution to overcome the current limitations in designing of collaborative workplaces still misses. In the current work, a Knowledge-Based Approach (KBA) is adopted to face collaborative workplace designing problem. The framework resulting from the KBA allows developing a modelling paradigm that enable to define a streamlined approach for the layout designing of a collaborative workplace. Finally, a what-if analysis and a ANOVA analysis are performed to generate and evaluate a set of scenarios related to a collaborative workplace for quality inspection of welded parts. Facing the high complexity and multidisciplinary of HRC can be conveyed to develop a general design approach aimed at overcoming the difficulties that limit the spread of HRC in the manufacturing field.</jats:p>

AB  - Over the last decade, manufacturing processes have undergone significant change. Most factory activities have been transformed through a set of features built into a smart manufacturing framework. The tools brought to bear by the fourth industrial revolution are critical enablers of such change and progress. This review article describes the series of industrial revolutions and explores traditional manufacturing before presenting various enabling technologies. Insights are offered regarding traditional manufacturing lines where some enabling technologies have been included. The manufacturing supply chain is envisaged as enhancing the enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 through their integration. A systematic literature review is undertaken to evaluate each enabling technology and the manufacturing supply chain and to provide some theoretical synthesis. Similarly, obstacles are listed that must be overcome before a complete shift to smart manufacturing is possible. A brief discussion maps out how the fourth industrial revolution has led to novel manufacturing technologies. Likewise, a review of the fifth industrial revolution is given, and the justification for this development is presented.

AB  - Due to recent technology progress in areas such as IoT, AI, big data and robotics, Japanese industry is heading towards the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The industrial system is shifting from manufacturing worksite superiority to intelligence or software superiority in manufacturing. The government promotes these trends through its Society 5.0 initiative. Software superiority in manufacturing facilitates front loading; the conversion of skills to explicit knowledge makes progress in manufacturing processes through the use of IT and craftsmanship. This research deals with three cases. The first case is a company-developed system that’s scalable from customized products to standard products and that realizes diversified products via microscale production. The second case, focusing on the introduction of robots and a robot system integrator (SIer), is the keystone company within the SIer community; its business consists of robot engineering projects and FA educational system projects. The third case, metal 3D printing manufacturing, is invigorating. The company is the first service bureau in Japan that is capable of providing comprehensive services in the field of metal additive manufacturing (AM), handling everything from powder development and manufacture to prototyping and mass production needs. Clearly, IoT and the servitization of industry are the two wheels of a cart in industry, significantly transforming not only manufacturing sites but also business models. Although each case represents a different field of industry, each meets a unique and remarkable challenge in standardization, platform and ecosystem. In the digital age, IoT is an enabler and provides a background for transformation of business models. Through servitization, businesses can be the field for co-creation by feeding back the experience of learning-by-doing and reorganizing it. It is a powerful option for company to meet the challenge of service platform building.

AB  - <jats:p>For many applications deployed in manufacturing networks, communication latency has been a significant barrier. Despite the constant development of improved communication protocols and standards during Industry 4.0, the latency problem persists, lowering quality of services (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE). Tactile internet (TI), with its high availability, security, and ultra-low latency, will add a new dimension to human-machine interaction (HMI) by enabling haptic and tactile sensations. The tactile internet (TI) is a cutting-edge technology that uses 5G and beyond (B5G) communications to enable real-time interaction of haptic data over the internet between tactile ends. This emerging TI technology is regarded as the next evolutionary step for the Internet of Things (IoT) and is expected to bring about massive changes towards Society 5.0 and to address complex issues in current society. To that end, the 5G mobile communication systems will support the TI at the wireless edge. As a result, TI can be used as a backbone for delay mitigation in conjunction with 5G networks, allowing for ultra-reliable low latency applications like Smart Manufacturing, virtual reality, and augmented reality. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to present the current state of 5G and TI, as well as the challenges and future trends for 5G networks beyond 2021, as well as a conceptual framework for integrating 5G and TI into existing industrial case studies, with a focus on the design aspects and layers of TI, such as the master, network, and slave layers. Finally, the key publications focused on the key enabling technologies of TI are summarized and the beyond 5G era towards Society 5.0 based on cyber-physical systems is discussed.</jats:p>

AB  - This article integrates the concept of leap frogging strategy and digitalization as a key strategy for the sustainability of logistics players in facing up with GIG economy. At present, business organization are moving towards Industry 5.0 (internet of thought) and GIG economy where the traditional way of fully relying on full time workers are no longer relevant. The world of work is changing. From organizational view, leap frogging strategy with technological advancement are significant to achieve competitive advantage to ensure the continuity of business. While from worker perspective, having technology driven talent is a must to face new business economy called as GIG economy. In other words, all workers in every industry including logistics should ensure they have technology driven talent in his/her portfolio to remain competitive in the working world. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the applicability of Industry 5.0 such as digitalization and mobile marketing to logistics players; to make them more visible to customer and competitor. Single case study method was adopted to study on the perspective as discussed above more in-depth. Findings from this single case study is transferable as it provides rich explanation and discussion from one of the earliest logistics company in Malaysia, with logistics experience almost five (5) decades in providing logistics services. The qualitative findings pointed out four key areas for LSP improvement. Firstly, all LSPs should go for transition process with their business model to provide them with new revenue - logistics digital business and allow them to be more visible to their customer by fully utilizing the promotion activities online. Secondly, every agreement with customer should be put into contract and it is paperless within system. Thirdly, digital payment is a must to all logistics players to practice in order for them to compete in digital era. Finally, and inevitability, to sustain in the business, logistics may move to become intelligent logistics players with carrying no asset and just focus on negotiating contracts with customers. This term refers to practising logistics players with no assets or less assets centric. In principle, the company does not own asset but able to provide logistics services (for example fleet and warehouses) by aggregating â€œinformation about assetsâ€ from people who do own them by leveraging on data. This article contributes to the logistics study by matching issue on digitalization and GIG economy in logistics sector. More work on future of logistics is needed with large sample across the globe in order to obtain more data to help the logistics players depict themselves in new economy.

AB  - Due to COVID-19, many people turned their homes into temporary working or learning spaces. The format and experience of remote working and study have changed dramatically, especially for collaborative works. For remote collaboration, between the level of platform and tool, there is still a missing layer of product that can connect hybrid co-creation experience virtually and physically. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to assist and amplify the remote co-creation experience that bridges learning and collaboration between the tangible world and digital meetings by experimenting with designing the material and process of a remote co-creation workshop. The outcome is the redesign of remote co-creation experience, which enhances cross-disciplinary collaboration, diversifies the format and interaction of online collaboration, facilitates meaningful and efficient communication, extends the co-creation experience from online to offline, encapsulates its service into an education and co-creation learning toolkit—MAKE TO:GATHER, in order to make a positive and meaningful social impact.

AB  - Technological advances have made possible industrial and commercial applications of artificial intelligence, virtual reality and highly integrated manufacturing systems. It has also freed business activity from a focus on place, as both work activities and markets have been able to harness information and communication technologies in order to operate remotely. As a result, researchers have highlighted a phenomenon of ‘smart’ working. Some have pointed to a fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) in which ‘smart’ factories use robotics to achieve high performance. There is now a suggestion of progress towards Industry 5.0, in which technological and social systems work in harmony to deliver personalised mass customization of products and services. This paper examines these developments from the perspective of unique, individual understandings of work roles and sustainability, posing the questions ‘Smart’ from whose point of view? Do smart systems promote sustainable organizations? How should design of smart systems be approached? It suggests that contemporary socio-technical systems approaches to organizational analysis are the best way to support harnessing of smart technologies in organizations.

AB  - Abstract A commixture of gasphase compounds including carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and trace metals were collected at a site located at the urban/industrial interface in Houston, Texas. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis yielded nine factors: gas/crude oil (21.3±5.5%), isoprene emission (17.0±7.1%), Si-rich (14.6±1.3%), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) (11.2±4.0%), traffic (10.6±0.4%), Fluidized-bed Catalytic Cracking (FCC)/high temperature operations (7.2±4.3%), oil refinery (6.8±0.9%), soil and road dust (6.2±0.6%), and petrochemical industries (5.0±5.0%). Daytime and nighttime PMF runs were carried out to see potential differences among and within emission sources. Notable findings include: (1) Nocturnal isoprene emission was identified from traffic exhaust and industrial sources. (2) LPG emissions were higher during the day most likely due to temperature dependent evaporative processes. (3) V/Ni and SO2/V ratios reveal greater contribution from crude oil in the merged natural gas/crude oil emission factor. Corrosion might be responsible for emitting metals (i.e., Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni) from oil refineries during nighttime. (4) In the soil and road dust factor, metals relevant to plant physiological processes are mostly retained by the plants while the lanthanoids and other metals (i.e. Y, Pb, Mn, Ga, Ba) are more prone to physical removal during the day. (5) FCC/high temperature operations are dominated by metals at night. (6) The traffic factor increases during the day possibly due to the higher number of vehicles. Bivariate polar plots suggest the Houston Ship Channel area as the primary emission source for LPG, natural gas/crude oil, FCC/high temperature operations, and petrochemical industries.

AB  - <jats:p>At present in Europe and Russia there are active discussions of the next mega stage of human social and economic development. It concerns the Industry 5.0 concept. In 2020–2021 members of scientific research and technological organizations discussed the aspects of Industry 5.0 at a number of well-known European and Russian forums. Major attention was paid to technologies maintaining Industry 5.0. As a result the world scientific community reached a consensus on two fronts: firstly, on integration of opportunities of the existing technologies of Industry 4.0 with the human-oriented approach of Industry 5.0 which will give way to harmonious interaction of human intelligence with cognitive calculations; and, secondly, on integration of human and machine intelligence to create collective intelligence which will make it possible to avoid technological singularity in future as well as provide for simultaneous humans’ evolution and technologies’ development. These will become the basis for creating a fundamentally new social, economic and cultural strategy of the society’s development for the coming decades. The strategy is based on applying collective intelligence and meta-system technologies in all spheres of life. For the first time in the world scientific practice the authors introduce the concept of Industry 5.0 as a cyber social system which allows the alliance of human and artificial intelligence aimed at creating collective super intelligence and becomes a source of harmonious technological development of human civilization. The authors present a neuro-ecosystem model of Industry 5.0 concept which will make it possible to set the task of implementing the systems of global meta-system strategized development of cognitive production and industry. Such systems are established as part of organization of cognitive production and new types of social and economic, cyber-social and industrial ecosystems by means of implementing collective intelligence and neuro-digital meta-technologies. This is the first stage of a new evolution process of developing Industry 4.0 concept, transition to Industry 5.0 and to meta-system transformations economics.</jats:p>

AB  - The use of advanced technologies has increased drastically to maintain any sensitive records related to education, health, or finance. It helps to protect the data from unauthorized access by attackers. However, all the existing advanced technologies face some issues because of their uncertainties. These technologies have some lapses to provide privacy, attack-free, transparency, reliability, and flexibility. These characteristics are essential while managing any sensitive data like educational certificates or medical certificates. Hence, we designed an Industry 5.0 based blockchain application to manage medical certificates using Remix Ethereum blockchain in this paper. This application also employs a distributed application (DApp) that uses a test RPC-based Ethereum blockchain and user expert system as a knowledge agent. The main strength of this work is the maintenance of existing certificates over a blockchain with the creation of new certificates that use logistic Map encryption cipher on existing medical certificates while uploading into the blockchain. This application helps to quickly analyze the birth, death, and sick rate as per certain features like location and year.

AB  - Abstract According to many, we are at the brink of the fourth industrial revolution. The theme of Industry 4.0 is "Smart Manufacturing for the Future". Now, some futurists even discuss what the fifth industrial revolution’s theme will be. There are a few visions for Industry 5.0. One emerging theme is human-robot co-working. In recent years, we have seen significant advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) research. Today, there are robots for various purposes at affordable prices in the market. It is not long before we closely interact with robots in our lives and workplaces. Testing autonomous cars in traffic is a promising example of this upcoming trend. There are companies having an employee record for robots or AI applications. While there are many studies on human-robot collaboration for low-level tasks with a focus on robot development, we lack studies focusing on organizational issues emerging from human-robot co-working. In this study, we discuss the possible issues related to human-robot co-working from the organizational and human employee’s perspective. We believe the issues identified in this study will be the focus of many upcoming organizational robotics research studies.

AB  - Industry 4.0 have witnessed a paradigm shift from cyber-physical systems (CPS) that aims at massive automation, towards a more customer-driven approach. The shift has been attributed to the design of hyper-cognitive systems, integration of virtual and extended reality, digital machinery prototyping and twin designs, trusted machine boundaries, collaborative robots, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based supply chains. This new wave, termed Industry 5.0, is expected to leverage massive production with user-centric customization outside the scope of Industry 4.0 ecosystems. Industry 5.0 is expected to assist diverse industrial verticals like healthcare, smart farming, drones, smart grids, and supply chain production ecosystems. However, data is shared among multiple heterogeneous networks, spanning different authoritative domains. Thus, trusted and secured data transfer is crucial to synergize and secure the industrial perimeters. Blockchain (BC) is a preferred choice as a security enabler to Industry 5.0 ecosystems owing to its inherent property of immutability, chronology, and auditability in industrial systems. Limited works are proposed that present the vision and holistic view of BC-assisted Industry 5.0 applications. The article presents a first-of-its-kind survey on BC as a security enabler in Industry 5.0. Based on a descriptive survey methodology and research questions, we presented the key drivers, and potential applications, and propose an architectural vision of BC-based Industry 5.0 in diverse applicative verticals. The survey intends to present solutions that would assist industry practitioners, academicians, and researchers to drive novel BC-assisted solutions in Industry 5.0 verticals.

AB  - This paper proposes a new invention creation method using patent classification information. Currently, innovation in nearly every field is being generated by the spread of information technology such as IoT and ICT. In Japan, major changes are expected in the country's economic and social structure with the emergence of the "hyper-smart society" (Society 5.0) in the not-so-distant future. In this context, promoting technology-led new inventions in a way that avoids overlapping investment and duplicate research will be essential. In this paper, we propose a method to capture trends in innovation by taking advantage of the information available in Japan's F-term classification system. Uniquely, the F-term system uses a meta-classification structure, with classification tables for each technology unit, identified by "theme code." By using multiple theme codes, including those for informationrelated technologies, it is possible to compare various technologies. Classification tables are indicators of the current common technical knowledge. These can be a source leading to the creation of new inventions by allowing innovators to identify viewpoints that have not already been explored. Discovering a new invention can also lead to a promising inventive next step. From the result of the analysis, our proposed method of the Fterm classification system to foster new inventions related to information technology is effective for capturing the technology trend.

AB  - <jats:p>The increasing skill mismatch in manufacturing workforce is raising demand for training opportunities to cope with advanced manufacturing systems. To maintain production and adjust quickly to technological transformation, innovative work-based learning approaches are emphasized. Intelligent machines are becoming capable of interaction and collaboration with humans. They not only introduce a new type of learnable workforce to manufacturing but may open opportunities to enhance learning of all learners. Symbiotic relationships of humans and machines have wide potential for human-centric manufacturing (aka Industry 5.0). Moreover, connecting smart devices and deploying self-learning solutions is envisioned to increase flexibility of manufacturing, thus changing work division between humans and machines. Where humans and machines collaborate, the term Reciprocal Learning has been coined to describe the process of bidirectional learning. While a definition of Reciprocal Learning exists the boundary conditions of the concept are still ambiguous. In this paper, a framework for Reciprocal Learning in Human-Machine Collaboration for Industry 5.0 is presented to clarify what it is and what it isn’t. The approach is based on a multi-agent system perspective, comprising human and machine agents. Finally, an outlook on future research is presented.</jats:p>

AB  - Human Factor strategy and management have been affected by the incorporation of Key Enabling Technologies (KETs) of industry 4.0, whereby operator 4.0 has been configured to address the wide variety of cooperative activities and to support skills that operate in VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous) environments under the interaction with ubiquitous interfaces on real and virtual hybrid environments of cyber-physical systems. Current human Competences-Capacities that are supported by the technological enablers could result in a radically disempowered human factor. This means that in the processes of optimization and improvement of manufacturing systems from industry 4.0 to industry 5.0, it would be necessary to establish strategies for the empowerment of the human factor, which constitute symbiotic and co-evolutionary socio-technical systems through talent, sustainability, and innovation. This paper establishes a new framework for the design and development of occupational environments 5.0 for the inclusion of singularized operators 4.0, such as individuals with special capacities and talents. A case study for workers and their inclusion in employment is proposed. This model integrates intelligent and inclusive digital solutions in the current workspaces of organizations under digital transformation.

AB  - Rapid advances in technology have spurred tremendous progress in developing the next generation of Industry 4.0 that was initially introduced in 2011 as a German strategic initiative for revolutionizing the manufacturing sector. Ten years have passed since 2011. In these ten years, numerous new and promising technologies and applications have been developed. The original concept of Industry 4.0, including the conceptual framework, technology framework, and enabling technologies, has experienced tremendous changes. As such, the new generation of Industry 4.0 emerges, which is also called Industry 5.0. Today, we are on the cusp of the Industry 4.0 evolution supported by a new set of enabling technologies. In such evolution of Industry 4.0, future Industry 4.0 requires a combination of recently emerging new technologies, which is giving rise to the emergence of the next generation of Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. Such technologies originate from different disciplines, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), 5G/6G, Quantum Computing, and others. The technologies in the original Industry 4.0 framework, such as Cyber-Physical Systems, IoT, etc., will be affected by Artificial Intelligence (AI), 5G/6G, and Quantum Computing. At this present moment, the emergence of a new era of Industry 4.0 can be seen. In this paper, we briefly survey the main emerging enabling technologies in Industry 4.0 as it relates to industries.

AB  - <jats:p>Technological digitalization and the capabilities of artificial intelligence are among the main tools recommended to companies to overcome the negative consequences of the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. And this is true not only for companies in the high-tech sector, but also for those who are part of the supply chains of natural resources such as natural gas. Moreover, in addition to the flexibility of technological solutions, natural gas supply companies are expected to protect their place in the renewable / regenerative / economy, which defines natural gas as one of the clean energy sources. To meet these challenges, the article examines how and in what way the ongoing global crisis provoked by the COVID 19 pandemic is slowing down the processes of technological digitalization and integration of business processes in gas supply companies, i.e., to what extent these companies have "walked the path" of the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0. We are looking for answers to these questions on the basis of an empirical study conducted in gas companies, showing the change in the level of technological innovation, the development of linkages between individual business processes, and the place of artificial intelligence in their overall activities.</jats:p>

AB  - This study provides a holistic view of the acceptance of collaborative robots (cobots) in the manufacturing context by adopting the socio-technical perspective to the Industry 5.0 era. Grounding on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Socio-Technical Systems theory (STS), this study proposes a conceptual model to better understanding critical factors that influence the acceptance of cobots and how these factors can drive perceived work performance improvement in the organizational level. This study was conducted by catching the critical issue, reviewing the literature on the subject of this study, identifying previous research gaps, and subsequently developing constructs of the model. As a result, this study offers valuable contributions to robotics and manufacturing literature and further suggests empirical research to generally examine and validate the conceptual model.

AB  - <jats:p>Modern-day agriculture supply chains have evolved from sovereign and autonomous local stakeholders to a worldwide interconnected system of multiple participants linked by complicated interactions, impacting the production, processing, transportation, and delivery of food to end consumers. Regular instances of fraudulent acts reveal a lack of openness in agriculture supply chains, raising worries about financial losses, eroding customer trust, and lowering corporate brand value. To develop an efficient and reliable trading environment, several fundamental modifications in the present supply chain architecture are required. There is broad consensus that blockchain can improve transparency in agriculture-food supply chains (agri-food SCs). Consumers now demand safe, sustainable, and equitable food production processes, and businesses are using blockchains and the internet of things to meet these needs. For enhanced responsiveness in agri-food SCs, new concepts have evolved that combine blockchains with various Industry 5.0 technologies (e.g., blockchain technology, big data, internet of things (IoT), radio frequency identification (RFID), near field communication (NFC), etc.). It is critical to cut through the hype and examine the technology’s limits, which might stymie its acceptance, implementation, and scalability in agri-food supply chains. This study presents Agri-SCM-BIoT (Agriculture Supply Chain Management using Blockchain and Internet of things) architecture to address the storage and scalability optimization, interoperability, security and privacy issues security, and privacy of personal data along with storage concerns with present single-chain agriculture supply chain systems. We also discussed the classification of security threats with IoT infrastructure and possible available blockchain-based defense mechanisms. Finally, we discussed the features of the proposed supply chain architecture, followed by a conclusion and future work.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>The erratic modern world introduces challenges to all sectors of societies and potentially introduces additional inequality. One possibility to decrease the educational inequality is to provide remote access to facilities that enable learning and training. A similar approach of remote resource usage can be utilized in resource-poor situations where the required equipment is available at other premises. The concept of Industry 5.0 (i5.0) focuses on a human-centric approach, enabling technologies to concentrate on human–machine interaction and emphasizing the importance of societal values. This paper introduces a novel robotics teleoperation platform supported by the i5.0. The platform reduces inequality and allows usage and learning of robotics remotely independently of time and location. The platform is based on digital twins with bi-directional data transmission between the physical and digital counterparts. The proposed system allows teleoperation, remote programming, and near real-time monitoring of controlled robots, robot time scheduling, and social interaction between users. The system design and implementation are described in detail, followed by experimental results.</jats:p>

AB  - Along with the increasing development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), there has been a change in the learning approach method. Methods of face-to-face learning (conventional) and classrooms as implementation have now changed. The ilearning method approach has turned into the direction of future learning or as a learning age of knowledge. In the world of education, information becomes a vital need to support teaching and learning activities. In the online learning system that applied to iLearning+ information needs become critical needs therein. But in reality, the delivery of information is not done online, but with current information such as the delivery of information is done in an intermediary between lecturers and students, which must be done face to face so get a piece of information. So in that event, a system is needed to be able to convey information with a Web-based system so that delivery can be done online and can be accessed anytime and anywhere without being limited by time and space. In this study, using the literature review research method as a comparison material on existing research.

AB  - <jats:p>A global transformation from Industry 4.0 towards Industry 5.0 will soon take place. Such transformations are intrinsic to human and sustainable value creation. An increasing number of companies, recognising this imminent trend, will need to transform their current classical, solely profit-oriented business models into sustainable business models that also target human, social, and environmental aspects. Various frameworks already exist that support the design of sustainable business models. Practical applications of these frameworks and research on the transformation process in the production domain, which places a special focus on small and medium enterprises, is still scarce. This paper presents the first results from a sustainable business model transformation project on a European SME, which produces 3D printers. The research method applies a single case study design. The study was based on publicly available information and qualitative data, obtained through interviews and workshops carried out on an executive management level.</jats:p>

AB  - This chapter depicts an overall understanding of the first and second revolution transition in history from 1760s–1914s. The First Industrial Revolution started in the mid-17th century where mechanical facilities were introduced to the world. For instance, steam and powered machines were developed to ease workers in the mass goods production, enhancing the production efficiency and scale. The first revolution also be noted as the beginning of the industry culture in which small businesses grew from serving a limited number of customers to a large organization with thousands of employees. Subsequently followed by Industrial Revolution 2.0 that began at 1870s, the main contribution has shifted to the development of electrical machines. This era is also known as an evolution of Industry 1.0 where the industry culture was introduced into the management system. Many production management techniques such as labor division, timely manufacturing, and lean manufacturing principles were discovered to improve the quality and quantity of the products.

AB  - In Industry 5.0 paradigm, AI-based systems are the essential component for the Internet of Things. In most applications, Industry 5.0 showed a significant connection between intelligent systems and humans through accurate manufacturing automation with critical thinking skills. Also, Industry 5.0 brings several competent tools that help organizations work inexpensively and instantly change without any principal investment. In recent years, smart devices, wireless communication, and sensor nodes have made considerable advances, making the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of interconnected, Internet-connected devices that can capture and transmit data without the need for human interaction over a wireless network. With the introduction of IoT, human beings take some relaxed and unburden feelings. IoT devices enable users to obtain information even in rural surroundings and prepare reports without restrictions. In addition, they accurately guide human beings with intelligent judgments via communication, as mentioned earlier, technologies. Numerous connected devices collect a considerable quantity of raw sensed data, where it needs pre-processing. However, only it turns into something valuable because of IoT devices’ adequate resources entailed to edge computing. Artificial intelligence-based algorithms are the necessary means for information inference in edge computing. Besides, the sensed data accumulated from IoT applications are generally unstructured and need further analysis, where AI-based models help extract relevant information.Furthermore, transmitting data from device to device, there is a chance for malicious attacks. Hence, this chapter explores Industry 5.0, IoT architecture, and AI-based IoT; we analyze IoT network’s technical details; communication enables technologies. Then we discussed various AI-based technologies integrated into IoT, AI-based tools, edge computing, and trust models for IoT appliances.

AB  - <jats:p>The human-centered design (HCD) approach places humans at the center of design in order to improve both products and processes, and to give users an effective, efficient and satisfying interactive experience. In industrial design and engineering, HCD is very useful in helping to achieve the novel Industry 5.0 concept, based on improving workers’ wellbeing by providing prosperity beyond jobs and growth, while respecting the production limits of the planet as recently promoted by the European Commission. In this context, the paper proposes an ergonomic assessment method based on the analysis of the workers’ workload to support the design of industrial products and processes. This allows the simultaneous analysis of the physical and cognitive workload of operators while performing their tasks during their shift. The method uses a minimum set of non-invasive wearable devices to monitor human activity and physiological parameters, in addition to questionnaires for subjective self-assessment. The method has been preliminarily tested on a real industrial case in order to demonstrate how it can help companies to support the design of optimized products and processes promoting the workers’ wellbeing.</jats:p>

AB  - A true artificial intelligence (AI) system is something that "learns" from the data it stores,  in order to perform tasks and solve problems that typically require human intelligence - either with the help of a human expert or independently. The area of AI is an interdisciplinary field, which has been designated as a strategic area in the European Union (EU) approach and a key driver of economic development that can bring solutions to many social challenges and problems. Due to its nature and its tendency to be digitally advanced and smarter with analytics, the financial sector is one of the early adopters of AI and expects multiple benefits from its application, that is, the ability to provide better service in the shortest time possible and at a lower cost. AI in the financial sector is based on an understanding of the business needs of financial organizations, institutions and markets and the ability to connect with technological capabilities. They are powerful tools that completely transform this sector. The basic idea of this paper is to consider where the real value of AI in the financial sector is, i.e. what are the practical aspects and business implications of AI in the financial sector globally. It is common knowledge that evolving technologies have always had a strong impact on the sectors in which they are applied because they give them the opportunity to improve existing manufacturing processes, services, customer experiences, operate more efficiently, achieve cost savings, etc. The aim of this paper is to identify areas of application of AI in the financial sector, and to explore leading AI applications that are changing the financial ecosystem, transforming the financial sector and that have the potential to significantly improve many of its functions. The paper further highlights other implications of AI implementation in the financial sector such as employment - job creation and termination of existing AI-influenced employment, the scope and potential of application in developing countries, the problem of regulation and use in the best interests of man, and the importance of properly managing specific AI risks.

AB  - Abstract Industry 4.0, an initiative from Germany, has become a globally adopted term in the past decade. Many countries have introduced similar strategic initiatives, and a considerable research effort has been spent on developing and implementing some of the Industry 4.0 technologies. At the ten-year mark of the introduction of Industry 4.0, the European Commission announced Industry 5.0. Industry 4.0 is considered to be technology-driven, whereas Industry 5.0 is value-driven. The co-existence of two Industrial Revolutions invites questions and hence demands discussions and clarifications. We have elected to use five of these questions to structure our arguments and tried to be unbiased for the selection of the sources of information and for the discussions around the key issues. It is our intention that this article will spark and encourage continued debate and discussion around these topics.

AB  - We increasingly live simultaneously immersed in physical interactions and in a world where the digital dimension is present at various levels, such as the social, economic and political ones. In this context, the relationship between the digital world and Sustainability is pivotal. This aim of this paper is to discuss, in a reasoned manner, the importance of literacy in the promotion of sustainability in a digital society. For this purpose, the results of a literature review will be mobilized, as well as our 20 years of experience in teaching and research in the fields of sociology, education and organizations, without forgetting the publications that we have on similar topics, which will be, whenever heuristically relevant, mobilized to substantiate and justify the arguments presented herein. The conclusions show that, in a reality where the digital involves many of the life dimensions—for example, in the form of Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0—the role of literacy and, in particular, digital literacy, are critical in the development of sustainability literacy. For this to be possible, significant training work must be carried out. Furthermore, it is not possible to assume that the access, the skills in its use and the benefits of this wonderful digital world will automatically be grasped and felt by all citizens, in an ideology that must be fought. Only in this way will it be possible to foster sustainability, which must necessarily be inclusive.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a cost-effective method to support the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and is an enabling technology for Industry 5.0. The use of RFID is particularly suited to IIoT as it does not require a line of sight for communication and can be retroactively affixed to non-smart items. However, RFID communication is affected by the properties of the material the tag is affixed to, specifically the material permittivity. Metal is commonly present in smart factory environments and supply chains and impedes RFID communication. A suitable tag design is required to accommodate these challenges and ensure resilience for Industry 5.0 applications. The research presented in this paper has assessed the communication performance of RFID antenna designs with and without metal present beneath the tag. The RFID tag designs that performed reliably in the simulation were manufactured, and their read range was tested on materials of varying relative permittivity and thickness to represent MP and NMP scenarios. The results have verified the robustness of “Cyber” to “Physical” designs and provide recommendations to support practitioner IIoT tag selection.

AB  - <jats:p>Ethno-STEM to Reduce the Phenomenon of Saturation and Develop Student Entrepreneurial Character Society 5.0 is a human-centered and technology-based concept that integrates virtual and physical spaces through a system. The world of education must continue to innovate. Islamic boarding schools are educational institutions that combine religious learning with general education to instill intelligence, skills, good character, and moral values in students without drifting away from Islamic values. The 24-hour learning system is a source of student learning saturation. The approach used in carrying out active learning and fostering learning motivation is Ethno-STEM. A systematic literature review was conducted by documenting and reviewing all articles related to active learning for increasing learning motivation that were published in national and international accredited journals between 2018 and 2021, accessed from Science Direct, Google Scholar, SINTA, DOAJ, and lens.org. The results showed that the Ethno-STEM approach can effectively increase students’ learning motivation through active learning that stimulates students to improve their thinking skills, especially the critical, creative, innovative, and entrepreneurial characters.&#x0D;

AB  - In recent years manufacturing and assembly lines are undergoing workplace changes with a scope to adapt to the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) design principles. Automation of manufacturing, collaborative robots (cobots), interconnection of cyber physical systems (CPS), cloud computing, big data analytics and Augmented/Virtual reality (AR/VR) are some of the technologies that are being introduced in industry. Human operators are required to adapt and integrate into those new environments. Human operators should be flexible in their work-tasks, upgrade their skillset and be able to act as a safeguard entity in this complex and dynamic environment. A recent shift in paradigms, the Industry 5.0 concept, focus on the sustainability of the human factor inside the technologies that I4.0 framework introduced, and relates to the ageing workforce issue and the change in individuals’ capabilities. Productivity and safety of the ageing operators in the new workplace environment is causally related to their capabilities. In this research paper, we (i) study the interactions of human operator inside the “smart” workplace and (ii) develop a model using the entropy concept of statistical mechanics. This model can be utilized in the evaluation of human factor inside the complex environment by computing the probability of error based on human operator capabilities.

AB  - <jats:p>In the era of Industry 4.0, manufacturing and production systems were revolutionized by increasing operational efficiency and developing and implementing new business models, services, and products. Concretely, the milestone set for Industry 4.0 was to improve the sustainability and efficiency of production systems. By extension, the emphasis was focused on both the digitization and the digitalization of systems, providing room for further improvement. However, the current technological evolution is more system/machine-oriented, rather than human-oriented. Thus, several countries have begun orchestrating initiatives towards the design and development of the human-centric aspect of technologies, systems, and services, which has been coined as Industry 5.0. The impact of Industry 5.0 will extend to societal transformation, which eventually leads to the generation of a new society, the Society 5.0. The developments will be focused on the social and human-centric aspect of the tools and technologies introduced under the framework of Industry 4.0. Therefore, sustainability and human well-being will be at the heart of what comes next, the Industry 5.0, as a subset of Society 5.0. Industry 5.0 will build on the foundations laid during Industry 4.0 by emphasizing human-centered, resilient, and sustainable design. Consequently, the authors in this research work, through a critical literature review, aim to provide adequate reasoning for considering Industry 5.0 as a framework for enabling the coexistence of industry and emerging societal trends and needs. The contribution of this research work extends to the provision of a framework to facilitate the transition from Industry 4.0 to Society 5.0.</jats:p>

AB  - The fourth industrial revolution carries with it various expectations for the future of sustainable and effective development. Industry 4.0 takes a significant part of everyday life. There is no way. The application of digital life on smart phones, touch screens and smart classrooms may be significant indicators of this. Not just computer information and life but also human-like robotics would take a long time. In the immediate future, you will also see the picture of a modern 5.0 model for manufacturing. Since of emerging technology and increasingly evolving and increasing AI-based approaches, remaining on the top is getting more and more challenging. Robots are much more relevant as now the brain-machine’s technology can be merged with the human mind, as artificial intelligence advances. There are coercive problems in the world economy because efficiency is to be improved without the human workforce being robbed of the manufacturing sector. This paper presents the idea of sustainable business 5.0, where machines are intertwined with the human brain and function as partners rather than rivals, against these obstacles. In addition, the effect of Industry 5.0, which is more likely to create more jobs than to reduce, will be discussed on manufacturing and the economy as a whole. The paper describes modern technology, from IoT to news. Thanks to our view, the integration of these innovations would turn industry 4.0 into industry 5.0.

AB  - OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to determine the variation in intrapleural pressure (IPP) with and without air leakage using a digital chest drainage system (DCS) for each pressure setting. METHODS In this retrospective single-centre study, we analysed 49,553 h of air leakage after anatomical lung resection in 714 patients between 2018 and 2020. The transition of mean IPP and mean air leak flow was monitored using DCS, and the association between mean IPP and mean air leak flow was examined. The relationship between the transition of mean IPP and air leakage according to the varying suction pressures on DCS was also investigated. RESULTS Overall, 272 patients (38.1%) showed air leakage after surgery. The mean IPP in patients without air leakage was -12.0 ± 2.9 cmH2O and maintained at about -12 cmH2O constantly, while the mean IPP in patients with air leakage was -8.3 ± 1.9 cmH2O, which changed to -12 cmH2O instantly if air leakage disappeared (P < 0.001). Among patients with air leakage, the mean IPP changed more distinctly in patients with mild suction management than in those with conventional suction management (-5.0 ± 2.6 to -11.5 ± 4.2 and -8.8 ± 1.3 to -12.1 ± 2.5 cmH2O, respectively; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The change in IPP on a DCS is useful for detecting air leakage. Furthermore, management with a mild suction setting on DCS makes it easy to recognize the disappearance of postoperative air leakage.

AB  - The coffee plant, with more than 40 billion shrubs, 9 million tons of grains produced, and 80% of its production accounted for by small-scale producers, has been severely damaged since the emergence of <i>Hemileia vastatrix</i> and <i>Hypothenemus hampei</i>. Despite technological support, these pests have caused 20% to 40% production losses, a 50% to 60% deficit in performance, and a cost of between USD 70 million and USD 220 million to the world economies, which forces us to rethink actions centered on people as the key elements to develop appropriate solutions. For this, the present study presents a technological proposal centered on small indigenous coffee producer requirements for introducing Industry 5.0 technologies, considering roadmapping, knowledge management, statistical analysis, and the social, productive, and digital contexts of five localities in Mexico. The results show a correlation between monitoring and control, soil analysis, the creation of organic fertilizers, accompaniment, and coffee experimentation, as the actions to be implemented, proposing the introduction of a mobile application; sensors, virtual platforms, dome-shaped greenhouses, and spectrophotometric technology as relevant technologies centered on indigenous coffee producers' requirements. This study is important for policymakers, academics, and producers who wish to develop strategies centered on people in Mexico and the world.

AB  - Current research on smart contracts focuses on technical, conceptual, and legal aspects but neglects organizational requirements and sustainability impacts. We consider this a significant research gap and explore the relationship between smart contracts and sustainability in supply chains. First, we define the concept of smart contracts in terms of supply chain management. Then, we conduct a content analysis of the literature to explore the overlapping research fields of smart contracts and sustainability in supply chains. Next, we develop a semi-structured assessment framework to model the potential environmental and social impacts induced by smart contracts on supply chains. We propose a conceptual framework for supply chain maturity by mapping the relationships between organizational development, sustainability, and technology. We identify smart contracts as a foundational technology that enables efficient and transparent governance and collaborative self-coordination of human and non-human actors. Thus, we argue that smart contracts can contribute to the economic and social development of networked value chains and Society 5.0. To stimulate interdisciplinary research on smart contracts, we conclude the article by formulating research propositions and trade-offs for smart contracts in the context of technology development, business process and supply chain management, and sustainability.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) can help to pave the way to the circular economy and to a more sustainable world by enabling the digitalization of many operations and processes, such as water distribution, preventive maintenance, or smart manufacturing. Paradoxically, IoT technologies and paradigms such as edge computing, although they have a huge potential for the digital transition towards sustainability, they are not yet contributing to the sustainable development of the IoT sector itself. In fact, such a sector has a significant carbon footprint due to the use of scarce raw materials and its energy consumption in manufacturing, operating, and recycling processes. To tackle these issues, the Green IoT (G-IoT) paradigm has emerged as a research area to reduce such carbon footprint; however, its sustainable vision collides directly with the advent of Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI), which imposes the consumption of additional energy. This article deals with this problem by exploring the different aspects that impact the design and development of Edge-AI G-IoT systems. Moreover, it presents a practical Industry 5.0 use case that illustrates the different concepts analyzed throughout the article. Specifically, the proposed scenario consists in an Industry 5.0 smart workshop that looks for improving operator safety and operation tracking. Such an application case makes use of a mist computing architecture composed of AI-enabled IoT nodes. After describing the application case, it is evaluated its energy consumption and it is analyzed the impact on the carbon footprint that it may have on different countries. Overall, this article provides guidelines that will help future developers to face the challenges that will arise when creating the next generation of Edge-AI G-IoT systems.

AB  - To conduct, in an effective way, the non-destructive testing (NDT) of products—in particular, the fluorescent penetrant inspection (FPI)—remains a challenge. Therefore, the aim of this work is to propose the method of support in the choice of a fluorescent penetrant to be used in FPI research. In the results of the usage of the proposed procedure, it is demonstrated that it is possible to reduce the negative impacts on the environment by FPI processes (through sustainability), while including other criteria, i.e., financial, security, productive (Industry 4.0), and societal (Society 5.0) criteria. The essence of the proposed method is to integrate two methods of decision support. These were the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method and the cost–quality analysis (AKJ). Using the AHP method, the quality level of fluorescent penetrant (to the satisfaction of the customer)—which included the sustainability criteria—are calculated. These criteria include natural environment, reactivity, combustibility, level of sensitivity, and type of washing (emulsification). Then, with the help of the AKJ, the most favorable penetrant—in terms of quality and cost—is calculated and, thus, indicated. This choice must include the concept of sustainable development. Therefore, this method can be used to choose fluorescent penetrants in manufacturing and service enterprises which carry out FPI.

AB  - Given that the first, second, and third industrial revolutions might be defined by their radical impact on productivity, and that the productivity gains promised by the 'fourth industrial revolution' have largely failed to materialise in the productivity statistics, particularly in total factor productivity, this article discuses certain theory that predicts the next radical increase in productivity, and that suggests ways to enable it. In doing so, a proposed research agenda is made explicit, with the goal of reversing the set of global declining trends in productivity growth, research productivity, and the failure of emergent technologies to contribute to these forms of productivity. The goal of this proposed research agenda is to uncover and predict the source of the next radical increase in productivity, and given its importance, this research agenda is taken to relate to what might be usefully called the 'fifth industrial revolution'.

AB  - The main purpose of this paper is to present what the Industry 5.0 phenomenon means in the supply chain context. A systematic literature review method was used to get evidence from the current knowledge linked to this theme. The results have evidenced a strong gap related to Industry 5.0 approaches for the supply chain field. Forty-one (41) publications, including conference and journal papers, have been found in the literature. Nineteen (19) words, which were grouped in four (4) clusters, have been identified in the data analysis. This was the basis to form the four (4) constructs of Industry 5.0: Industry Strategy, Innovation and Technologies, Society and Sustainability, and Transition Issues. Then, an alignment with the supply chain context was proposed, being the basis for the incipient Supply Chain 5.0 framework and its research agenda. Industry 5.0 is still in an embryonic and ideal stage. The literature is scarce and many other concepts and discoveries are going to emerge. Although this literature review is based on few available sources, it provides insightful and novel concepts related to Industry 5.0 in the supply chain context. Moreover, it presents a clear set of constructs and a structured research agenda to encourage researchers in deploying further conceptual and empirical works linked to the subject herein explored. Organizations’ leadership, policymakers, and other practitioners involved in supply chains, and mainly those currently working with Industry 4.0 initiatives, can benefit from this research by having clear guidance regarding the dimensions needed to structurally design and implement an Industry 5.0 strategy. This article adds valuable insights to researchers and practitioners, by approaching the newest and revolutionary concept of the Industry 5.0 phenomenon in the supply chain context, which is still an unexplored theme.

AB  - Industry 5.0 has laid the necessity to relocate the human at the center of the manufacturing cycle, where everything should be designed to ease his/her work. This implies one to redefine the human-robot collaboration, making it not only safe, but also more inclusive for the operator. Nowadays, this goal is viable thanks to the integration of new sensors in the work cell. Coupled with advanced control strategies, they give the robot a better understanding of both the surrounding environment and the human movement, allowing a more organic cooperation. This paper exploits an RGBD camera and Deep Learning algorithms to retrieve the 3D positions of the manipulated objects in the workspace and to infer the most likely future human destinations in a pick and place case study. Merging this information, a proper control logic is defined and tested in a real robotics application, with the final intent of minimizing human-robot collisions during the collaboration and making the process more reliable and efficient.

AB  - This article provides a review about how uncertainties in increasingly complex production and supply chains should be addressed in scheduling tasks. Uncertainty management will be particularly important in Industry 5.0 solutions that will require the close integration of operators and technical systems. To prepare for these challenging developments, this work reviews the sources of uncertainty and the scheduling algorithms that deal with the different types of models developed to handle the uncertain nature of the elements and the environment of complex technological systems. The paper not only identifies the challenges, but also the main building blocks that can help to manage and reduce uncertainties based on the I4.0 and I5.0 solutions. We hope that this study will serve as a starting point for R&#x0026;D projects and algorithm developments, which will be needed primarily in the field of multi-agent, multistage and inverse optimizations.

AB  - <jats:p>This work arises as a reflection on what it means to be a designer of the future and their greater need for influence and collaboration with the team throughout the product creation cycle. The renewal of a culture of design and business innovation in the area of fashion and textile design is based on the establishment of bridges with different realities that, increasingly dynamic, change the landscape of different products and their creation processes, blurring the boundaries and limits of each area of intervention and its actors. From the small to the big industry we find new needs and professions that project themselves into the future reaching from the past, as in the case of new craft productions that value the identity, artistic and cultural heritage of each geography, supported by new materials and technologies of Industry 5.0. This new dynamic of integrated work, where everyone contributes to enhance the knowledge of each participant, enabling the renewal of knowledge and the development of innovation and social, cultural, and economic inclusion, needs greater support and connection between academia and the creative and productive reality on the ground. The present research group, sustained by the interpretation of the paths of work innovation in the coming decades, intended to provide a contribution to the industry and the culture of national or international design innovation, through research based on the identification of the knowledge and skills necessary for the future training of fashion designers.The adoption of a qualitative and quantitative methodology should allow the collection of data that can indicate trends of needs of future designers and the need to adapt the academy to these new realities. With this study we intend to establish a network of relationships between the different actors in the process of creation and innovation, as well as promote a greater connection between the different forms of creation and production that allow to satisfy the final consumer and their needs around fashion and textiles.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Various sectors of the built environment (BE) are threatened by deterioration processes that have an increasing trend due to ageing infrastructure, current extreme climatic conditions, increasing urban population, and limited financial resources [1]. Digitalization has the potential to transform the current processes of managing and sharing critical information that can enhance decision-making and, in the long term, enable efficient and sustainable BE. However, despite the recent technological advancements, BE, and particularly critical infrastructure systems are still managed following a traditional approach in both technological but also organizational, and institutional aspects. As a result, they do not take full advantage of the recent technological developments that can enable a more sophisticated approach that involves the incorporation of real-time data streams and the employment of advanced analytical methods for efficient management of resources and risks. To overcome this challenge, the utilization of technologies and advancements provided by Civil Infrastructure 4.0 (CI4.0) [2] accelerate the digitalization of the BE focusing on critical infrastructure systems.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This study focuses on providing an overview of the pillars for the next generation BE, which aims to enable an interconnected and collaborative ecosystem across cities, infrastructure, and societies. Various case studies are presented, including large residential regions, transportation networks across waterways, and buildings in which digitalization can play a pivotal role in providing instantly information to the BE stakeholders for enhanced decision-making. These are based on obtaining real-time data from the surrounding environment to assist in predicting the current and future states of BE. For example, obtained information derived from advanced microcontrollers measure the deteriorating performance of the ageing infrastructure systems over waterways and the flood levels in real-time. At the same time, datasets are incorporated into a high-performance machine hosted in cloud and deep-learning algorithms to predict the upcoming states of the infrastructure and climatic risk. In the case of an emergency state (e.g., river overflow, flash floods, or infrastructure disruption), the management system generates an alarm. At the same time, the models also predict infrastructure deterioration to inform critical stakeholders promptly to take action and adapt the societal functions accordingly. Digitalization is expected to enable a flourishing society and physical and natural environment across our cities and infrastructure, which play a significant role in the upcoming Society 5.0.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;References&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[1] Pytharouli, S., Michalis, P. and Raftopoulos, S.

Through the developmentof ESRI technologies, which allow the integration of WebGIS with Artificial Intelligence, the Internetof Things and aerospace Big Data, the Science of Where is defining new ways of designing and experiencingthe environment and the city. In this initial phase of the Digital Revolution it is essential to affirmthe paradigm of a society, called “Society 5.0”, capable of responding to the challenges of its owntime, balancing economic progress with solutions to social problems. The enabling factor of this paradigmis the Science of Where and the thesis that the Science of Where is the enabling factor of the paradigm thatimplements Society 5.0 is fascinating, but has to be demonstrated. In order to prove this thesis, holistic experimentationis necessary, which involves all the actors present in the theater of society in order to demonstratethe benefits of this philosophy in this field through the exercise of good practices. For this reason,ESRI Italia recently set up a laboratory to conduct experiments at its regional office in Cagliari (Italy). Theexperimentation is scheduled in a project called Sardinia 5.0. The Laboratory is equipped with all the infrastructures,technologies and data necessary for specialists to perform the assessment of the social impact ofexisting initiatives and the construction of scenarios for a possible future.

AB  - Digitalisasi proses bisnis pada organisasi sudah banyak diterapkan pada era society 5.0 ini. Salah satunya yaitu digunakan pada pembuatan dokumen faktur elektronik atau disebut dengan e-invoice . Kegiatan dalam organisasi tidak terlepas dari proses transaksi yang merupakan proses bisnis utama. Oleh karena itu, pentingnya menjaga keaslian data invoice agar tidak terjadi perubahan nilai yang beresiko pada pemalsuan data invoice . Salah satu system kriptografi yang dapat memberikan layanan keamanan data berupa integrasi dan autentikasi data yang dapat mendeteksi keaslian data yaitu tanda tangan digital atau digital signature . Penelitian ini membangun digital signature dengan menerapkan fungsi hashing Message Digest 5 (MD5) dan algoritma asimetris Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA). Simulasi penerapan digital signature pada dokumen e-invoice dilakukan dengan menggunakan software open-source kriptografi yaitu CrypTool versi 2.1. Desain simulasi sistem digital signature yaitu melalui proses hash menggunakan algoritma MD5, proses pembangkitan kunci menggunakan algoritma RSA, proses enkripsi dan dekripsi. Hasil simulasi digital signature yang dilakukan dengan menggunakan dokumen e-invoice menunjukkan hasil bahwa hasil hash dokumen MD5 dan dekripsi chipertext RSA memiliki nilai yang sama. Hal itu diartikan bahwa dokumen tersebut merupakan dokumen asli dan belum terjadi perubahan data di dalamnya.

AB  - Data transmission for the industrial Internet of Things (IoT) is crucial for industrial production, especially in the Industry 5.0 era, where human&#x2013;machine collaboration is increasingly intensive. To ensure the continuity and robustness of industrial IoT communications in the case of damaged infrastructure communication facilities postdisaster, the industrial IoT can be connected with satellite networks in emergencies. This article presents a cross-regional, end-to-end, transmission control scheme for satellite-supported, multihop industrial IoT. The proposed scheme adjusts the window of data transmission from two phases, slow start and congestion avoidance, to accommodate the low-transmission performance caused by a long delay and high bit error rate in converged networks. The window of data transmission is also adjusted to increase the amount of data transmission for the slow start to fill the high bandwidth-delay product of the converged network, while adjusting the threshold of data transmission based on feedback information to distinguish different data losses during congestion avoidance. The feasibility of the heterogeneous network transmission model is experimentally verified. The results show that the scheme can achieve good performance in heterogeneous networks of industrial IoT and satellite networks. The scheme is effective in ensuring the continuity and stability of intelligent machine production in Industry 5.0 in emergency communication cases.

AB  - Industrial IoT (IIoT) devices obtain, analyse, and use data from connected equipment, Operational Technology (OT), locations, and people. IIoT helps to regulate and monitor industrial systems. Also, the same implementation can be carried out for automated record updates of asset placement in industrial storage units. IIoT can realize the seamless integration of various manufacturing devices equipped with sensing, identification, processing, communication, actuation, and networking capabilities. Based on such a highly integrated smart cyber-physical space, it opens the door to create whole new business and market opportunities for manufacturing. Network control and management of manufacturing equipment, asset and situation management, or manufacturing process control bring the IIoT within the realm of industrial applications and smart manufacturing as well. IIoT in manufacturing could generate so much business value that it will eventually lead to the Fifth Industrial Revolution, also referred to as Industry 5.0. Though IIoT is getting widely explored and used by many global organizations, especially with the current COVID19 Pandemic situation. The global industry moves to address these concerns have begun including the development of international standards. This study examines the prospects of Industrial IoT and its application in the global business sectors for doing their businesses more effectively and efficiently. This study would assess the most suitable IIoT models of various IIoT services offerings industries will likely use. The study will also analyse risks and challenges for the global business entities, while adopting IIoT technologies and service offerings along with their actual needs, wants, desires, suitability, requirements, and expectations.

AB  - There is a lack of a single architecture specification that addresses the needs of trusted and secure Artificial Intelligence systems with humans in the loop, such as human-centered manufacturing systems at the core of the evolution towards Industry 5.0. To realize this, we propose an architecture that integrates forecasts, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, supports collecting users’ feedback and uses Active Learning and Simulated Reality to enhance forecasts and provide decision-making recommendations. The architecture security is addressed at all levels. We align the proposed architecture with the Big Data Value Association Reference Architecture Model. We tailor it for the domain of demand forecasting and validate it on a real-world case study.

AB  - The article examines how the roles of state institutions and state owned enterprises have been changed in Ireland since its independence, with special regard to the role of state ownership and crisis management. The history of planning and social partnership, the courses of nationalisation and privatisation and the problem of damaging the state are discussed as well. The author concludes that the crisis has not resulted in the strengthening of the developmental or welfare role of the state, the evolution of a “developmental welfare state” has become less likely in Ireland in the course of crisis management. Another lesson is that the state can manage certain bad assets of the private sector in a way that yields a profit to the public. There are other costs of the crisis management, however, which are to be paid by the people and result in a decrease of state ownership and a shrinking of the welfare systems.

AB  - An impact of a modern industrial system, such as in Industry 5.0, which brings customer authorization deeper into the manufacturing stream, may give pressure toward the industrial working system. Along with this system transformation, the declining trend of labor number as world demographical change created demand for higher productivity worker, which is stronger and more versatile for handling more than one working station, giving added value and personalization in fulfilling customer needs. Assistive Technology (AT) which is formerly for disabled or handicapped people, would be more widely used for everyone and working for its new purposes in producing higher individual physical capacity. A common challenge of providing a wearable AT, such as limb prostheses, orthoses, or exoskeletons, is customizing their geometry to fit on user body parts. In Industrial context, this would even be more challenging since it must be provided in massive number which can overburden companies overhead. The disruptive technology of prototyping such as 3D scanning and 3D printing brings a customized prototype into a new level of accomplishment life cycle and affordability. New processing technology and material development in 3D printing eventually transform rapid prototyping into rapid manufacturing of final AT product. This paper aims to examine recent research and development of AT from AT developers and communities as well as its novel development process. The new challenges of new AT existence are discussed further in the context of working safety and product standardization and a study about its impacts towards industrial productivity are highlighted.

AB  - Abstract Social computing, as the technical foundation of future computational smart societies, has the potential to improve the effectiveness of open-source big data usage, systematically integrate a variety of elements including time, human, resources, scenarios, and organizations in the current cyber-physical-social world, and establish a novel social structure with fair information, equal rights, and a flat configuration. Meanwhile, considering the big modeling gap between the model world and the physical world, the concept of parallel intelligence is introduced. With the help of software-defined everything, parallel intelligence bridges the big modeling gap by means of constructing artificial systems where computational experiments can be implemented to verify social policies, economic strategies, and even military operations. Artificial systems play the role of “social laboratories” in which decisions are computed before they are executed in our physical society. Afterwards, decisions with the expected outputs are executed in parallel in both the artificial and physical systems to interactively sense, compute, evaluate and adjust system behaviors in real-time, leading system behaviors in the physical system converging to those proven to be optimal in the artificial ones. Thus, the smart guidance and management for our society can be achieved.

	The objective of this article is to analyse the designer skills and company needs that are important for design culture development in the coming era of Industry 5.0. For this purpose, 83 SMEs operating in the manufacturing sector in Italy, Spain, Romania, and Poland were analysed. Qualitative and quantita-tive research conducted within the European project Intride let the authors state that in the 21st century context, companies will need to look for designers with specific skills. Based on their study, the authors indicate the most important skills for further development of design culture from the areas of soft, technological, design, digital, and green skills. Further, the authors suggest that it is necessary to con-tinue research on identifying the most needed skills for smart designers in manufacturing and in rele-vant curricula at universities, which might fill educational gaps related to these skills. They propose the concept of the “smart designer” as a design innovation trigger in the manufacturing sector.

AB  - ABSTRAK Indonesia menyimpan sumber daya genetik yang melimpah namun memiliki kelemahan dalam database nya. Hal ini menjadi celah adanya tindakan biopiracy dari perusahaan-perusahaan farmasi negara maju. Perkembangan teknologi informasi memasuki era teknologi 4.0 dan society 5.0. Perlindungan hukum sumber daya genetik dari sisi regulasi dan kelembagaan serta optimalisasi teknologi informasi dalam perlindungan non yuridis Metode penelitian yang digunakan yaitu yuridis normatif dengan pendekatan dekriptif analisis. Data dikumpulkan melalui studi pustaka dan wawancara dan dianalisis dengan metode yuridis kualitatif. Indonesia belum memiliki aturan khusus mengenai sumber daya genetik. Konvensi Keanekaragaman Hayati, Propokol Cartagena dan Protokol Nagoya belum optimal karena tidak didukung oleh negara maju yang menerapkan standard ganda. Perkembangan teknologi infomrasi menjadi peluang sekaligus tantangan. Teknologi informasi dapat menjadi sarana penyusunan database sumber daya genetik yang melimpah dan beragam. Pemanfaatan teknologi informasi menjadi mutlak dilakukan dan dapat menjadi sarana pembuktian secara elektronik serta upaya pencegahan klaim dari negara lain. Kata kunci: genetik; Indonesia; keragaman; informasi; teknologi ABSTRACT Indonesia stores abundant genetik resources but has weaknesses in its database. This becomes a gap in the biopiracy of the pharmaceutical companies in developed countries. The development of information technology entered the era of technology 4.0 and society 5.0. Legal protection of genetik resources in terms of regulation and institutions as well as optimization of information technology in non-juridical protection. The research method used is juridical normative with descriptive analysis approach. Data was collected through literature study and interviews and analyzed using qualitative juridical methods. Indonesia does not yet have specific rules regarding genetik resources. The Convention on Biological Diversity, the Cartagena Protocol and the Nagoya Protocol are not yet optimal because they are not supported by developed countries that apply double standards. The development of information technology is both an opportunity and a challenge. Information technology can be a means of compiling a database of abundant and diverse genetik resources. The use of information technology is absolutely necessary and can be a means of proving electronically and efforts to prevent claims from other countries.

AB  - Mining traffic-relevant information from social media data has become an emerging topic due to the real-time and ubiquitous features of social media. In this paper, we focus on a specific problem in social media mining which is to extract traffic relevant microblogs from Sina Weibo, a Chinese microblogging platform. It is transformed into a machine learning problem of short text classification. First, we apply the continuous bag-of-word model to learn word embedding representations based on a data set of three billion microblogs. Compared to the traditional one-hot vector representation of words, word embedding can capture semantic similarity between words and has been proved effective in natural language processing tasks. Next, we propose using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) models and their combination LSTM-CNN to extract traffic relevant microblogs with the learned word embeddings as inputs. We compare the proposed methods with competitive approaches, including the support vector machine (SVM) model based on a bag of n-gram features, the SVM model based on word vector features, and the multi-layer perceptron model based on word vector features. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed deep learning approaches.

AB  - Digital twins are currently one of the main tools for improving the operational efficiency of the main and auxiliary equipment. In the study, digital twins are used as a basis in predictive analytics systems. The comparison of the current measurement information coming from the sensors with the results calculated in the digital twins of the equipment units provides identification of the current technical condition. In this chapter, we consider one of the possible approaches to implementing the architecture of a software product for building a digital model of a thermal power plant thermal circuit—the allocation of layers. It describes the advantages and disadvantages of this method in designing, changing the source program code, and correcting the internal structure of software—refactoring. The main advantage of the method is scalability since thermal circuits can contain a large number of pieces of equipment. A three-level architectural solution of the digital twin construction subsystem has been developed. A fragment of a database accumulating the required data for obtaining calculated data using a digital double of the thermal circuit of a power plant is presented. It also shows the implementation of one of the abstract layers of the architecture—the database management system layer. The obtained results allow us to assert the effectiveness of the layers method application for use as part of predictive analytics systems using the concept of the main and auxiliary equipment digital twins of energy facilities.KeywordsDigital twinSoftwareDatabaseModelingTPP equipmentLife cycle

AB  - Recent integrity issues related to halal product is alarming. While the literature has introduced Industry 4.0 technologies, the reality in the food industry especially halal related product shows disparity in the contribution of scholars to real-world issue. The disparity between both literature and industry is due to information integration. The issue related to information integration can be solved through Society 5.0 where human and technology are connected through information management, monitoring, and control. Nevertheless, studies related to Society 5.0 are limited and isolated to social and technology area since the concept is still new in the literature. However, the advantages of integrating Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0 are able in ensuring integrity in food supply chain especially related to halal. Thus, the objective of this paper is to propose a model based on Society 5.0 to provide solution to food integrity in the supply chain. This study has undertaken extensive literature review related to Society 5.0 and integrity practices. The outcome of the paper proposed a model that links Society 5.0 and Industry 4.0 technologies to help organisation manage halal food in the supply chain with integrity as its measurements. The model proposed in this study is useful for any organisation to adopt halal supply chain and understand how to implement Industry 4.0 as well as managing information through Society 5.0.

AB  - The industrial revolution 4.0 presents challenges that must be faced by the business world, namely the lack of adequate HR (Human Resource) skills, the problem of security of communication technology, the reliability of the stability of production machines, the inability to change by stakeholders, and the number of job losses due to automation. Society 5.0 offers a human-centered society that makes a balance between economic progress and the resolution of social problems through a system that is highly connected through cyberspace and the real world. If society 4.0 allows anyone to access also share information on the internet. Society 5.0 is an era where all technology is part of humanity itself. To take advantage of opportunities and answer the challenges of the industrial revolution 4.0, Indonesian people in particular are required to have data, technology and human literacy capabilities. Data literacy is needed by HR to improve skills in processing and analyzing big data for the benefit of improving public and business services. Technology literacy shows the ability to utilize digital technology to process data and information, while human literacy must be mastered because it shows the element of soft skills or the development of individual character to be able to collaborate, be adaptive, and innovative. Indonesia is demanded to be able to follow industry 4.0 workflows juxtaposed with society 5.0. The need for human resources in several business fields is still very massive if all of them are carried out by robotics. Indonesia is a developing country with a fairly dense population that is certainly able to align between the needs of industry 4.0 and society 5.0. Leadership in organizations must stay alive so that every innovative competitive strategy is able to run with the existing vision. To go to the era of society 5.0 the government is obliged to continuously control it.

AB  - This article is a bibliometric review. Information data were collected using the Methodi Ordinatio methodology, which consists of searching for the research topic, keyword selection, searching for data in Scopus, ScienceDirect and Web of Science, filtering and analysis, extraction to the Zotero referencer and, finally, reading and writing. A timeline from industry 1.0 to industry 5.0 shows the human robot partnership as well as the industrial and technological evolution of robots from the 1960s to 2020. In Germany, robotic automation has decreased jobs with average qualifications in machine operation occupations by 23 %. Citrus fruit picking in Florida has an efficiency of 85 %, and it is estimated that by 2025 the profit for companies could double by 1.5 %. In New Zealand, kiwifruit production should double by 2022. This application of process modeling not only encourages sustainable supply chain initiatives, which can maximize economic gains, but also reduce environmental impacts. The McKinsey Global Institute forecasts from 2020 to 2030, job automation will increase from 30% to 47%. In conclusion, it is possible that a robot will affect jobs for citizens of low educational level. The robotic design plan at the forefront of new advances in science, technology, engineering and predictive modeling must improve, adapting to the needs of man and the development of the country, and thus be able to detect even certain emotions.

AB  - This chapter describes what a factory is like, or rather, what the “factory” species is like, and the different types of factories of the future. Next, it focuses on business, which needs to evolve towards industry 4.0. For this, the chapter analyzes the decline of industry, which encouraged the leap towards industry 4.0. Then, it argues that society 5.0 might belong to a new industrial religion, an industry whose symbol might be the absence of a symbolic place, but also that of production carried out closer to the consumer. Different business theorists have defined fundamental structures of the firm. These structures can be challenged by the arrival of society 5.0 only if information flows or the exchange of data are inefficient. The chapter explores all these structures. Further, it discusses two determinants of the factory of the future: case digitization and direct manufacturing. Finally, the chapter explains the management of the factory of the future.

AB  - Today, sustainable innovation is designed to develop from the lineal model to the circular one. Attempts are made to offer – starting from an upgrade of knowledge and educational paths – a new innovative society (known as Society 5.0 or Super Smart Society) where companies and territorial stakeholders are a part of complex relation systems leading to the creation of new sustainable and intertwined supply chains (territorial networking), also with the support of properly designed tools such as the service platforms. In this scenario, design develops new planning visions based on relational paradigms and represents the bridge between technological innovation and social contexts since it is able to plan technology by harmonizing cultural, social, economical and political elements.

AB  - In order to realize the goals of Industry 5.0 (I5.0), which has data interoperability as one of its core principles, the future research in the Supply Chain (SC) visibility has to be aligned with socially, economically and environmentally sustainable objectives. Within the purview of circular economy, this paper indicates various aspects and implications of data sharing in the SCs in light of the published research. Taking into consideration the heterogeneity of data sources and standards, this article also catalog all the major data-sharing technologies being employed in sharing data digitally across the SCs. Drawing on the published research from 2015 to 2021, following the PRISMA framework, this paper presents the state of research in the field of data sharing in SCs in terms of their standardization, optimization, simulation, automation, security and more notably sustainability. Using the co-occurrence metric, bibliometric analysis has been conducted such that the collected research is categorized under various keyword clusters and regional themes. This article brings together two major themes in reviewing the research in the field. Firstly, the bibliometric analysis of the published articles makes manifest the contours of the current state of research and the future possibilities in the field. Secondly, in synthesizing the research on the foundations of sustainability within the CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework, this article deals with the various aspects and implications of information sharing in the SCs. By bringing these two themes together, this paper affords a prospective researcher with the research vis-à-vis the information sharing in SC, starting from the actual data standards in use to the modality and consequence of their application within the perspective of the circular economy. This article, in essence, indicates how all the aspects of data sharing in SCs may be brought together in service of the theme of I5.0.

AB  - Education in Indonesia from elementary to college has experienced a change in the learning process caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, one of them is learning in the field of music, which was originally offline and later because of this pandemic learning was carried out online. The government's policy is to carry out all activities at home, in order to cut the chain of the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, which is a tough test for music educators. These changes occur because of the community's efforts to adapt to new needs, conditions, and conditions that arise in line with the growth of society. Not finished with the issue of the Industrial Revolution 4.0, now people are faced with back with the issue of society 5.0, objects and all existing social orders integrated with the virtual world. The purpose of this research to determine continuity of music education during the Covid-19 pandemic in the era of the Society 5.0. The method used is literature review, namely using various sources of reference both from research results and from the thoughts of other authors. The results of this conceptual research are expected to provide local wisdom values because music is one of the important elements for society in facing a changing era.

AB  - The increasing need for economic, safe, and sustainable smart manufacturing combined with novel technological enablers has paved the way for artificial intelligence (AI) and big data in industries. This implies a substantial integration of AI, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), Robotics, big data, Blockchain, and 5G communications in support of smart manufacturing and the dynamical processes in modern industries. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of different aspects of AI and big data in Industry 4.0 with a particular focus on key applications, techniques, the concepts involved, key enabling technologies, challenges, and research perspective toward deployment of Industry 5.0. In detail, we highlight and analyze how the duo of AI and big data is helping in different applications of Industry 4.0. We also highlight key challenges in a successful deployment of AI and big data solutions in smart industrial applications with a particular emphasis on data-related issues, such as availability, bias, auditing, management, interpretability, communication, and different adversarial attacks and security issues. Finally, we explore the significance of AI and big data toward Industry 4.0 applications through panoramic reviews and discussions. This work is expected to provide a baseline for future research in the domain.

AB  - We are only at the beginning of a rapid period of transformation of our economy and society due to the convergence of many digital technologies. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is central to this change and offers major opportunities to improve our lives. The recent developments in AI are the result of increased processing power, improvements in algorithms and the exponential growth in the volume and variety of digital data. Many applications of AI have started entering into our every-day lives, from machine translations, to image recognition, and music generation, and are increasingly deployed in industry, government, and commerce. Connected and autonomous vehicles, and AI-supported medical diagnostics are areas of application that will soon be commonplace. There is strong global competition on AI among the US, China, and Europe. The US leads for now but China is catching up fast and aims to lead by 2030. For the EU, it is not so much a question of winning or losing a race but of finding the way of embracing the opportunities offered by AI in a way that is human-centred, ethical, secure, and true to our core values. The EU Member States and the European Commission are developing coordinated national and European strategies, recognising that only together we can succeed. We can build on our areas of strength including excellent research, leadership in some industrial sectors like automotive and robotics, a solid legal and regulatory framework, and very rich cultural diversity also at regional and sub-regional levels. It is generally recognised that AI can flourish only if supported by a robust computing infrastructure and good quality data: • With respect to computing, we identified a window of opportunity for Europe to invest in the emerging new paradigm of computing distributed towards the edges of the network, in addition to centralised facilities. This will support also the future deployment of 5G and the Internet of Things. • With respect to data, we argue in favour of learning from successful Internet companies, opening access to data and developing interactivity with the users rather than just broadcasting data. In this way, we can develop ecosystems of public administrations, firms, and civil society enriching the data to make it fit for AI applications responding to European needs. We should embrace the opportunities afforded by AI but not uncritically. The black box characteristics of most leading AI techniques make them opaque even to specialists. AI systems are currently limited to narrow and well-defined tasks, and their technologies inherit imperfections from their human creators, such as the well-recognised bias effect present in data. We should challenge the shortcomings of AI and work towards strong evaluation strategies, transparent and reliable systems, and good human-AI interactions. Ethical and secure-by-design algorithms are crucial to build trust in this disruptive technology, but we also need a broader engagement of civil society on the values to be embedded in AI and the directions for future development. This social engagement should be part of the effort to strengthen our resilience at all levels from local, to national and European, across institutions, industry and civil society. Developing local ecosystems of skills, computing, data, and applications can foster the engagement of local communities, respond to their needs, harness local creativity and knowledge, and build a human-centred, diverse, and socially driven AI. We still know very little about how AI will impact the way we think, make decisions, relate to each other, and how it will affect our jobs. This uncertainty can be a source of concern but is also a sign of opportunity. The future is not yet written. We can shape it based on our collective vision of what future we would like to have. But we need to act together and act fast.

AB  - A logistics is the movement of goods and services in supply chain to provide facilities and distribution options of movement of products, information of products, and distribution of products from suppliers to customers. The new Industry 5.0 has a positive impact on the performance of the logistics. Logistics information system is a root of supply chain to collect the information related to products and track the information and services related to the products in a supply chain manner. A sound logistics information system can lead to cost reduction and can also improve customer satisfaction. However, research on IoT adoption in logistics is acceptance of IoT into supply chain services in specific has been rhetoric. IoT creates far-reaching payoffs for all the operations of logistics among the suppliers and customers. This benefit extends across the entire logistics information system, including inventory, transportation, and delivery system with better efficiency, security, and safety. This chapter is drawn upon the organizational capability theory for developing effects of IoT on logistics management and in turn improves logistics information system as well as organizational performance.

AB  - Industrial Era 4.0 has passed; it's time to adapt to society 5.0, where people use technology with a digital role as an unavoidable interaction. One of them is the coffee shop business, which began to be loved by coffee lovers or coffeeholic. The RACE framework and the AIDA Model aim to attract consumers. Like om bewok coffee shop that takes the theme of Banten coffee as a source of coffee that comes from the local, this shop has a message that Banten coffee turns out to exist in some places, although not all of them exist. Om bewok coffee shop has a distinctive logo and strong branding with the help of digital marketing. Qualitative research by conducting observations and interviews and literature studies on research objects in coffee shops om bewok. The results showed that om bewok coffee shop business has been running for two years by lifting coffee from its own area. As one of the coffee shop startups in Serang City, this shop uses the help of digital technology in branding and promoting its products and starting from the use of Google Business, WhatsApp Business, Social Media, email, website, Youtube. For delivery and order problems, you can order through GoFood or Grab and pay with a digital wallet or COD. They are collaborating with serang city government in terms of the legality of business license, Halal, p-IRT. As well as synergizing with coffee farmers, other coffee shop partners, as well as building relationships with youth communities in Serang City. Lastly, cooperate with Baznas related to the distribution of zakat with the help of QRIS or barcode. So powerful is digital marketing to build a relationship that is quite extensive

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the use of artificial intelligence to improve audit quality, combined with the competence and skepticism of auditors on client satisfaction. The unit of analysis in this study was selected as a sample based on the purposive sampling method which was chosen deliberately with certain criteria that have been determined by the researcher. The main source of data used in this study comes from primary data, namely questionnaires distributed directly via email to each respondent. Respondents in this study were middle level management, who were directly related to auditors at the time of the audit of companies listed on the Jakarta Stock Exchange. The sample in this study numbered 229 respondents who were processed and analyzed using SEM PLS. This research is based on the Society 5.0 era where data connects and moves everything; a system that connects the virtual world and the real world. The era of the fourth industrial revolution, where the discovery of the internet of things allows the interconnection between machines, big data, acquisition, machine learning, smart factories and others, and financial reports to be made using a computerized system. The global Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on almost all sectors and restrictions on activities. As a result of the corona virus, most activities or work are carried out from home. The results of this study prove that the effect of the application of artificial intelligence combined with auditor competence and auditor professional skepticism creates client satisfaction.

AB  - The development of modern industrial production, based on the principles of Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0, inevitably implies the introduction of an entire digitalization of information flows used for managing the industrial enterprise. In this respect, the implementation of business information systems of the ERP class is an obligatory process for any modern production process, not only in order to optimize the internal processes for the company, but also because of the need for reliable and effective integration with other actors in the supply chain. This paper presents the author’s views on how to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of an ERP system in specific business conditions. In this respect, a group of indicators has been developed that account for the different influences on the efficiency and effectiveness of the implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning System.

AB  - The current statuses and future promises of the Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Everything (IoE) and Internet of Nano-Things (IoNT) are extensively reviewed and a summarized survey is presented. The analysis clearly distinguishes between IoT and IoE, which are wrongly considered to be the same by many commentators. After evaluating the current trends of advancement in the fields of IoT, IoE and IoNT, this paper identifies the 21 most significant current and future challenges as well as scenarios for the possible future expansion of their applications. Despite possible negative aspects of these developments, there are grounds for general optimism about the coming technologies. Certainly, many tedious tasks can be taken over by IoT devices. However, the dangers of criminal and other nefarious activities, plus those of hardware and software errors, pose major challenges that are a priority for further research. Major specific priority issues for research are identified.

AB  - With the beginning of the fifth industrial revolution, Artificial Intelligence has changed the nature of work where human needs to be more creative, innovative, and relationship oriented. For a sustainable working environment, the value of emotional and social competencies has increased day by day while Emotional Intelligence (EI) has captured as a pinnacle in Human Resource Development literature. The study focused on the significance of Emotional Intelligence from an occupational perspective.  The findings reveal why an organization should care about the emotional intelligence of its employees. Since an organization can attain a competitive advantage through the people, hence Emotional intelligence could make a difference from an average performer to high-value performer.  In this study, the role of Emotional Intelligence has critically analyzed with the evidence of empirical researches published in peer-reviewed journals.  The study underlines the essentials of EI in job performance, job satisfaction, Organization citizenship behavior, leadership effectiveness, Team Management, Work-life balance and Employee wellbeing. From the Human Resource Development perspective, organization should emphasize on developing Emotional Intelligence of its employees to make them productive, satisfied and committed for achieving organization’s goals and maintaining better working environment.

AB  - Are new technologies in the medicine sector a driver to support the development of a society 5.0? Innovation pushes the artisan to become smart and lean, customer-oriented but within a standardized environment of production, maintaining and ensuring the quality of the product. An artisan is a user and innovator, as an essential part of the industrial chain. In the healthcare sector, the doctor is the industrial artisan, and medicine can be considered as an example of a smart tool, strongly tailored, that embeds the innovation of materials, nano-devices, and smart technology (e.g., sensors and controllers). But how much of society is ready to host smart technology “on board”, becoming “on life”, constantly connected with remote controls that allow us to monitor, gather data, and, in any case, act, with preventive healthcare solutions? After a short overview of the medicine sector, a preliminary, tentative link between technological innovation and the healthcare sector allows us to adopt several outlooks on how to change research, always more transdisciplinary, combining science with social science in order to remain human-centered.

AB  - Emergence of industry 5.0 facilitates real-time synchronisation of production processes, which helps with the production of customized products. Although industry 5.0 can revolutionize the landscape of goods production, still its adoption is in the infancy stage. Hence, the purpose of this article is to examine barriers that impede the adoption of industry 5.0, and to propose solution initiatives (SIs). After an in-depth literature review and interviews with German industry experts in pharmaceutical sector, barriers and SIs are ranked using an integrated Analytical hierarchy process-elimination and choice expressing reality-decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (AHP-ELECTRE-DEMATEL) approach. “Linking virtual reality and reality” is found to be the most critical deterrent to the adoption of industry 5.0, and falls into a causal group, which signifies their influence on other deterrents. “Measures for better connectivity with patients” is of utmost importance for German firms to ensure secure communication and safeguard patient data. The findings also highlight the problems with the adoption of high-tech innovations due to lack of standardization and fair benchmarking policies on industry 5.0. This article concludes by proposing an industry 5.0 framework. The inhibitors to adopting industry 5.0 were investigated in this article, the results of which will assist practitioners and decision makers to understand the issues with industry 5.0. The results of this article will help potential adopters of this technology to look for the SIs. This will therefore pave the path for effective adoption of industry 5.0 across the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector.

AB  - In modern digital era, technology has dominated in all sectors of society. In manufacturing sectors, technology development has been divided into different time zones (Industry 1.0–4.0). These industrial upheavals have highly focused on technology applications. But modern challenges of customization, personalization and technology upgrading can only be done by human involvement. These modern challenges have led to new industrial revolution called “Industry 5.0,” which emphasizes on technology advancement with human empowerment. In this research paper, authors have studied the enablers, which help in execution of Industry 5.0 in Indian manufacturing sector. Eight enablers have been distinguished by literature review and specialist’s supposition. By using total interpretative structural modeling (TISM) technique, authors have studied the relationship between these enablers. Authors have developed a diagraph to show structural relationship between different enablers influencing implementation of Industry 5.0 in Indian manufacturing sector.

AB  - In the past, manufacturing equipment was instrumented hard-wired. Industrial equipment such as sensors, controllers, and others are expensive, and upgrading manufacturing equipment in existing facilities is costly. The growing use of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven cost reductions in sensors, controllers, and communications through high volumes of digital devices and value-added components. The manufacturing sector with its massive installed base of legacy equipment has also become an area of interest for the advances in innovative digital technologies. Meanwhile, the next level of innovation in manufacturing has been achieved, labeled by the term 4th Industrial Revolution, in short Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 takes the automation of manufacturing processes to a new level by introducing customized and intelligent production technologies. Machines are connected and communicate with each other to ultimately make decisions, operate independently, or cooperate with humans in a customer-oriented production environment. This raises the question about the key issues of the next industrial enhancement and the term to call it? The change from Industry 4.0 to the next innovative industrial enhancement is termed Industry 5.0. However, Industry 5.0 has its root in the concept of Industry 4.0. Thus, the key issues of the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 can be seen in the goal of making manufacturability sustainable from economic, ecologic and societal perspectives. This requires building a circular economy with a focus on a human centric industry. The paper describes the development from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0.

AB  - <jats:p>The industry transition towards digital transformation opens the possibilities to utilize data for enhancing sustainability in industrial operations and build capabilities towards resilient and circular operations, i.e., shift towards industry 5.0. This paper explores how data-driven decision-making (DDDM) can enable sustainable and resilient supply chain operations within the manufacturing industry. A series of in-depth interviews were conducted with experts, researchers, and company representatives across the manufacturing industry and universities in Sweden. The findings show a consensus among companies, researchers, and literature about the potential of data utilization for sustainability purposes; however, in most cases, the complete transformation towards data-driven has not happened yet. Companies have uncertainty about what data is needed rather than its lack. Reliability &amp; validity of data become essential to exploit the potential of the data organizations already possess. Based on the literature and interview data, a conceptual model is proposed, including three identified parameters connected to DDDM, 1) data and IT infrastructure, 2) current operations, and 3) an improved triple bottom line performance. The model captures the interconnections between such parameters, depicting the benefits and challenges of DDDM and its relation to more sustainable and resilient supply chain operations within the manufacturing industry. In a data-driven approach, real-time analysis of complex &amp; extensive amounts of data gives unlimited possibilities to improve manufacturing operations through decision-making.</jats:p>

AB  - The technological world is ever-evolving, and industries worldwide must match the pace of inevitable change. We are in the midst of the fourth industrial revolution, and many are suggesting that there may be a fifth industrial revolution in sectors where human interaction is critical. Control rooms are important functional units in many industries, which raises the question of the relevance of Industry 4.0 technologies in the modern-day control room system. A focus area of this study includes defining a generalised operational architecture of a real-world control room with event management functionality — the ‘AS-IS’ model. The impact of intelligent technologies on typical control room operations is modelled holistically (’TO-BE’), and compared with contemporary control rooms to unearth design considerations for future control room development.

AB  - • A real assembly line balancing problem with human-robot collaboration is studied. • A new MILP model is proposed for the problem. • An adaptive SA algorithm is proposed with customized characteristics. • The SA’s performance is validated in real-world cases from the automotive industry. In light of the Industry 5.0 trend towards human-centric and resilient industries, human-robot collaboration (HRC) assembly lines can be used to enhance productivity and workers’ well-being, provided that the optimal allocation of tasks and available resources can be determined. This study investigates the assembly line balancing problem (ALBP), considering HRC. This problem, abbreviated ALBP-HRC, arises in advanced manufacturing systems, where humans and collaborative robots share the same workplace and can simultaneously perform tasks in parallel or in collaboration. Driven by the need to solve the more complex assembly line-balancing problems found in the automotive industry, this study aims to address the ALBP-HRC with the cycle time and the number of operators (humans and robots) as the primary and secondary objective, respectively. In addition to the traditional ALBP constraints, the human and robot characteristics, in terms of task times, allowing multiple humans and robots at stations, and their joint/collaborative tasks are formulated into a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. A neighborhood-search simulated annealing (SA) is proposed with customized solution representation and neighborhood search operators designed to fit into the problem characteristics. Furthermore, the proposed SA features an adaptive neighborhood selection mechanism that enables the SA to utilize its exploration history to dynamically choose appropriate neighborhood operators as the search evolves. The proposed MILP and SA are implemented on real cases taken from the automotive industry where stations are designed for HRC. The computational results over different problems show that the adaptive SA produces promising solutions compared to the MILP and other swarm intelligence algorithms, namely genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and artificial bee colony. The comparisons of human/robot versus HRC settings in the case study indicate significant improvement in the productivity of the assembly line when multiple humans and robots with collaborative tasks are permissible at stations.

AB  - Benefiting from the marriage of just-in-time (JIT) and computer integrated manufacturing (CIM), a series of manufacturing planning and control (MPC) systems has been introduced for contemporary production and operations management. However, the increasing requirements for customized and personalized products and services, together with the acceleration of the socio-economic environment in the age of Industry 4.0, forced manufacturers to re-evaluate their current MPC strategies that mainly emphasize time, cost and quality priorities. Industry 4.0 presents a solid ambition for transforming to a digital, data-driven and interconnected manufacturing industry centred around cyber-physical convergence. Although the relevance of Industry 4.0 technologies’ disruptions on operations management has been acknowledged, a significant gap in the evolution of the logic and design of MPC systems has been observed. The requirements of on-demand products and services with enhanced flexibility, resilience, sustainability and humanitarianism in this new industrial revolution call for innovations of MPC architectures and approaches. This paper first summarizes the evolution of MPC systems with enabling technologies and the changing business climate at that time. To explore innovative MPC that complies with the increasing economic, social and environmental requirements, the concept of synchronization-oriented MPC with four principles is proposed. Following the principles, a general framework for the synchronization-oriented MPC with enhanced economic, social and environmental benefits is developed. This work potentially provides insights into innovative MPC in the age of Industry 4.0 and even Industry 5.0.

AB  - Enterprises and information societies confront crucial challenges currently, while Industry 4.0 becomes important in the global manufacturing industry and Society 5.0 should contribute to a supersmart society, especially for healthcare. Physical activity monitoring digital platforms are architected to improve the healthcare status of patients with diabetes and other lifestyle-related diseases. Furthermore, digital platforms are expected to generate profits for health technology companies and help control costs in the healthcare ecosystem. However, current digital enterprise architecture approaches are not well-established, and the potentials have not yet been realized. Design thinking approach and agile software development methodologies can overcome these limitations, beginning with proof of concept and pilot projects and then scaling to the production environment. In this paper, we describe how that the adaptive integrated digital architecture framework (AIDAF) for Design Thinking approach is proposed and verified in a case of a university hospital in the Americas. In addition, challenges and future activities for this area are discussed that cover the directions for Society 5.0.

AB  - The global system continues to process by keeping its essence through some protective and nationalist attempts. It is actually significant that the global system involves a multidimensional and technology-driven structure and that national-states’ regulations occur along with transnational practices. In this system, new technologies have a big role. New technologies consist of some innovations such as artificial intelligence, robotics, big data, internet of things, cloud technology, and so on, that describe the concept of ‘Society 5.0’ proposed by Japan and the concept of ‘Industry 4.0’ proposed by Germany. These technologies create super smart society in terms of their impacts on improving human life. Smart technologies improve human life in the fields of education, health, security, etc. On the other hand, smart technologies used in the process of production shape the global production network and the innovative strategies of firms. It is required that new technologies should not be remained uncontrolled within the logic of ‘laissez faire’ because their impacts and power are so great. Thus, national-states should make efficient economic policies by also considering transnational practices; like that Japan and Germany develop their own national view in terms of Society 5.0 and Industry 4.0. Such fields come into prominence in the economic policies in respect of new technologies: Competition policy on the basis of global competition and innovativeness—Industrialization policy on the basis of emerging industries of new technologies—Intellectual property policy on the basis of the rights of people and firms producing knowledge and innovation—Employment policy on the basis of new occupations and specialities in the global age—Social policy on the basis of new technologies’ control on individual and social life.

AB  - At present, there is no consistent definition of the term «personalized nutrition». The paper presents existing descriptors in this field of food science: precision nutrition, nutrigenomics, nutrigenetics, individual nutrition and so on. It is noted that cardiovascular diseases occupy the first place among noninfectious diseases associated with malnutrition. Optimal nutrition leads to a reduction in the risk of their occurrence. The methodology of structural-parametric modeling, which allows designing personalized optimal human nutrition based on medical indicators, is presented in terms of minimization of the risk function. The algorithm of a substantiated optimal choice of mass fractions of components (ingredients) of the food recipe composition is given. The main descriptors of a food product with the antisclerotic action for its designing using structural-parametric modeling are shown.

AB  - In the context of the Industry 4.0 approach, applications and solutions supporting monitoring, simulation, optimisation and decision-making in production systems are exponentially growing. These solutions are commonly built on digital twins, i.e., comprehensive, structured and effective digital representations of the production system and its entities, whose current status is constantly updated by the plugged data sources. The arising of the Industry 5.0 paradigm and the established key role of workers in manufacturing require new Digital Twins to represent also humans. In fact, as cognitive automation becomes more and more pervasive and its behaviour unintelligible to humans, it becomes essential for improving performance and well-being, at the same time, to model humans as data-driven agents and to represent their interaction with the factory systems. Currently, a standardised solution for creating Digital Twins is missing, forcing industrial solution architects to resort to ad-hoc implementations and models. These solutions lack re-usability, scalability and extensibility, preventing the introduction of a human digital representation in existent twins, so hindering the complete shift to the new Industry 5.0 paradigm. In this paper, such limitations are faced by introducing an extensible and flexible IIoT-industrial internet of things-based platform with a twofold benefit: on the one hand, to support the creation of customised data representations of production systems and their entities including humans; on the other hand, to provide a modular infrastructure, along with its interchangeable components, for easy digital twin instantiation and ramp-up. An implementation of the platform has been tested with different applications in a laboratory setting and released as a public resource. Finally, potential future applications of the proposed digital twin are discussed, highlighting its main benefits.

AB  - The low ability of students to solve problems is in line with the low mastery of science concepts. In this study, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) integrated Project Oriented Problem Based Learning (POPBL) learning models were implemented to improve the mastery of science concepts of junior high school students, especially on the topic of Environmental Pollution. The method used was a mixed-method. The STEM integrated STB learning model design framework consists of 3 stages: Onset Stage, Execution Stage, and Closure Stage. The concept of students is emphasized at the onset stage in the case study dissemination phase. In this phase, students analyze problems based on articles provided by the teacher. The more understanding the material, the more critical students will explore existing issues and find logical solutions to those problems. The results showed that there was a difference between the average pretest and posttest learning outcomes (t=-5,660; df = 53; Sig. (2-tailed) = 0,000). This indicates an increase in junior high school students' science concepts mastery after using the STEM integrated POPBL Learning Model. Improving students' mastery of concepts using a STEM integrated POPBL learning model is still in the low category with n-gain = 0.17. Although still in the low category, the POPBL learning model with the STEM approach can be optimized to improve students' mastery of concepts and skills on other science topics.

AB  - <jats:p>We provide an experimental evaluation of a wearable augmented reality (AR) system we have developed for human-robot teams working on tasks requiring collaboration in shared physical workspace. Recent advances in AR technology have facilitated the development of more intuitive user interfaces for many human-robot interaction applications. While it has been anticipated that AR can provide a more intuitive interface to robot assistants helping human workers in various manufacturing scenarios, existing studies in robotics have been largely limited to teleoperation and programming. Industry 5.0 envisions cooperation between human and robot working in teams. Indeed, there exist many industrial tasks that can benefit from human-robot collaboration. A prime example is high-value composite manufacturing. Working with our industry partner towards this example application, we evaluated our AR interface design for shared physical workspace collaboration in human-robot teams. We conducted a multi-dimensional analysis of our interface using established metrics. Results from our user study (n = 26) show that, subjectively, the AR interface feels more novel and a standard joystick interface feels more dependable to users. However, the AR interface was found to reduce physical demand and task completion time, while increasing robot utilization. Furthermore, user’s freedom of choice to collaborate with the robot may also affect the perceived usability of the system.</jats:p>

AB  - Technological competitiveness and emerging technologies are more necessary in the organizational strategy to cope with industrial advances and improve the nation's economy. In this sense, technological innovation, computational developments, smart devices, and other technologies are shaping the new industrial revolutions. Therefore, the technological competitiveness and emerging technologies of industry 4.0 and industry 5.0 are holistically analyzed to identify the key elements of developed economies and emerging economies. For this, we used a bibliometric analysis with Biblioshiny, a systematic review of the literature and a content analysis. The results in terms of technological competitiveness in developed economies show the importance of the competences and engineering skills in the personnel approach; R+D+i and the supply chain in the organizational approach; and the use of emerging technologies such as the internet of things and big data. The comparison with emerging economies indicates the importance of key elements such as training and education, and skills in the personnel approach; sustainability and structure in the organizational approach; and emerging technologies such as the internet of things and digitalization.

AB  - Manufacturers want flexible operations that allow them to use one production line to make multiple products. However, the benefits of flexibility are hard to capture because time-consuming changeovers are required to prepare machinery to manufacture different products. By implementing lean tools, such as single-minute exchange of dies, manufacturers can remove non-value-adding activities from the changeover, thus significantly accelerating the process. Companies, that implemented lean methods and Operations Management 4.0 will be able to benefit from these technologies (Kupper et al. 2017). New sensors and software make it possible for machines to automatically identify products and load the appropriate program and tools without manual intervention. Because the changeover is automated, operators can focus on performing value-adding activities.

AB  - With the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, vaccination is an urgent need worldwide. Internet of Things (IoT) has a vital role in the smart city for vaccine manufacturing with wearable sensors. According to the advanced services in intelligent manufacturing, the fourth resolution is also changing in Industry 5.0 and utilizes high-definition connectivity sensors. Traditional manufacturing companies rely on trusted third parties, which may act as a single point of failure. Access control, big data, and scalability are also challenging issues in existing systems because of the demand response data (DRD) in advanced manufacturing. To mitigate these challenges, CoVAC: A P2P Smart Contract-based Intelligent Smart City Architecture for Vaccine Manufacturing is proposed with three layers, including connection, conversion, and intelligent cloud layer. Smart contract-based blockchain is utilized at the conversion layer for resolving access control, security, and privacy issues. Deep learning is adopted in the intelligent cloud layer for big data analysis and increasing production for vaccine manufacturing in smart city environments. A case study is carried out wherein access data are collected from the various smart plants for vaccines using smart manufacturing to validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. Simulation of the proposed architecture is performed on the collected advanced sensor IoT plants data to address the challenges above, offering scalable production in the vaccine manufacturing for the smart city.

AB  - <jats:p>Information, communication, and energy technologies have the potential to improve engineering education worldwide. With the availability of low cost, open-source microcontrollers/microcomputers, such as the Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms, and a wide variety of sensors and communication tools, a range of engineering applications and innovations may be developed at a low price. Furthermore, the cost of solar panels and LED lamps have also dropped dramatically in recent years and these also allow for improved energy support in regions that lack energy access or require autonomous monitoring/processing. Also, low-cost 3D printers are now widely available for making simple prototypes of hardware. Finally, low-cost educational software tools have also become available. Combining these technologies enables engineering education to be brought into traditionally inaccessible communities in the world. In this book chapter, examples of how ICT and energy technologies are being used to teach students engineering technologies in underserved communities will be described. Application areas to be described will include environmental monitoring, clean water systems, and remote learning.</jats:p>

AB  - In this paper we introduce a research agenda to guide the development of the next generation of Discrete Event Simulation (DES) systems. Interfaces to digital twins are projected to go beyond physical representations to become blueprints for the actual “objects” and an active dashboard for their control. The role and importance of real-time interactive animations presented in an Extended Reality (XR) format will be explored. The need for using game engines, particularly their physics engines and AI within interactive simulated Extended Reality is expanded on. Importing and scanning real-world environments is assumed to become more efficient when using AR. Exporting to VR and AR is recommended to be a default feature. A technology framework for the next generation simulators is presented along with a proposed set of implementation guidelines. The need for more human centric technology approaches, nascent in Industry 4.0, are now central to the emerging Industry 5.0 paradigm; an agenda that is discussed in this research as part of a human in the loop future, supported by DES. The potential role of Explainable Artificial Intelligence is also explored along with an audit trail approach to provide a justification of complex and automated decision-making systems with relation to DES. A technology framework is proposed, which brings the above together and can serve as a guide for the next generation of holistic simulators for manufacturing.

AB  - Industry 5.0 is growing as the next industrial evolution, aiming to improve production efficiency in the 21st century. This evolution relies mainly on advanced digital technologies, including Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), by deploying multiple and heterogenous IIoT devices within industrial systems. Such a setup increases the possibility of threats, especially with the emergence of IIoT botnets. This can provide attackers with more sophisticated tools to conduct devastating IIoT attacks. In this paper, we design a novel MEC-based framework to secure IIoT applications leveraging federated learning, called FedGame. Specifically, FedGame enables multiple MEC domains to securely collaborate in order to cope with IIoT attacks, while preserving the privacy of IIoT devices. Moreover, a non-cooperative game is formulated on top of FedGame, to enable MEC nodes acquiring the needed virtual resources from the centralized MEC orchestrator, and hence to deal with each type of IIoT attacks. We evaluate FedGame using real-world IIoT attacks; results show not only the accuracy of FedGame against centralized ML/DL schemes, while preserving the privacy of Industrial systems, but also its efficiency in providing the required MECs resources.

AB  - <jats:p>The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the roots of every economy and completely transformed the way every industry functions including the education sector. The education sector completely adopted the remote teaching concept thereby connecting educators and students through technology. The present study aims at understanding that how Education 4.0 has helped in creating an intelligent learning space aligned with disruptive technologies for developing and enhancing education with learners at the center and further how this has facilitated remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic. For the purpose of study, secondary sources of data including research papers and news articles based on the similar themes were referred. Education 4.0 has completely transformed the way the education sector functions by putting the learner at the center and making the entire process student-centric where the learner will decide what they want to study rather than putting a predefined syllabus in front of them. The intelligent learning space is created through the application of emerging technologies. </jats:p>

AB  - We are developing detectors to sense the visible part of the spectrum. We are also developing light-sources that generate spectral signals from micro-samples introduced (for compatibility reasons) into micro-plasmas. Our battery- operated microplasmas are coupled to a portable, fiber-optic spectrometer and this combination (or system) can be thought of as a "multi parameter" or "multi-element sensor" for the UV and the Vis parts of the spectrum. Initially, our Micro Plasma Devices (MPDs) were fabricated using technologies borrowed from the semiconductor industry (e.g., microfluidics, micromachining) [1] . To reduce fabrication costs and to enable rapid prototyping [2] , we fabricated Micro Plasma Devices using 3D-printing of polymeric materials [3] . We also fabricated (and continue to characterize) a relatively- inexpensive self-powered detector on a flexible polymeric substrate [4] . The detector responds to light from the visible part of the spectrum. To enable portability for chemical measurements on-site (i.e., in the field) we often used a smartphone for data acquisition and signal processing, thus enabling a sensor-system to be placed on the Internet of Things (IoT) and potentially, to be employed in Society 5.0 applications [5] . To further facilitate use on-site (i.e., in the field), portable optical spectrometers with a short focal length must be used. But as focal length decreases, spectral overlaps (often called spectral interference effects) arise. To address them, we employed Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Deep Learning approaches, thus (in many respects) making sensor-systems smarter [6] . In this paper (due to space limitations), emphasis will be will be placed on recent developments.

        <jats:p>This study contributes to identifying a valid and reliable set of barriers to sustainable solid waste management framework rooted in society 5.0 perspectives in Taiwan. In nature, the hierarchical structure is with the causal interrelationships under uncertainties. The perspective empowers the creation of a new biosphere based on technological progress, but in the sustainable solid waste management field, it is difficult to encounter and shape the systematized processes due to barriers and challenges. To address this shortcoming, this study evaluates the technical challenges faced in the field of sustainable solid waste management toward society 5.0. The valid attributes are usually described the qualitative information. The fuzzy Delphi method is applied to acquire the valid and reliable attributes. Fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory experiment is to visualize the causal interrelationships among the attributes. Choquet integral with respect to the nonadditive attributes over the valid set provides an overall perspective function. The results establish an understanding of sustainable solid waste management barriers in the perspectives under uncertainties. Community uncertainty, policy and regulation problems, city architecture, and technology interaction are the factors that influence sustainable performance. In practices, (1) diverse disciplines and sectors in local, national, and global communities, (2) a lack of mobility and reliability, (3) mass production and mass consumption, (4) an insufficient level of artificial intelligence application, and (5) failures related to data management and security hinder the improvement of sustainable solid waste management toward society 5.0.</jats:p>

A survey questionnaire was administered to 39 subjects consisting of students of Sultan Agung Islamic University Semarang enrolled in Basic Culture Course in order to grasp their profiles in terms of S (Strength) W (Weakness) O (Opportunity) and T (Threat) with respect to Islamic values and local wisdoms. It turns out that all students show their strength, namely being aware of the Islamic values and local wisdoms positively contributing to the success of the future career as soft skills. However, their weakness is that they master knowledge of Islamic values and local wisdoms only at cognitive level. In practice rules are violated. Opportunity is open for them since they are still at college with rooms for advancement and improvement. Meanwhile, the threat is that they may be influenced by the negative impact of cyber information providers within disruption of digital manufacture unless it is anticipated by equipping them with manifestation of Islamic values and local wisdoms to successfully survive in Society 5.0 in which people shall govern technology and not otherwise.

AB  - <jats:p>This chapter introduces advanced aluminum alloy matrix composites and their manufacturing processes. In the beginning, the state of the art is characterized and the general characteristics of aluminum and its practical applications are presented, starting with the history of aluminum. The current approximate distribution of bauxite resources in the world and the production of bauxite and alumina in the leading countries of the world, as well as the production of primary and secondary aluminum and the range of aluminum end products, are presented. Aluminum alloys intended for plastic deformation and castings, and composite materials in general and with a matrix of aluminum alloys in particular, have been characterized in general. Against this background, a detailed review of the results of the Author’s own research included in numerous projects and own publications on advanced composite materials, their production technology, their structure, and properties were done. The range of aluminum alloy matrices of composite materials was adequately characterized, which include AlSi12, AlSi7Mg0.3, AlMg1SiCu, AlMg3, AlMg5, and AlMg9, respectively. Composite materials tested in terms of manufacturing technology include three groups. The first group includes gas pressure infiltration with liquid aluminum alloys of suitably formed porous preforms. Porous frameworks as a reinforcement for pressure-infiltrated composite materials with a matrix of aluminum alloys are produced by three methods. Al2O3 powder with the addition of 30–50% carbon fibers is uniaxially pressed, sintered, and heated to thermally degrade the carbon fibers and create the required pore sizes. In the second case, the ceramic porous skeleton is produced with the use of halloysite nanotubes HNTs by mechanical milling, press consolidation, and sintering. A third method is SLS selective laser sintering using titanium powders. Another group of manufacturing technologies is the mechanical synthesis of the mixture of AlMg1SiCu aluminum alloy powder and respectively, halloysite nanotubes HNTs in a volume fraction from 5 to 15% or multi-wall carbon nanotubes MWCNTs in a volume fraction from 0.5 to 5%, and subsequent consolidation involving plastic deformation. The third group of analyzed materials concerns composite surface layers on substrates of aluminum alloys produced by laser feathering of WC/W2C or SiC carbides. The structure and properties of the mentioned composite materials with aluminum alloys matrices are described in detail. The chapter summary provides final remarks on the importance of advanced aluminum alloy composite materials in industrial development. The importance of particular groups of engineering materials in the history and the development of the methodology for the selection of engineering materials, including the current stage of Materials 4.0, was emphasized. The importance of material design in engineering design is emphasized. Concepts of the development of societies were presented: Society 5.0 and Industry 4.0. The own concept of a holistic model of the extended Industry 4.0 was presented, taking into account advanced engineering materials and technological processes. Particular attention was paid to the importance of advanced composite materials with an aluminum alloy matrix in the context of the current stage of Industry 4.0 of the industrial revolution. Growth in the production of aluminum, its alloys, and composites with its matrix was compared with that of steel. Despite the 30 times less production, aluminum is important due to its lower density. The challenges posed by the development in the Industry 4.0 stage, including the expectations of the automotive and aviation industry, force constant progress in the development of new materials with the participation of aluminum, including the composite materials with an aluminum alloy matrix presented in this chapter.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p> Industrial civilization transforms current cutting edge technologies and the evolution of Industry 5.0 is more aggressive with the use of IoT-enabled smart machines and robots in the manufacturing sector today. IoT technology deals with digital data as in additive manufacturing (AM). The potential and progressive aspects of AM embarks for functional part development instead of initial prototyping. AM is one of large-scale production with less buy-to-fly (BTF) ratio. In the present work, a novel framework has been proposed and utilized to attain adaptive bead modeling and an appropriate path plan for enhanced deposition and surface quality of weld beads. Further, the influence of input process parameters toward sustainable wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is also focused. Machine learning-based hybrid-TLBO (h-TLBO) and support vector machine (SVM) is deployed for the optimization process. With the aid of graph theory, weights are estimated for h-TLBO. The overall process parameters and entire data module is handled with IoT technology and can be accessed for processing. The simulated post-processing results are validated experimental test results and found to be in good concurrence. </jats:p>

AB  - Photonic crystal surface-emitting lasers (PCSELs) are an unprecedented type of semiconductor laser that can achieve single longitudinal- and lateral-mode oscillation even over areas of millimeters in diameter. Their brightness, defined as power per unit area per unit solid angle, is expected to be increased up to the range of 1～10GWcm-2sr-1, which is comparable to those of gas lasers and fiber lasers. Also, PCSELs have additional functions, including the generation of beams with various patterns and polarizations, and they can even achieve electric two-dimensional beam scanning. Material systems for PCSELs are currently being expanded to not only InGaAs/GaAs (900-1000nm), but also InGaAsP/InP (1.3-1.55um) and even InGaN/GaN (400-530nm). LiDAR is discussed as one example of the applications of PCSELs. PCSELs will become a key light source in the forthcoming ultra-smart Society 5.0, which includes smart mobility and smart processing.

AB  - <jats:p>Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are being used more and more in the industry to understand and optimize processes such as fluid flows. At the same time, tools such as augmented reality (AR) are becoming increasingly important with the realization of Industry 5.0 to make data and processes more tangible. Placing the two together paves the way for a new method of active learning and also for an interesting and engaging way of presenting industry processes. It also enables students to reinforce their understanding of the fundamental concepts of fluid dynamics in an interactive way. However, this is not really being utilized yet. For this reason, in this paper, we aim to combine these two powerful tools. Furthermore, we present the framework of a modular open-source library for scientific visualization of fluid flow “OpenVisFlow” which simplifies the creation of such applications and enables seamless visualization without other software by allowing users to integrate the visualization step into the simulation code. Using this framework and the open-source extension AR-Core, we show how a new markerless visualization tool can be implemented.</jats:p>

AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) that combine IoT (Internet of Things) and Cloud computation technologies are an emerging trend in Industry 5.0. Such systems could lead to a different manufacturing process closer to the current market needs. In addition, the factories can be more efficient, sustainable, and environmentally friendly. This work intends to explore a different approach to the manufacturing process, where there is no production planned behind and the shop floor is a provider of services for the products to be built. For that purpose, this paper proposes an executable model defining the interaction between the different actors and representing the digital counterpart of the CPS. We use a high-level graphical language to create the executable model that allows easy and flexible experimentation with different scenarios. Also, the model can be made as detailed as needed while providing a precise and readable simulation and a resulting detailed log amenable to further analysis.

AB  - Although manufacturing companies are currently situated at a transition point in what has been called Industry 4.0, a new revolutionary wave—Industry 5.0—is emerging as an ‘Age of Augmentation’ when the human and machine reconcile and work in perfect symbiosis with one another. Recent years have indeed assisted in drawing attention to the human-centric design of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) and to the genesis of the ‘Operator 4.0’, two novel concepts that raise significant ethical questions regarding the impact of technology on workers and society at large. This paper argues that a value-oriented and ethical technology engineering in Industry 5.0 is an urgent and sensitive topic as demonstrated by a survey administered to industry leaders from different companies. The Value Sensitive Design (VSD) approach is proposed as a principled framework to illustrate how technologies enabling human–machine symbiosis in the Factory of the Future can be designed to embody elicited human values and to illustrate actionable steps that engineers and designers can take in their design projects. Use cases based on real solutions and prototypes discuss how a design-for-values approach aids in the investigation and mitigation of ethical issues emerging from the implementation of technological solutions and, hence, support the migration to a symbiotic Factory of the Future.

AB  - <jats:p>Green innovation is an important way for enterprises to achieve high-quality economic development, and it is also the way to achieve the goal of double carbon. Green innovation has therefore become a research hotspot. With the acceleration of the digitalization process in equipment enterprises, intelligent manufacturing equipment enterprises located at the top of the industrial chain are in urgent need of green core technology innovation activities. In order to explore the internal mechanism of core green technology innovation, this research introduces reputation theory into the evolutionary game analysis process. By constructing an evolutionary game model between the government and intelligent manufacturing equipment enterprises, this research analyzes the dynamic factors that affect the selection and evolution of the main strategies of the players in the evaluation game. The results show that corporate reputation, core green technology innovation profit, government subsidies, government reputation, and the cost for the government to support core technology, among other factors, importantly affect the game between the government and the enterprises. At the same time, since both the government and the enterprises are affected by the initial state and the maximization of the interests of both sides of the game, it is difficult for them to spontaneously reach an ideal stable and balanced state through a virtuous circle. The greater the profits and the reputation premium the core green technology innovation brings to the enterprises, the more favorable it is for the enterprises to choose core green technology innovation; government subsidies within a certain range will also drive enterprises to choose core green technology innovation. When the value of enterprise core green technology innovation is low, the cost for the government to support core green technology innovation is lower, enterprises will lose more opportunities and decline in global competitiveness, and it will become more favorable for the government to evolve towards supporting core green technology innovation. On the contrary, the government will gradually transfer its tangible hand to the intangible hand of the market based on the consideration of subsidies, innovation costs, and reputation. The results of this research are intended to provide a theoretical basis and practical reference for Chinese intelligent manufacturing equipment enterprises to better achieve green core technology innovation.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract This chapter goes beyond simply defining terms by providing an overview of the entire technology and data ecosystem (within and beyond the food industry) so that readers are able to differentiate between Blockchain, cryptocurrency and ledgers, as well as smart contracts and the cloud. A deep look at disruptive technology and innovation in retail highlights the diversity of the future of food safety technology. Food systems and food supply chains (FSCs) have undergone significant changes in their operations and structure over the last decade as globalization expands both food choice and availability. As FSCs lengthen, and food passes through extended trading relationships, transparency on food origins, methods of cultivation, harvest, processing as well as labor conditions and sustainability are reduced, along with food trust. Moreover, while the rapid pace of technology innovation benefits FSCs, we are witness to the usage of social media platforms by citizen-consumers to amplify the rhetoric related to recurring incidents and crises in food quality, food safety, food fraud, food security, sustainability, and other ethical lapses. Furthermore, we are witness to new evidence on the global burden of foodborne diseases, including noncommunicable diseases that range from severe malnutrition to morbid obesity and from severe illnesses requiring hospitalization to mortality. The World Health Organization claims that 31 foodborne hazards cause 600 million illnesses and 420,000 deaths annually. Overcoming these challenges requires a holistic reframing of our food systems and societal challenges. The emergence of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provides an overarching framework for collaboration and alignment. Japan has put forward a vision for a human-centric, technology-enabled future branded as “Society 5.0.” Increasingly, the redesign of FSCs necessitates a concerted, multistakeholder effort and the development of digitization strategies in order to cope with the evolution toward the vision of Society 5.0 and to achieve the UN SDGs.

The choice of a "5.0" management of the territory, centered on people and criteria of sustainability : People remain central in making any decision. Whether they are decision-makers themselves or citizens, the different environments (economic, social, political, etc.) are directly impacted by humans. Through its choices and actions, it generates positive as well as negative developments. The sustainability of the territory must be understood, therefore, as the capacity to maintain human activities over the long term. Based on the principle of resilience and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, this 5.0 strategic management opens up a field of possibilities and innovations in the just governance of a territory.

AB  - The industrial revolution was able to solve various social challenges in society, which create a sustainable life and bring people to the uttermost advanced society, Society 5.0. In Society 5.0, a massive amount of data from the sensor will rapidly accumulate in cloud services. It requires enormous bandwidth and high-speed communication than can be achieved by using optical fiber as a transmission media. However, chromatic dispersion will limit the bandwidth and data rate due to pulse broadening, which needs compensation. Among many compensation techniques for optical fiber systems, this research investigates the effects of dispersion compensating fiber (DCF) in a single-mode-fiber (SMF) using a 10 Gbps bit rate at various source power levels. This research considers three different schemes of DCF, i.e., pre-compensation, post-compensation, and symmetrical compensation with NRZ modulation format at transmission distances up to 200 km simulated by using OptiSystem. The results show that the dispersion effect can be compensated by the proposed DCF scheme. Also, the use of amplifiers should be considered to compensate for the high attenuation effect of DCF. The system performance showed that using a three different scheme of DCF could provide a good system performance and reach a transmission distance of 200 km.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the role of innovation competitive advantage on strategic orientation dimensions of (entrepreneurial orientation, market orientation, and resource orientation) on the sustainable growth of SMEs. This study used a total of 217 responses adopting the cross-sectional survey research design from manufacturing SMEs owners/founders. The results were analysed using PLS-SEM via SmartPLS version 3.3.3. The major findings established that entrepreneurial orientation did not directly link with the sustainable growth of SMEs. The study confirmed that market orientation and resource orientation revealed a direct and significant positive link with the sustainable growth of SMEs. Similarly, innovation competitive advantage has a direct significant positive association with the sustainable growth of SMEs. Likewise, entrepreneurial orientation and market orientation have a direct and significant positive relationship with innovation competitive advantage. However, resource orientation did not significantly relate to innovation competitive advantage. The findings validated that innovation competitive advantage mediated the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation, market orientation, and the sustainable growth of SMEs. Finally, innovation competitive advantage did not mediate between resource orientation and sustainable growth of SMEs, which have not previously been proven in empirical studies. This study was designed to address the existing gaps and provide reasons to prove them. This study is indeed one of the remarkable studies in the context of SMEs, which integrates these selected variables into a single model. The originality focused on the role of innovation competitive advantage on strategic orientation dimensions and sustainable growth of SMEs that are relevant to Society 5.0.

AB  - The fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, is reshaping the way individuals live and work while providing a substantial influence on the manufacturing scenario. The key enabling technology that has made Industry 4.0 a concrete reality is without doubt <i>collaborative robotics</i>, which is also evolving as a fundamental pillar of the next revolution, the so-called Industry 5.0. The improvement of employees&#x2019; safety and well-being, together with the increase of profitability and productivity, are indeed the main goals of human-robot collaboration (HRC) in the industrial setting. The robotic controller design and the analysis of existing decision and control techniques are crucially needed to develop innovative models and state-of-the-art methodologies for a safe, ergonomic, and efficient HRC. To this aim, this paper presents an accurate review of the most recent and relevant contributions to the related literature, focusing on the control perspective. All the surveyed works are carefully selected and categorized by target (i.e., safety, ergonomics, and efficiency), and then by problem and type of control, in presence or absence of optimization. Finally, the discussion of the achieved results and the analysis of the emerging challenges in this research field are reported, highlighting the identified gaps and the promising future developments in the context of the digital evolution. <i>Note to Practitioners</i>&#x2014;The design and development of manufacturing systems are experiencing substantial changes towards full automation. This ongoing challenge is being tackled by academia and industrial practitioners with the adoption of collaborative robots, where the skills and peculiarities of humans (e.g., intelligence, creativity, adaptability, etc.) and robots (e.g., flexibility, pinpoint accuracy, tirelessness, etc.) are combined to better perform a variety of tasks. Nevertheless, due to their different characteristics, there is an emerging need for designing suitable decision and control techniques to ensure a safe and ergonomic HRC, while keeping the highest level of productivity. Against this background, the aim of this paper is to provide researchers and practitioners with a reference source in the related field, which can help them designing and developing suitable solutions to control problems in safe, ergonomic, and efficient collaborative robotics.

AB  - Purpose




There is an extensive research literature on servitisation and the related field of product-service systems that has emerged independently from different fields including engineering, management, design and environmental studies. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a structured literature review to explore, identify and synthesise the multi-disciplinary research challenges in the journey towards servitisation.




Design/methodology/approach




The research approach is a systematic literature review using key word searches and citation tracking for research reported between 1990 and 2013 in research databases that cover the fields which have generated the body of knowledge.




Findings




One of the key findings from the extant literature on servitisation is that it suffers from three fundamental weaknesses. First, numerous studies are conceptual in nature with limited practicality. Second, there are relatively few empirical studies, and often the findings relate to a single case study based on the insights of a limited number of senior managers. Third, often the dynamics are insufficiently studied in these organisations because data for most cases are collected post-event.




Research limitations/implications




Based on the literature review and its shortfalls, this paper proposes a holistic framework of eight themes that require further attention from academic researchers in order that a more complete conceptual understanding of servitisation is developed to support practice.




Practical implications




Each theme in the framework has an associated list of questions that can be addressed through research and presented to managers as a challenge agenda to improve their servitisation efforts. That servitisation is associated with differentiation and competitive advantage makes this a valuable approach for managing corporate performance.




Originality/value




Research from multi-disciplinary sources is synergised in order to develop an overarching servitisation agenda that transcends domain-based boundaries. This paves the way for an approach to servitisation that is coherent and harmonious.

AB  - <jats:p>Under the background of double carbon target and digital intelligence era, the innovation resources and innovation environment that manufacturing enterprises rely on have shown exponential growth. Digital green innovation (DGI) has gradually become the mainstream paradigm of innovation. How to achieve a balance between a local DGI network (LDGIN) and a remote DGI network (RDGIN) and how to use the role of digital empowerment and green organization flexibility to improve the performance of DGI are very important issues facing manufacturing enterprises at present. However, this problem has not been fully addressed in the existing research. In this study, the influence mechanism of LDGIN and RDGIN on the DGI performance of manufacturing enterprises was revealed, considering the moderating role of digital empowerment and green organization flexibility. The linear regression method was used to analyze the 562 valid data obtained by questionnaire survey. The results of this study are as follows. The effect of the DGI network on manufacturing enterprises’ DGI performance is heterogeneous because of LDGIN and RDGIN. The establishment of embedded links in a DGI network inevitably requires manufacturing enterprises to pay the corresponding costs. The over-embedding of manufacturing enterprises into RDGIN will have a negative impact on DGI performance. The balance between LDGIN and RDGIN has an important impact on manufacturing enterprises’ operation. The comprehensive balance and relative balance indexes constructed in this paper show that an appropriate balance can promote the improvement of the DGI performance of manufacturing enterprises. Digital transformation and organizational structure innovation are changing the business model of manufacturing enterprises and can regulate the relationship between the LDGIN and RDGIN and the DGI performance of manufacturing enterprises. The balance of DGI network embedding in practice shows the important role and enlightening significance of local and remote search in developing countries.</jats:p>

AB  - The present review retraces the steps of the industrial and agriculture revolution that have taken place up to the present day, giving ideas and considerations for the future. This paper analyses the specific challenges facing agriculture along the farming supply chain to permit the operative implementation of Industry 4.0 guidelines. The subsequent scientific value is an investigation of how Industry 4.0 approaches can be improved and be pertinent to the agricultural sector. However, industry is progressing at a much faster rate than agriculture. In fact, already today experts talk about Industry 5.0. On the other hand, the 4.0 revolution in agriculture is still limited to a few innovative firms. For this reason, this work deals with how technological development affects different sectors (industry and agriculture) in different ways. In this innovative background, despite the advantages of industry or agriculture 4.0 for large enterprises, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) often face complications in such innovative processes due to the continuous development in innovations and technologies. Policy makers should propose strategies, calls for proposals with aim of supporting SMEs to invest on these technologies and making them more competitive in the marketplace.

AB  - <jats:p> In the present era of technological advancement and rapid change, mankind faces different kinds of challenges. The product lifecycle has been shortened dramatically, and the manufacturing industry is moving from mass production to the high personalization of mass products. This era is widely known as the fourth industrial revolution or Industry 4.0 (I4.0). It seems that soon it will be inevitable for every society. The paper briefly focuses on empirical insights into the impact of I4.0 on various sectors of society. The traditional approaches to manufacturing, servicing, and public policy planning will no longer remain effective and would be transformed. I4.0 should be observed as an Opportunity 4.0 and draw attention to the industry, academia, and policymakers’ in changing scenarios. Expectations from them are also underlined. Its favorable features in the post-COVID-19 era are also discussed. This short article invites attention to foresee beyond I4.0, e.g. Industry 5.0 and more such progressions. </jats:p>

AB  - Abstract Driverless cars with artificial intelligence (AI) and automated supermarkets run by collaborative robots (cobots) working without human supervision have sparked off new debates: what will be the impacts of extreme automation, turbocharged by the Internet of Things (IoT), AI, and the Industry 4.0, on Big Data and omics implementation science? The IoT builds on (1) broadband wireless internet connectivity, (2) miniaturized sensors embedded in animate and inanimate objects ranging from the house cat to the milk carton in your smart fridge, and (3) AI and cobots making sense of Big Data collected by sensors. Industry 4.0 is a high-tech strategy for manufacturing automation that employs the IoT, thus creating the Smart Factory. Extreme automation until “everything is connected to everything else” poses, however, vulnerabilities that have been little considered to date. First, highly integrated systems are vulnerable to systemic risks such as total network collapse in the event of failure of one of its...

AB  - Developing technologies, advancement in science, evolving globalized perspectives and the massive dependence on digital platform for a routine sustenance has led to the core building of Industry 4.0. In general, industry 4.0 focuses on the metamorphosis of all industrial components with the help of strong digital support. It's very often interlinked with the successful fourth industrial revolution. It is to be noted that the very fourth outburst of industrialization plunges forward in order to achieve an optimized and sustained form of production. With the uplift of the fourth generation of this stirring revolution, the efficient extraction of advanced informatics analytics along with internetworked machines have grown to a great extent, complementing the digital platform. On the other hand, society 5.0 involves a human centric community which is capable of striking a balance between the economical proliferations and resolving societal liabilities by the core combination of cyber and physical space. Just like how industry 4.0 carries out the digital transformation of every industrial perspective, society 5.0 encourages mundane life to leap towards a digital revamp expanding across different tiers of the community. Indeed, the rapid change of information and Communication Technology along with the portrayal of society 5.0 as a global trend and a key aspect of the Science and Technology Basic plan, the interplay of the two proves to be a constant support for each other. This paper discusses about the future look of industry 4.0 and society 5.0 and elaborates on the challenges and opportunities rooted from them.

AB  - <jats:p>The construction industry’s inherent fragmentation fuels Construction Supply Chain (CSC) complexity. Logistics form an essential part of the CSC in terms of costs and project management. In turn, transportation accounts for more than half the logistics costs due to construction materials being low-cost/high-volume, and most other logistics processes being business processes and not physical ones. Construction transport is almost entirely road bound, one of the least sustainable modes with externalities far out of proportion to its numbers. Ergo, its optimisation presents substantial greening (de-carbonisation) opportunity, with potentially far-reaching sustainability impacts. The ASI (Avoid-Shift-Improve) concept considers activity, modal structure, and energy intensity/efficiency as transport carbon components, providing a fundamental optimisation framework. 93% of New Zealand’s freight (a third of it construction related) is road bound, with 99% fossil-fuel (diesel) dependence. Government adoption of ASI elements <jats:italic>viz</jats:italic> Supply Chain (SC) efficiency, transport optimisation, data/information sharing, and collaboration for transport decarbonisation aligns with Industry 5.0, but seeks further research for concrete implementation pathways. This paper aims to bridge the gap by proposing a research framework for greening of construction transport as a sustainability enabler for New Zealand.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p> Industry 5.0 is regarded as the next industrial evolution which is still on its infancy stage and under investigation phenomena. How shared economy can perform a superlative role in augmenting the corporate sustainable performance is another interesting gap that needs to be unveiled. This study investigates the linkage between shared economy practices and corporate triple bottom line (TBL) in three core streams—environmental performance (ENVP), social performance (SP), and economic performance (EP)—using empirical data. An additional factor of industry 5.0 (i5.0) technologies was treated as a moderator between shared economy and TBL. The findings assured the positive nexus of shared economy (i.e., contract manufacturing services, professional services, data entry &amp; clerical services, creative and multimedia services, sales and marketing services, software development services, and writing or translation services) on TBL (i.e., ENVP, SP, and EP). The positive moderating influence of i5.0 technologies was further affirmed between the relationships of shared economy and TBL. The findings yield multidimensional insights for operational management to adopt shared economy and i5.0 practices to improve corporate TBL in today’s competitive era. In addition, this study accentuates the notion of shared economy by providing positive evidence from developing nations. The study also highlights insightful implications for managers along with future avenues for the researchers to conduct additional multi-directional studies worldwide. </jats:p>

AB  - We present an empirical study to systemically estimate flooding impacts, linking across scales from individual firms through to the macro levels in China. To this end, we combine a detailed firm-level econometric analysis of 399,356 firms with a macroeconomic input-output model to estimate flood impacts on China’s manufacturing sector over the period 2003–2010. We find that large flooding events on average reduce firm outputs (measured by labor productivity) by about 28.3% per year. Using an input-output analysis, we estimate the potential macroeconomic impact to be a 12.3% annual loss in total output, which amounts to 15,416 RMB billion. Impacts can propagate from manufacturing firms, which are the focus of our empirical analysis, through to other economic sectors that may not actually be located in floodplains but can still be affected by economic disruptions. Lagged flood effects over the following two years are estimated to be a further 5.4% at the firm level and their associated potential effects are at a 2.3% loss in total output or 2,486 RMB billion at the macro-level. These results indicate that the scale of economic impacts from flooding is much larger than microanalyses of direct damage indicate, thus justifying greater action, at a policy level and by individual firms, to manage flood risk.

AB  - Visible Light Communication (VLC) is a short-range optical wireless communication technology that has been gaining attention due to its potential to offload heavy data traffic from the congested radio wireless spectrum. At the same time, wireless communications are becoming crucial to smart manufacturing within the scope of Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 is a developing trend of high-speed data exchange in automation for manufacturing technologies and is referred to as the fourth industrial revolution. This trend requires fast, reliable, low-latency, and cost-effective data transmissions with fast synchronizations to ensure smooth operations for various processes. VLC is capable of providing reliable, low-latency, and secure connections that do not penetrate walls and is immune to electromagnetic interference. As such, this paper aims to show the potential of VLC for industrial wireless applications by examining the latest research work in VLC systems. This work also highlights and classifies challenges that might arise with the applicability of VLC and visible light positioning (VLP) systems in these settings. Given the previous work performed in these areas, and the major ongoing experimental projects looking into the use of VLC systems for industrial applications, the use of VLC and VLP systems for industrial applications shows promising potential.

AB  - <jats:p>The article examines the influence of natural history and socio-cultural processes on the formation of industrial areas within the borders of modern Russia and partially the Russian Empire and the USSR. Basically, the evolutionary approach is used in the version of cyclic genetic dynamics. To assess the long-term effects of the “path dependence”, we analyze the 150-year cycle of industrialization within the borders of Historical Russia. To do this, we use the mechanisms of spatial localization of Kondratiev cycles and associated technological structures of the first (first-second), second (third-fourth)) and the third (fifth) industrial revolution. As an information base, data on the number of people employed and the volume of industrial production (in comparable prices) are used, and for the XX century, data on the dynamics of fixed assets of industry are also used. The relationship between modernization schemes on the old basis (within the boundaries of old industrial areas) and in the areas of pioneer development is revealed. The stability of industry specializations within the grid of industrial areas is considered separately. Based on the results obtained, the conclusion is made about the stability of old industrial cores of localization of industrial potential, the continuity of the spectrum of their specializations (not the replacement of old industries with new ones, but the addition). There is also a repetition in the regions of the new development of the General scheme of the chosen path and the inherited track.</jats:p>

AB  - As a fast-growing metropolitan, Jakarta is exposed by global flows consisting of ethnoscapes, mediascapes, technoscapes, financescapes, ideoscapes, and linguascapes. The flows increase diversity due to human contact across cultural boundaries that add complexity to Jakarta's society. Concerning the English language and culture classroom in Jakarta, the learners contribute to the diversity and bring in varieties of English language and culture. The learners are predominantly digital natives who earn English from games, media, and technology. On one hand, diversity becomes a competitive edge, though on the other hand diversity is the source of social capital in English language and culture classrooms in Jakarta. Giving room for the varieties is aligned with cosmopolitan pedagogy which allows dialogue of local diversities to ensure global community membership which is dominated by the global virtual community. The pedagogy has been put forward as a pathway towards intercultural communicative competence. Therefore, this study is interested to explore the trace of cosmopolitan pedagogy in the selected English classroom in Jakarta, Indonesia. Furthermore, this study shall reveal the reification of cosmopolitan pedagogy within the syllabus, teaching materials, language policies, and classroom practices. The result of this study shall put forward the pedagogy to nurture the digital native learners in Jakarta, Indonesia, to prepare the learners in virtual community which will dominate society 5.0.

AB  - The Industry 4.0 trend speeds up the adoption of a variety of technologies. In modern manufacturing, system data are collected both from the field through sensors and by exploiting complex simulations. Data analysis techniques became crucial to build and maintain any efficient production line, while autonomous systems and robots are the main focus of researchers and practitioners. This pervasive use of artificial intelligence derived technologies pushed humans to the border of production systems. Industry 5.0 aims at bringing the attention back to humans in production lines while magnifying their interactions with intelligent systems. This new trend will impact the design of future manufacturing infrastructures, increasing their complexity. Engineers will need modeling and developing tools able to capture this complexity. In this paper, we analyze the modeling languages and tools being used, identifying their strengths and weaknesses. Then, we propose some possible directions to provide engineers with the expressive power needed to tackle the challenges posed by Industry 5.0.

AB  - <jats:p>Science has become a center of knowledge that has contributed greatly to the development of technology. Almost all technology developed and created comes from research carried out on an ongoing basis and using a scientific approach. Science learning is currently developing and adapting to the needs of the times. The development of science occurs by utilizing collaboration with other branches of science such as technology, mechanical engineering, and mathematics. The distinctive feature of collaboration that has become an important value in IR 4.0 also occurs in the field of education. Big Data, as the hallmark of Society 5.0, is the source of big data that makes education more effective and efficient. In addition, the use of Education Technology (EdTech) can also support collaborative transportation and use of data. MEXT (2018) makes a leading project as a form of planning and compilation of science learning towards Society 5.0 through 3 important and essential steps, including: providing diverse opportunities and learning spaces to achieve “fair, individually optimized learning”, ensuring that all students acquire basic academic abilities such as basic reading skills, mathematical thinking, and information literacy skills, are not involved in the humanity or knowledge gap. The success of science learning can be supported by several branches of science such as Physics, Computer science, Natural science, Mathematics and modeling, Teaching and learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, STEM-based classroom management, Robotic and game teaching in science education, Instructional technology and application in science education, Training and professional development for STEM teachers, STEM curriculum in science education, Computer-based learning, Learning Innovations and Evaluation, Design and implementation of a technology-rich learning environment, Distance learning on education.</jats:p>

AB  - Constantly changing project environment and a new paradigm shift to a more human-centred and sustainable Industry 5.0 has also brought about a need for a new project management style. Over the last decades, more flexible and people-oriented agile project management (APM) approaches have emerged. Due to its many benefits, APM has already become a mainstream in software industry, and is now increasingly being transferred to other industry sectors. In this paper, we present some basic guidelines for manufacturing SMEs on how to increase their agility without having to undergo a complete agile transformation that requires high financial and non-financial resources. The guidelines are based on three key pillars: concurrent product development, APM, and modern technologies, and are focused on achieving both high project efficiency and stakeholders' satisfaction.

AB  - In the face of disruptive change, reaction time is an essential vector. Both linked to the organization and to all stakeholders, the different temporalities will define the capacity for an organization to be able to survive, adapt or control a constraint or change. This "Time To Action" will depend on several factors: the cognitive capacities of decision-makers to foresee a change, structuring of an information watch adapted to the understanding of all and vigilant internal processes open to the outside. An organization that controls information, its internal and external networks, ensures vigilant 360 ° governance. The choice of "5.0" Pilotage of the territory, centered on Human beings and criteria of temporal resilience : Temporal resilience should be understood as the ability to maintain the activity of the organization, regardless of the impacts resulting from a change. This 5.0 strategic management opens up a field of possibilities and innovations in the sustainable governance of organizations.

AB  - In the XX century, arises the mass production implemented by Henry Ford to overcome the period of crisis lived in the World. In 1988, the term Lean emerged and this philosophy successfully challenged the mass production implemented in the automotive industry, focused on customers’ requirements and satisfaction with the minimum use of resources and waste elimination. A Lean environment can be a promoter in the implementation of the fourth industrial revolution, named Industry 4.0 (I4.0). In the succession of Industry 4.0 emerged the Society 5.0 in Japan, as a strategy to deal with the impact of an ageing population. The focus of this quiet revolution is the humankind and the creation of conditions to promote a happy, motivated and satisfied society with more time for leisure and consequently increase productivity and wealth. This article presents a historical approach to the technological evolution of productive systems, and their influence on societies.

AB  - The strong current of globalization has driven the rapid development of the digital era and technology so that the term digital citizenship has emerged. The emergence of Society 5.0 era demands a balance between technology and the environment. But on the other hand, the emergence of the Society 5.0 era was not matched by the formation of digital ethics in society. The rise of cybercrime cases such as the spread of fake news (hoaxes), hate speech, and cyberbullying shows the lack of digital ethics in society. The formation of digital ethics is an important thing that must be done, one of which is through digital citizenship education in society. The method used in this research is qualitative with a case study approach. Data collection was carried out through observation and in-depth interviews with several main sources, namely the community board of Kampung Cyber and community members based on purposive sampling and snowball sampling techniques. The results showed that the emergence of the Kampung Cyber community became the main forum for the implementation of digital citizenship education in society, especially in shaping ethics. The application of norms in society becomes the main control for any deviant actions in the use of technology. It takes the development of competencies and digital ethical values that are in accordance with the era of Society 5.0, such as technological literacy, responsibility, honesty, critical thinking, problem solving, creativity, equality and local wisdom. The existence of a key figure as a model in social learning will shape people's behavior according to digital ethical competencies in the era of Society 5.0. In addition, it is necessary to create a good environment and strong ties in society that will encourage the successful formation of ideal and ethical digital citizenship in the era of Society 5.0.

AB  - <jats:p>In Industry 5.0, human workers and their wellbeing are placed at the centre of the production process. In this context, task-oriented dialogue systems allow workers to delegate simple tasks to industrial assets while working on other, more complex ones. The possibility of naturally interacting with these systems reduces the cognitive demand to use them and triggers acceptation. Most modern solutions, however, do not allow a natural communication, and modern techniques to obtain such systems require large amounts of data to be trained, which is scarce in these scenarios. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents KIDE4I (Knowledge-drIven Dialogue framEwork for Industry), a semantic-based task-oriented dialogue system framework for industry that allows workers to naturally interact with industrial systems, is easy to adapt to new scenarios and does not require great amounts of data to be constructed. This work also reports the process to adapt KIDE4I to new scenarios. To validate and evaluate KIDE4I, it has been adapted to four use cases that are relevant to industrial scenarios following the described methodology, and two of them have been evaluated through two user studies. The system has been considered as accurate, useful, efficient, not demanding cognitively, flexible and fast. Furthermore, subjects view the system as a tool to improve their productivity and security while carrying out their tasks.</jats:p>

AB  - Advancements in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) makes CPSs essential entities in society today, and have made them prominent across all fields. For example, the healthcare industry has evolved technologically and has effectively incorporated CPS into many application areas. While these advancements, involving Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS), have been revised according to Society 4.0, there are still issues that need to be considered while we transition from an information-based society (Society 4.0) to a human-centric society (Society 5.0). In this paper, we propose an MCPS framework for Society 5.0 in the context of some state-of-the-art technologies. The proposed system focuses on enhancing security aspects of Society 5.0 through introduction of a Security Layer equipped with protocols such as Open Authorization (OAuth), User-Managed Access (UMA), and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). The added security layer is designed to incorporate country-specific security laws. Challenges and design issues in developing a trusted and secure service for MCPS are also discussed using vulnerability assessment and attack modeling. Finally, we discuss ethical aspects that need to be addressed in the transition from Society 4.0 to Society 5.0.

AB  - This article focuses on the conceptual study of the blended learning model. This article also presents several studies from the online journal article and the findings of previous research from thesis and dissertations and textbooks relating to the theory of blended learning. As an effort to reformulate PAI learning, it is important to implement blended learning in the current digital era. Islamic religious education has a material source that is extensive and strategic for the progress of the Indonesian nation. With most Indonesia's population is the follower of Islam, Islamic religious education as millennial generation literacy is appropriate to be formulated under the development of digital technology. Islamic education can take a strategic role as the immunization of the young generation amidst the advancement of learning and innovation. Blended learning is one of them in future learning. Blended learning is one of the latest learning models that has been successfully applied to educational institutions. This study describes blended learning as an effort to reformulate PAI learning in the digital era 4.0. This study also aims to be a reference for further research. This research was conducted with the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method of various research findings and the findings of journal articles relating to the blended learning. The findings of the study showed that the principle of blended learning synergize a balanced combination between face-to-face and online learning. It can apply blended learning to PAI learning and is quite successful. Using technology will strengthen the conventional methods that commonly occur in PAI learning so that PAI learning is more effective and efficient. Some research states that blended learning has motivated students in learning, enables students to be more creative, more active, more participatory, more communicative, independent and able to solve problems in learning, improving learning outcomes. We can conclude it that the results regarding blended learning are having a positive impact on student development and also on learning outcomes.

AB  - The need to restructure, redesign or develop a management model on a scientific basis at domestic petrochemical enterprises in the context of the challenges of industry 4.0 and the prospects of industry 5.0, the transition to new management standards, the lack of qualified managers determine the importance and relevance of the problem of choosing the optimal organizational structure of enterprise management that contributes to the most effective achievement of goals. When designing and evaluating the effectiveness of organizational management structures, modeling was used using the production function, which takes into account the indicators of the use of human and material capital in the organization of production. The article summarizes the research and development that allows us to assess the current level of development of organizational structures of petrochemical enterprises in domestic and foreign science and practice. It is proposed to calculate the ranges of indicators of the effectiveness of the management system, depending on the type of organizational structure of management. As a hypothesis, it is noted that with organic types of organizational structures, the level of resource saving is higher than with divisional OSU, the level of resource efficiency of which, in turn, is higher than with mechanistic OSU. The scientific results presented in the study are of significant importance in the context of the implementation of projects on strategies for the development of organizational structures of petrochemical enterprises.

AB  - <jats:p> The introduction of collaborative robots aims to make production more flexible, promoting a greater interaction between humans and robots also from physical point of view. However, working closely with a robot may lead to the creation of stressful situations for the operator, which can negatively affect task performance. In Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), robots are expected to be socially intelligent, that is, capable of understanding and reacting accordingly to human social and affective clues. This ability can be exploited implementing affective computing, which concerns the development of systems able to recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affects. Social intelligence is essential for robots to establish a natural interaction with people in several contexts, including the manufacturing sector with the emergence of Industry 5.0. In order to take full advantage of the human-robot collaboration, the robotic system should be able to perceive the psycho-emotional and mental state of the operator through different sensing modalities (e.g. facial expressions, body language, voice, or physiological signals) and to adapt its behavior accordingly. The development of socially intelligent collaborative robots in the manufacturing sector can lead to a symbiotic human-robot collaboration, arising several research challenges that still need to be addressed. The goals of this paper are the following: (i) providing an overview of affective computing implementation in HRI; (ii) analyzing the state-of-art on this topic in different application contexts (e.g. healthcare, service applications, and manufacturing); (iii) highlighting research challenges for the manufacturing sector. </jats:p>

AB  - The future of industry 4.0 which is called industry 5.0 is the crossroads between information technology and operational technology, converging on physical and virtual systems that were previously used separately in industrial manufacturing processes with a focus of western culture. In other words, the supply chain uses technology to create integration between people, processes, and products. SMEs owners, manufacturers, and service organizations can access unprecedented, new levels of data, which can make it easy to understand, control, and improve every aspect of their operations. In the present study, existing research work on the models and assessment readiness criteria for the adoption of industry 4.0 are over-viewed. In I4.0, hybrid organizations are a type of organizations that have two wings of social and environmental mission and economic wing. The business models of these organizations have blurred the line between for-profit and non-profit organizations so that hybrid organizations can fall into both for-profit / non-profit categories. Hybrid Entrepreneurs Seek Organizational Organizations and Markets to Address Specific Social and Environmental Issues. The characteristics of these organizations are creating value for healthy living, environmental and social justice, environmental sustainability, quality products and services. In this paper we did research the development of a readiness assessment framework for tomorrow’s SMEs/hybrid SMEs or SME 5.0 which are small medium sized enterprises for getting prepared for the future concern for adopting the educational components of future of I4.0.

AB  - The relationship between urbanization and development remained a matter of concern for the policymakers since long ago. As per the 2014 report of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, life in urban areas is linked with higher levels of literacy and education, improved health, lesser fertility rates, and enhanced life expectancy with a greater access to social environment. Hence, increased movement of population is taking place from rural to urban areas. But this movement is increasingly leading to the creation of peri-urban areas around major cities with underdeveloped infrastructural facilities and compromised health and sanitation services. It calls for swinging into action right now and develops a realistic concept of smart cities in Society 5.0 that can ensure the optimum availability of clean air and water, healthcare systems, waste management, adequate supply of power and energy sources, efficient transport, ample parking facilities, etc. Precisely, Internet-of-things (IoT) devices such as sensors, lights, and meters need to be linked in a way that projected information gets automatically compiled and analyzed for further decision making to give value to the consumers’ purchase.

               <jats:p>The methodology of adult learning has changed significantly. Today, it is no longer possible to consider it a homogeneous group of trainees with a significant age difference. Different methods and tools are available to acquire knowledge. Digital technology, changes in time management, and changes in the way information is processed require new methods in adult learning. The acquisition of knowledge is necessary to enable workers to contribute to the digitization of the operating characteristics of production equipment and machinery in the context of Industry 4.0 and, on the other hand, to enable the combination of robotic and human skills to be launched in the 21<jats:sup>st</jats:sup> century through Industry 5.0. In our research, we examine the perspectives of adult education institutions, adult education professionals, and the people involved in adult education to ameliorate the use of digital technology in adult education as effectively as possible. We looked at the readiness and openness of institutions and trainers and the digital competencies and expectations of adult learning users of different generations. With our research, we got to know the situation of adult education enterprises operating in Hungary, in the Békés County, the needs and learning habits of different generations, and determined the directions of digital competence development in adult education.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Companies that believe in values will be successful in the long run. These core values will give spirit or motivation to everyone in the organization and finally to the community in growing a human-centered monotheistic society 5.0. This article aimed to examine the phases of implementing the Islamic value-based HR Model in companies. The model used was the HR model with Islamic values and the meaning of prayer, as well as a harmonious corporate culture, resulting in the expected HR performance. This study used qualitative research methods with the object of research are two companies that have implemented Islamic values in managing the company. The technique of collecting data was triangulation, namely research instrument,  in-depth interviews and secondary data analysis. Data analysis was inductive. The application of the Islamic value-based HR model goes through two phases, namely the "Mecca" phase and the "Medina" phase. Companies in the Mecca phase need to consistently carry out an integrated corporate culture internalization program, namely as values, decision-making patterns and attitudes. Internalization of culture by using Islamic values and the meaning of prayer to influence at the individual level, work units and companies in general can open hearts, minds and wills so that job satisfaction and employee commitment can be achieved. Companies in the Medina phase have shared values that have been entrenched and internalized which have an influence on HR performance. With the company's rapid development, culture as identity; fastener; a source of inspiration, pride and resources; driving force and as a pattern of behavior needs to be maintained and passed on to the next generation. </jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>The rise of the fourth industrial revolution aspires to digitize any traditional manufacturing process, paving the way for new organisation schemes and management principles that affect business models, the environment, and services across the entire value chain. During the last two decades, the generated advancements have been analysed and discussed from a bunch of technological and business perspectives gleaned from a variety of academic journals. With the aim to identify the digital footprint of Industry 4.0 in the current manufacturing ecosystem, a systematic literature survey of surveys is conducted here, based on survey academic articles that cover the current state-of-the-art. The 59 selected high-impact survey manuscripts are analysed using PRISMA principles and categorized according to their technologies under analysis and impact, providing valuable insights for the research and business community. Specifically, the influence Industry 4.0 exerts on traditional business models, small and medium-sized enterprises, decision-making processes, human–machine interaction, and circularity affairs are investigated and brought out, while research gaps, business opportunities, and their relevance to Industry 5.0 principles are pointed out.</jats:p>

               <jats:p>Managing a sustainable supply chain is a concept related to many areas of the economy. Its efficient functioning depends on the implementation of SDG activities and the development of industry (first-fourth/fifth industrial revolution). Due to the likelihood of different priorities in the implementation of the sustainable development goals, it is important to build such relationships, e.g. in the supply chain, so that their implementation could take place under similar conditions. Digitization, or the circular economy concept (CE), create an opportunity for the SME sector to build relationships as part of industry networks, for instance, where the managed supply chain would have a common and realistic goal to achieve. This goal will be a priority in business models based on sustainable development. The article presents the results of research regarding the furniture industry in Poland (key industry, referred to as smart specialization). The results of the analysis show that the industry has a large production potential, and the natural resources used in it are constantly increasing. However, there are doubts raised by the lack of stability in the dynamics of the sold production in the industry. Ultimately, the business model of the industry supply chain should focus on the environmental aspect (sustainable management of the raw material supply chain) and on eco-friendly consumption (sustainable management of the product supply chain), so that it can be managed in a sustainable way.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>The article considers the peculiarities of doing business in the COVID-19 pandemic. It is proved that with the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic the number of operating enterprises in Ukraine increased by 1,65%. At the same time, the number of unprofitable enterprises increased by 28,6%. Odesa oblast, Kirovohrad oblast and Kyiv are the regions most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine. It is determined that the loss of profits from the COVID-19 pandemic in large enterprises is 10-25%, and in small enterprises 25-50%. It is proved that the declining trend of profitability of operating activities of domestic enterprises accelerated further in the COVID-19 pandemic and reached 3,9% in 2020. Quarantine restrictions imposed in Ukraine led to the suspension of domestic enterprises, which faced additional problems. Among such problems are: the need to restructure the current business model of enterprises, reduce staff, increase production costs, reduce sales and other problems. It was found that smart companies did not face the problems of business organization and profitability under quarantine restrictions. Such enterprises timely fully "digitized" business processes based on modern information and communication technologies and other technologies of Industry 5.0; have high innovation activity; in the structure of the enterprise created its own research laboratory for the implementation of innovative developments; are energy and cost saving; constantly reduce the time of launch of a new product on the market, improve product quality. Examples of efficient and profitable domestic smart enterprises in various industries are given. For example, smart enterprises in the field of insurance increased the number of contracts concluded in Ukraine for compulsory civil liability insurance of vehicle owners in electronic form by 3,2 times compared to 2019; Retail enterprises increased the share of sales via the Internet by 2,1%, non-cash payments increased by 36% of the total retail trade in Ukraine.</jats:p>

AB  - The swings of global trade in recent decades have been resulted from the global economic crisis and unfavorable condition of global situation. Deterioration of private demand -- as a result of economic crisis and increase of unemployment – has been the main reason of worsening global trade. This condition has, of course, affected economic performance of countries through trade channels. Furthermore, the recent trade agenda following to Trump administration has created another uncertainty to the world economy. This paper studies the impact of new trade agenda, which is represented by Trump’s plan on trade policy, to the world economy as well as to Indonesian and Japanese economy in particular. The analysis is based on computable general equilibrium of GTAP model version 6, with two scenarios: (i) Trump Trade Agenda when implementing 45 and 35 percent tariff to China and Mexico; (ii) Trade Hit List when imposing tariff to the 16 countries in the trade hit list. Impacts of both scenarios are examined in short run and long run. The results suggest that both scenarios in the short run will not create any significant effect to global economy as whole nor to Indonesian and Japan in particular. However, their impacts to the global economy, Indonesia, and Japan will be substantial in the long run. Therefore, Indonesia and Japan in particular should concern on providing sound economic policies to reduce the risk of new trade agenda to these economies in the long run. Some policy recommendation provided in this paper are: (i) Japan should focus on improving technological innovation to realize the implementation of society 5.0 and industry 4.0 as scheduled; (ii) Indonesia should facilitate more investment to its economy and provide more government investment to induce accumulation of capital stock in the future. Furthermore, efficiencies and technological adoption should also be main concern of the Indonesian government to induce productivity of the economy and help mitigate the global risks in the long run.

AB  - Digital Twin and HMI for collaborative autonomous mobile robots in flexible logistics. The digital transformation is pervading our society, boosted by the development of new technologies and a lot of companies are undergoing radical changes, which apply both to products and processes, in order to comply with the requirements that the competition imposes. This thesis work has been drawn up during a collaboration for a project, whose specialization area is the smart factory, with Reply S.p.A. The title of this project is ICOSAF (Integrated COllaborative Systems for smArt Factory) and its leader is CRF (Centro Ricerche Fiat). In particular, its aim is to develop and integrate technologies for collaborative workspaces following the principles of industry 4.0 (interconnected automation) and industry 5.0, which is about humanization and re-use of resources. In the context of industry 4.0 the concept of Digital Twin is becoming more and more important. A Digital Twin is indeed an evolving way of simulating the historical and current behavior of a physical machine or a production process as an exact replica of the model it reproduces, since it is based on the same data, functionalities and communication interfaces, with the aim of optimizing it, validating it, monitoring it and hence preventing (taking actions against it) or reducing the risk of breakages, problems or errors that could occur. A simulated copy of the ICOSAF Use Case C has been implemented in order to have something to be integrated with the HMI that needed to be developed, too. Furthermore, as explained before, virtual environment carries a variety of potentialities to be exploited and hence it has been used in a predictive fashion: since production processes need to be performing, efficient, controlled and fast, this technology was used also to generate forecasts about possible errors or wastes, leading to higher performances and profit margin. As for the HMI, it is a layer between the user and the machine, process, device or system being controlled. It can be thought of as an interface which permits to interact with the objects listed before. HMIs are widely used in companies as advanced interfaces to control machines or systems, but industries which make use of this kind of system, exploits them for different reasons. Human Machine Interfaces, in fact, can display meaningful data, track production processes, time and machines consumptions in terms of energy, monitor machines input and outputs and so on. First of all, a brief analysis about the kind of device to be used as HMI has been conducted and this led to the result that for on field operators smart watches are the best choice, while for remote operators, tablets and PCs still represent the best selection. The required HMI has been then implemented in the form of a cross-platform web application, able to interact with the Digital Twin and with the robot/s simulated in it. From the integration of the developed systems, some interesting insights have been produced. It was possible, in fact, not only to verify that the solution proposed by ICOSAF was 1 actually correct, but to make some predictive considerations about possible future implementations of the same system in order to optimize it and pave the way for further improvements.

AB  - The world is heading in the wrong direction on carbon emissions where we are not on track to limit global warming to 1.5 °C; Ireland is among the countries where overall emissions have continued to rise. The development of wettable peatland products and services (termed 'Paludiculture') present significant opportunities for enabling a transition away from peat-harvesting (fossil fuels) to developing 'green' eco-innovations. However, this must be balanced with sustainable carbon sequestration and environmental protection. This complex transition from 'brown to green' must be met in real time by enabling digital technologies across the full value chain. This will potentially necessitate creation of new green-business models with the potential to support disruptive innovation. This timely paper describes digital transformation of paludiculture-based eco-innovation that will potentially lead to a paradigm shift towards using smart digital technologies to address efficiency of products and services along with future-proofing for climate change. Digital transform of paludiculture also aligns with the 'Industry 5.0 - a human-centric solution'. However, companies supporting peatland innovation may lack necessary standards, data-sharing or capabilities that can also affect viable business model propositions that can jeopardize economic, political and social sustainability. Digital solutions may reduce costs, increase productivity, improve produce develop, and achieve faster time to market for paludiculture. Digitisation also enables information systems to be open, interoperable, and user-friendly. This constitutes the first study to describe the digital transformation of paludiculture, both vertically and horizontally, in order to inform sustainability that includes process automation via AI, machine learning, IoT-Cloud informed sensors and robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and blockchain for cyber-physical systems. Thus, the aim of this paper is to describe the applicability of digital transformation to actualize the benefits and opportunities of paludiculture activities and enterprises in the Irish midlands with a global orientation.

AB  - Abstra ct — The development of the world of education is entering a very important period. Not only in an effort to provide quality and optimal education services. But it is also an important period that will determine the continuation of education itself. Today, the challenges in education are increasingly complex and require very serious preparation and thinking. We are faced with a rapid and non-linear change. This is as a result of the rolling of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 era. These technological advancements enable automation in almost all fields. As we know, the first generation industrial revolution was marked by the use of steam engines to replace human and animal power. The second generation, through the application of the concept of mass production and the use of electricity. The third generation, marked by the use of automation technology in industrial activities. In the fourth industrial revolution, it became a big leap for the industrial sector, where information and communication technology was fully utilized. The hustle and bustle of the Industrial Revolution 4.0, which was accompanied by the development of a disruption era, was suddenly shocked by the emergence of Society 5.0 (community 5.0). The concept of Society 5.0 has actually been rolling for a long time. This concept appears in the "Basic Policy on Economic and Fiscal Management and Reform 2016" which is a core part of the strategic plan adopted by the Japanese Cabinet, January 2016. The concept of Society 5.0 was adopted by the Japanese Government in anticipation of global trends as a result of the emergence of the Industrial Revolution 4.0. Society 5.0 is a natural thing that must have happened due to the rise of the Industrial Revolution 4.0. The Industrial Revolution 4.0 has given birth to various innovations in the industrial world and also society in general. Society 5.0 is the answer to the challenges that arose as a result of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 era accompanied by disruption characterized by a world of turmoil, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. Society 5.0 is a society that can solve various social challenges and problems by utilizing various innovations that were born in the era of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 such as the Internet on Things (artificial internet), Artificial Intelligence, Big Data (large amounts of data), and robots to improve the quality of human life. Society 5.0, a time in which human-centered societies balance economic progress with the resolution of social problems by systems that integrate cyberspace and physical space. Society 5.0 will balance economic development and solve social problems. Keyword — Society 5.0 will balance economic development and solve social problems. Abstrak — Perkembangan dunia pendidikan tengah memasuki masa yang sangat penting. Tidak saja dalam upaya memberikan pelayanan pendidikan yang berkualitas dan optimal. Tetapi juga masa penting yang akan menentukan kelanjutan pendidikan itu sendiri. Saat ini, tantangan dunia pendidikan semakin kompleks dan menuntut persiapan dan pemikiran yang sangat serius. Kita dihadapkan pada suatu perubahan yang cepat dan non-linear. Ini sebagai akibat bergulirnya era Revolusi Industri 4.0. Kemajuan teknologi ini memungkinkan otomatisasi di hampir semua bidang. Sebagaimana kita tahu revolusi industri generasi pertama ditandai oleh penggunaan mesin uap untuk menggantikan tenaga manusia dan hewan. Generasi kedua, melalui penerapan konsep produksi massal dan mulai dimanfaatkannya tenaga listrik. Generasi ketiga, ditandai dengan penggunaan teknologi otomasi dalam kegiatan industri. Pada revolusi industri keempat, menjadi lompatan besar bagi sektor industri, di mana teknologi informasi dan komunikasi dimanfaatkan sepenuhnya. Belum usai hiruk-pikuk akibat Revolusi Industri 4.0, yang dibarengi berkembangan era disrupsi, tiba-tiba kita dikejutkan dengan munculnya Society 5.0 (masyarakat 5.0). Konsep Society 5.0 sebenarnya sudah bergulir cukup lama. Konsep ini muncul dalam “Basic Policy on Economic and Fiscal Management and Reform 2016” yang merupakan bagian inti dari rencana strategis yang diadopsi Kabinet Jepang, Januari 2016.

AB  - The rapid evolution of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) is bringing drastic changes to society and industry. Digital transformation will create new values and is becoming a pillar of industrial policy in many countries. In anticipation of such global trends, “Society 5.0” was presented as a core concept in the 5th Science and Technology Basic Plan, adopted by the Japanese Cabinet in January 2016. It was identified as one growth strategy for Japan. Society 5.0 is also a core part of “The Investment for the Future Strategy 2017: Reform for Achieving Society 5.0” as part of its Fifth Science and Technology Basic Plan (FY16 to FY20), announced in April 2016, the Government of Japan aims to realize what it calls “Society 5.0,” or “Super Smart Society.” Society 5.0 provides a common societal infrastructure for prosperity based on an advanced service platform. The idea of progress has often been associated with modernity and social theory itself. In the bibliographical research carried out, as a curiosity the Wikipedia itself (in a consultation held on April 14, 2018) has referred to the concept of Industry 4.0, which raises interest worldwide in several, but it still does not have the concept of Society 5.0. In this paper, we can see that there is a lack of knowledge about the concept of Society 5.0. From a longitudinal perspective: “So, just what is Society 5.0? Taking a long view of history, I think we can define Society 1.0 as groups of people hunting and gathering in harmonious coexistence with nature, Society 2.0 as forming groups based on agricultural cultivation, increasing organization and Nation-building, Society 3.0 is a society that promotes industrialization through the Industrial Revolution, making mass production possible, and Society 4.0 as an information society that realizes increasing added value by connecting intangible assets as information networks. Society 5.0 is an information society built upon Society 4.0, aiming for a prosperous human-centered society.” Society 5.0 achieves a high degree of convergence between cyberspace (virtual space) and physical space (real space). In the past information society (Society 4.0), people would access a cloud service (databases) in cyberspace via the Internet and search for, retrieve, and analyze information or data. In Society 5.0, a huge amount of information from sensors in physical space is accumulated in cyberspace. In cyberspace, this big data is analyzed by artificial intelligence (AI), and the analysis results are fed back to humans in physical space in various forms. In the past information society, the common practice was to collect information via the network and have it analyzed by humans. In Society 5.0, however, people, things, and systems are all connected in cyberspace and optimal results obtained by AI exceeding the capabilities of humans are fed back to physical space. This process brings new value to industry and society in ways not previously possible. It is a presentation that is based on very recent publications, but which also has a prospective component, which always generates some in determination and uncertainty. Also, for this reason, it is a contribution that seeks above all else to contribute to this very urgent and necessary discussion.

AB  - Contemporary higher education is gradually transforming. Meetings of teachers and students from lecture halls are increasingly moving into the digital space of the Internet, adopting the formula of distance learning. The advent of Society 5.0 and Economy 5.0 will imply further changes. The necessity to integrate the real and virtual world, increased demand for information, limited time resources, and the need to combine professional work with education will cause higher education, in order to prepare future citizens to function in the area of sharing resources, to be forced to further adaptive transformations. The subject of this article is the analysis of the impact of technology on changes in higher education with an indication of the model of future paths of education in the Economy 5.0 trend. The source of the article was exploratory research of secondary sources, including books, articles, and reports, which were subjected to a critical analysis of the content. The obtained results made it possible to design and implement an explanatory study among students based on the CAWI methodology. The collected material became the basis for the authors to prepare a proposal for a model of future educational paths in accordance with the Economy 5.0 trend in which the flexibility of place and time, customization of the offer, cooperation, adaptability of teaching methods and instruments, and the proactive role of the teacher as a mentor and trainer constitute a set of set guidelines in the teaching model of the future. This model will be able to be used by universities and training institutions in the field of professionalization of the management of teaching and organizational processes.

AB  - Industry 5.0 follows the steps of the Industry 4.0 paradigm and seeks for revolutionizing the way industries operate. In fact, Industry 5.0 focuses on research and innovation to support industrial production sustainability and place the well-being of industrial workers at the center of the production process. Thus, Industry 5.0 relies on three pillars: it is human-centric, it encourages sustainability and it is aimed at developing resilience against disruptions. Such core aspects cannot be fully achieved without a transparent end-to-end human-centered traceability throughout the value chain. As a consequence, Auto-Identification (Auto-ID) technologies play a key role, since they are able to provide automated item recognition, positioning and tracking without human intervention or in cooperation with industrial operators. Although the most popular Auto-ID technologies provide a certain degree of security and productivity, there are still open challenges for future Industry 5.0 factories. This article analyzes and evaluates the Auto-ID landscape and delivers a holistic perspective and understanding of the most popular and the latest technologies, looking for solutions that cope with harsh, diverse and complex industrial scenarios. In addition, it describes a methodology for selecting Auto-ID technologies for Industry 5.0 factories. Such a methodology is applied to a specific use case of the shipbuilding industry that requires identifying the main components of a ship during its construction and repair. To validate the outcomes of the methodology, a practical evaluation of passive and active UHF RFID tags was performed in an Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV) under construction, showing that a careful selection and evaluation of the tags enables product identification and tracking even in areas with a very high density of metallic objects. As a result, this article serves as a useful guide for industrial stakeholders, including future developers and managers that seek for deploying identification and traceability technologies in Industry 5.0 scenarios.

AB  - Systems using 5G are expected to be used in various cases of Society 5.0 and Industrie 4.0 such as smart cities, smart factories, and also critical infrastructures. These systems are essential for our life, thus cyberattacks against the system must be prevented. In this paper, we tackle two problems posed by 5G features: system construction using multi-vendor devices and softwarized functions. Specifically, there are supply-chain risks that malicious devices are used in the construction phase. Moreover, the softwarized network functions are easy to be attacked compared to hardware. To cope with these problems, we propose a concept of architecture comprising a blockchain to record security events including supply-chain information and a tamper detection engine to ensure the integrity of software components in 5G system. We implement the initial prototype of the architecture and show its feasibility.

AB  - Several previous studies have shown that students have difficulty integrating ethnoscience into science learning. Students are more likely to be introduced to the basic concepts of ethnoscience without involving how to integrate ethnoscience into science learning. The impact is that students’ scientific literacy is low. This is what underlies researchers to apply the Local Wisdom Integrated Science (LWIS) learning model by using local Madurese content to train students’ scientific literacy. The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in student scientific literacy after implementing the LWIS learning model in ethnoscience learning with local Madurese content. The method used was pre-experimental study with one group pretest-posttest design. When the study was carried out in the even semester of the 2019/2020 academic year by taking 22 students via purposive sampling technique as a sample of all students in class 6A of science education, Trunojoyo University, Madura. Analysis of data using descriptive statistics and paired sample t test. The results showed that there were different in the scientific literacy of the students using the LWIS learning model before and after studying ethnoscience with local Madurese material. The entire LWIS syntax helps train students' scientific literacy by including self-awareness of the importance of local Madurese content as a learning context. Ethnoscience can be integrated into science learning through the STEAM approach. The contribution of STEAM to the LWIS learning model and self-awareness is very significant in developing ethnoscience learning for local Madurese content from elementary, middle, and tertiary level.

AB  - <jats:p>In recent years, the introduction of collaborative robotic solutions is constantly revolutionizing and innovating production processes by identifying new types of physical, cognitive, sensory, social and emotional interaction between user-operator and robot aimed at enhancing human capital. Starting from the preliminary study already realized on the different user-robot collaboration categorizations present in the literature (Formati et al, 2021), the new contribution, through the review of the still insufficient regulatory framework, ergonomic factors and robotic systems existing in the manufacturing field, returns the definition of further specifications about the collaboration modalities. In the current technological ecosystem, through the discipline of design is possible to prefigure and reinforce the collaborative processes through the introduction of new protocols and tools to support the regulatory standards, synthesis and evolution of the investigated categorizations, in order to optimize the production system as a whole and improve the working conditions of the operator with the robotic systems in terms of predictability, reliability, and usability.</jats:p>

AB  - There is a lack of a single architecture specification that addresses the needs of trusted and secure Artificial Intelligence systems with humans in the loop, such as human-centered manufacturing systems at the core of the evolution towards Industry 5.0. To realize this, we propose an architecture that integrates forecasts, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, supports collecting users' feedback, and uses Active Learning and Simulated Reality to enhance forecasts and provide decision-making recommendations. The architecture security is addressed as a general concern. We align the proposed architecture with the Big Data Value Association Reference Architecture Model. We tailor it for the domain of demand forecasting and validate it on a real-world case study.

AB  - <jats:p>Recently, the concept of Industry 5.0 has been introduced to complement, among other things, Industry 4.0’s focus on efficiency and productivity with a focus on humans in digital design and production processes. The inclusion of human interaction with digital realities, extended reality (XR) technologies, such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), can play an essential role in Industry 5.0. While rapid advances in XR technologies are solidifying and finding their place in the product and production development process, terminology and classification scheme remain under-determined. As a result, there have been numerous classifications of XR technologies from different perspectives, but little widespread agreement. They have been classified by their level of immersion or how well they meet a specific purpose (such as training). In addition to that, the classifications are usually made for one particular field (e.g. marketing, healthcare, engineering, architecture, among others). Therefore, to set the basis for future research, it is essential to identify and outline the dimensions that intervene in product and production design in regards to XR facilitated collaboration. With the ideas proposed in this paper, we want to identify basic concepts that classify a collaborative XR system by analyzing how users interact with the environment and other users. Our motivation is that collaborative design involves not only the physical dimension but also a social dimension. Defining when an XR system contributes to increasing social and/or physical presence could clarify and simplify its categorization.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Globalization and mass customization are commonly translated into increased levels of complexity in manufacturing systems. One of the main reasons is the increased number of variables, parameters, and interrelations on the shop floor. This intrinsic complexity can grow exponentially when considering the manufacture of large-size products with high levels of variability and variants: the mass production of large recreational motorboats with high levels of customization and low production volumes, mass customization. With the increasing role of sustainability and concepts of Industry 5.0, focusing not just on improving production systems but also human wellbeing, quick decision making becomes essential. Data and digitalization are becoming the cornerstone for system improvement, and digital data availability and analysis can facilitate the utilization of computerized tools to support decision making and maximize the performance of complex systems. For that purpose, simulation can be a powerful analytical tool to design, maintain, and improve complex manufacturing systems. Simulation techniques usually allow handling the size and complexity commonly associated with manufacturing systems. However, in systems with highly customized and large-size products, manual processes, and limited floor space, the implementation of simulation techniques is not straightforward, especially considering the aspects of variability, data collection, model validation, and system reconfiguration. With a particular focus on large-size products and limitations of a constrained existing facility layout, this paper presents the implementation of a simulation-based reconfiguration assessment considering manual production, assembly, and internal logistics requirements. Going through an industrial case study of large recreational motorboats manufacturing, the paper analyses the system analysis, data collection, implementation, and validation of the methodology step by step. Considering different what-if scenarios, the focus is on the capacity reconfiguration using Discrete-Event Simulation. The results can serve as a guideline for decision-makers and stakeholders working with complex mass customization manufacturing systems and space-constrained facility layouts.</jats:p>

               <jats:p>The news regarding Indonesian forest fire has become an international concern regarding its huge catastrophe. Indonesian citizens share the suffering of the disaster and their experience through the news. However, Indonesian media reports the news of forest fire in a different way related to their respective media agendas and the adoption of Industry 5.0 cultures. The study of news construction of mass media on forest fires is crucial because it relates to government policymaking. This research aims to determine the media agenda in constructing forest fires that occur in Indonesia related to the development of Industry 5.0. It applies a mixed-method of qualitative content analysis of published news during October 2019-January 2020 and newsroom ethnography of three national online news media. Media agenda-setting factors observed in univariate analysis are news focus, news sources, forest fire-prevention, the impact of a forest fire, and the event of a forest fire. This paper is a working paper and has not yet concluded the results because it needs further investigation on newsroom ethnography. However, preliminary findings indicate that there are different agenda-setting for each media studied.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>The object of the paper is peculiarities of digital economy development in the framework of informatization of socio-economic, socio-cultural relations. It contributes to the in-depth development of the noosphere, the emergence of new industries and a qualitative transformation of production and distribution relations. The paper examines the impact of digitalization on transformational changes in the economy. As noted at the 14th G20 Summit, the main goals of digitalization are the development of innovations, focused on the development of society 5.0, ensuring the free flow of data and at the same time solving problems, related to information security and the protection of intellectual property rights, as well as bridging the digital gap and promoting the digitalization of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and the development of smart cities.&#x0D;
The research methodology is based on theoretical and methodological analysis of the literature, statistical, comparative analysis, as well as synthesis, generalization and systems analysis.&#x0D;
The study has revealed differences between the national approach and world experience in the interpretation of digitalization. For instance, in Ukraine the phenomenon involves, first of all, «digitization» in the field of data collection and analysis. At the same time, the concept of digitalization in developed countries is considered as the modernization of the manufacturing sector based on the implementation of information and communication technologies in order to reduce the capital and material intensity of products to increase competitiveness. In addition, the level of development of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) as one of the indicators of the information society has been analyzed. As a result, it was found, that about 80 % of all central banks in the world have been working on projects to issue their own digital currency. The basic requirements for national CBDC have been systematized.&#x0D;
The practical significance, presented in the paper, lies in making recommendations for policy implementation of national economy digitalization. It is important, first of all, to «digitize» the real manufacturing sector, but not only create all sorts of «remote access services», clearly define the government position on cryptocurrencies and continue to implement the project of e-hryvnia (digital currency of National Bank of Ukraine) introduction.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>The increasing skill mismatch in manufacturing workforce is raising demand for training opportunities to cope with advanced manufacturing systems. To maintain production and adjust quickly to technological transformation, innovative work-based learning approaches are emphasized. Intelligent machines are becoming capable of interaction and collaboration with humans. They not only introduce a new type of learnable workforce to manufacturing but may open opportunities to enhance learning of all learners. Symbiotic relationships of humans and machines have wide potential for human-centric manufacturing (aka Industry 5.0). Moreover, connecting smart devices and deploying self-learning solutions is envisioned to increase flexibility of manufacturing, thus changing work division between humans and machines. Where humans and machines collaborate, the term Reciprocal Learning has been coined to describe the process of bidirectional learning. While a definition of Reciprocal Learning exists the boundary conditions of the concept are still ambiguous. In this paper, a framework for Reciprocal Learning in Human-Machine Collaboration for Industry 5.0 is presented to clarify what it is and what it isn’t. The approach is based on a multi-agent system perspective, comprising human and machine agents. Finally, an outlook on future research is presented.</jats:p>

As research methods, analysis and synthesis of current world trends were applied, as well as special methods were used: expert assessments of international organizations were analyzed, a comparative and economic-statistical analysis was carried out. As a result, the distinctive features of Industry 5.0 are highlighted – this is the coexistence of industry and new social and environmental trends and needs. Change is inevitable: green energy and sustainable products will initially be a monopoly factor and benefit insiders. It is emphasized that in order to achieve global competitiveness, companies need to transform established business models and invest in technology and network forms of business, taking into account social goals: in addition to creating new jobs and ensuring flexible employment, we are talking about personalization of goods and greening. The poli¬tical and economic goals of the fifth industrial revolution and the direction of technological innovations are considered. It is emphasized that technology, according to the new approach, should serve people and society, which means that the technology used in production adapts to the needs and diversity of industry workers. The leaders are artificial intelligence, quantum information and semiconductors. Technological transformation is based on the development of the following areas: individual technologies for human-machine interaction, biotechnology and smart materials, artificial intelligence, digital twins, data transmission, storage and analysis technologies, as well as energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, storage and autonomy. It is an ecosystem-based innovation policy with a flexible focus on results. It is noted that technological transformation will help solve a number of unique social problems. It puts a bold focus from individual technologies to a system approach that allows the industry to achieve social goals beyond job creation and growth, and puts the well-being of industry workers at the center of the production process. In conclusion, the techno-social nature of the fifth revolution is revealed, with technology as tools and social needs as the ultimate goal.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>The last 20 years have brought significant developments to digital fabrication technology, known as additive manufacturing (3D printing), and it has finally started to shed its prototyping mantel in favor of an industrial one. Yet its innovations are in danger of being subsumed into existing commercial practices, as society arguably continues to underestimate its ability, in conjunction with data collection, analysis, and communication tools, to disrupt current systems and enable a more equitable distribution of manufacturing wealth, capability, and capacity. This chapter highlights the potential of emerging industrial technologies to support a shift towards a more human-centered, responsible society where social and environmental problems are addressed through systems that maximises cyberspace and physical space integration, through the reframing of higher education engineering curriculum and pedagogy for manufacturing in Society 5.0. </jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Project-based learning has importantly helped to transform engineering education over the last decades, as it has been increasingly applied worldwide, as a fundamental methodology for shifting to student-centered engineering programmes. To enlighten the transition from Industry 4.0 to Society 5.0, and from Engineering Education 4.0 to Engineering Education 5.0, project-based learning (PBL) methodologies should also evolve. In terms of focus and topics selected for the PBL experiences, it is necessary to put forward the relevance of global challenges and to nurture a compromise for sustainability and ethical behaviour, while bringing students as close as possible to real multifaceted engineering problems. As regards connections with other educational methodologies, PBL and service learning (SL) are bound to hybridization and may benefit from innovative approaches, like the use of flipped classrooms, the promotion of gamification or the support of online resources and e-/b-/m-learning tools and methods. Complete PBL experiences will also synergize with and contribute to open-source engineering movements, like the “makers” movement, and will benefit from open software and hardware tools for increased educational equity. This chapter analyses and discusses trends in PBL methodologies, in connection with these new industrial and educational paradigms.</jats:p>

AB  - Over time, industrial revolutions have marked human existence and the work environment, impacting efficiency, effectiveness, and productivity. In the new promoted concept, Industry 5.0, it is expected that humans interact with robots, known as cobots, in a collaborative working space using innovative technologies. This chapter brings some new insights on the way the components of Industry 5.0 readiness model influence value added reported by countries, for the period between 2017 and 2019, on four levels of analysis, namely: (i) country gross value added; (ii) environmental activities value added; (iii) ICT sector value added; (iv) labour productivity. Our results prove that selected components of the Industry 5.0 readiness model determine a positive marginal effect on the value added reported by countries. We also registered a significant influence on the development of the circular economy, in strong relation with the development of the knowledge economy. This highlights the fact that the results of the research are efficiently implemented on manufacturing operations by highly skilled employees, leading to increase firms’ performance, improving at the same time the cooperation between humans and smart machines, as stated in the Industry 5.0 framework.KeywordsHuman-centric approachSustainable developmentIndustry 5.0Economic assessmentResilienceFactor analysisReadiness IndexEnvironmental value addedLabour productivity

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the current situation of China's local valve industry, the maturity of intelligent manufacturing and the way to promote intellectual development.,Firstly, a macro analysis of the valve market environment from the domestic and international perspective was conducted. Secondly, online surveys and in-depth interviews were administered to understand the current status of IM development and future development goals. Finally, case studies were conducted to demonstrate whether the hypothesis of the development approach is feasible.,This study finds that the overall maturity level of the local valve industry is still in the planning stage since the local valve industry lacks concentration and is relatively scattered. In addition, the feasible development approach is dependent on smart devices to improve production efficiency, ensure quality management and effectively control costs.,The research is conducted and focused on the Yangtze River Delta region instead of the whole country, and the size of the sample is small. Therefore, there may be some characteristics omitted in the analysis.,Manufacturers can upgrade to smart manufacturing through intelligent software platforms in order to complete an automatic interaction of data and devices. In addition, manufacturers should complete cross-regional collaborative development through the industrial Internet of things.,There is little or none of research work completed for the development strategy of the valve industry internationally. Therefore, research findings of this area can provide a fundamental understanding of China's local valve industry and contribute to the existing knowledge.

AB  - AbstractDue to climate changes and other socio-economic and anthropogenic in the world there is surgency in the epidemics and pandemics. Malaria is one of the oldest pandemics and still causing numerous deaths. Normally there is surge in the cases once the rainy season comes and it continues little over the rainy season. Normally multi-regression analysis-based empirical models have used to model the incidence and the rainfall, temperature, and relative humidity. Though the models developed were useful for public health departments, they often gave less accurate results than desired, and a need was felt to explore data science for a non-parametric solution. In this study we employed machine learning-based approaches and evaluated the results. The data came from Sundargarh District of the province of Odisha, India. Climate data used in the study include (1) block-wise station rainfall (RF) observation data, (2) gridded surface temperature (T2) data, and (3) Relative humidity (RH) data. High resolution gridded (with a horizontal resolution of 0.1°) ECMWF reanalysis land (ERA5-Land) data were used for observed temperature and relative humidity. The rainfall data was sourced from the Special Relief Commissioners’ web portal in Odisha. Malaria incidence data were collected from the state's Directorate of Public Health. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and J48 algorithm of Machine Learning were used to successfully predict malaria incidents. The two techniques’ performance evaluation was done using the classifier accuracy, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Kappa, and ROC scores. Classifier techniques such as the tenfold cross-validation and Percentile split (66%) and user-defined test options were used to divide the data into a training set and testing set. The study found out that the prediction accuracy in tenfold cross-validation with J48 decision tree classifiers was generally higher than the MLP. The results were encouraging, especially for the potential utilization of the model to predict future malaria incidence with higher confidence with access to weather forecasts. It was established that there is a medium-level malaria incidence in Odisha during periods of low rainfall, medium temperature, and lower relative humidity. Medium rain, high temperature, and low relative humidity are also associated with medium cases of malaria. Also, high temperatures, higher rainfall, and low relative humidity are characterized by a medium level of malaria incidence. Most importantly, it was established that high malaria incidence is associated with high or medium rainfall, low or medium temperature, and medium or very high relative humidity.KeywordsMachine learningMultilayer perceptron (MLP)J48 algorithmSpatial epidemiologyGIS for healthClimateHealth

AB  - <jats:p>Purpose: Despite the significant attention that Industry 4.0 (I4.0) has gained in the last decade, little importance has been given to shop-floor workers' role in effectively implementing these new technologies in production systems. Nowadays, several authors discuss the need to bring workers back to the center of the decision-making about implementing the new technologies in what is being called Industry 5.0 (I5.0). A key factor of using these new concepts is that it must make sense, and the new information generated by these technologies must have a precise use; otherwise, it will be considered waste. The Lean approach is already recognized as the best approach to identify and eliminate waste from production systems. Not only that, but it allows decisions about process improvement to be human-centric. Thus, this article aims to present the main aspects and evolution of I4.0 and I5.0 over time, using the Lean approach as the analysis lenses.&#x0D;
Study design/methodology/approach: In order to identify the mains aspects of I4.0 and I5.0, we develop a consistent literature review using the Systematic Search Flow (SSF).&#x0D;
Findings: As a result, it was possible to identify the evolution from I4.0 to I5.0, In I4.0, the main focus was on developing new technologies, combine them with classic Lean tools (e.g. Kanban 4.0, Poka-Yoke 4.0) and implement Cyber-Physical Systems. In I5.0, the focus is to use these new technologies together with shop floor workers to continuously improve production processes. Not only that, but in I5.0, the protagonist becomes (or return to become) the shop floor workers to lead the improvements, as is in the Toyota Kata approach.&#x0D;
Originality/value: This work presents a new way of interpreting the progression of concepts from I4.0 to I5.0. In addition, the focus on workers for problem solving is returning to the center of the discussion. Together with the technologies of I4.0, this represents a new area for future research.</jats:p>

AB  - Technology is composed of the words “Techne” and “Logos” that refer to the artistic/creative and the logical/scientific aspects of its dualism. And so inherent this Promethean concept lie the concepts of the Schumpeterian creative destruction and also the promise and potential for humanity’s better tomorrows. We live in an era of artificial intelligence–driven as well as viral disruptions that challenge the mind as well as the body. At the same time, the impact of our pursuit of prosperity at any cost on the environment triggers displaced people floods and viral pandemics undermining the standard of living and more importantly the foundations of trust in institutions and in a better tomorrow feeding populist movements and autocratic trends in democracies as well as emboldening dictators. This work discusses the concepts of Risk Management 5.0, Industry 4.0, Industry 5.0, Society 5.0, Digital Transformation, Blockchain, and the role of AI via the Internet of Things architectures that could enable “smarter as well as more humane solutions to our challenges.”

AB  - For an understanding of the concept of the Quadruple and Quintuple Helix Innovation Systems, it is essential to realize that the Quadruple and Quintuple Helices are based on democracy and ecology. This has two implications: (1) the further advancement and evolution of knowledge and innovation are requiring a co-evolution with democracy or knowledge democracy, and (2) ecology, ecological sensitivity, and environmental protection are a necessity for the survival of humanity, but they should also be regarded as drivers for further knowledge production and innovation development. This implies that for an innovation system to be a Quadruple and Quintuple Helix Innovation System, the government and the political system, addressing the innovation system, must be democratic in substance, and not only in form. This indicates how a Quadruple and Quintuple Helix differs from Triple Helix approaches to innovation. Furthermore, within the framework of Quadruple and Quintuple Helix, the “Democracy of Climate” for innovation and the “Democracy of Knowledge” are combined together in creating a nexus. Implications for strategy, policy, and practice are manifold, also incorporating aspects of Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0.

AB  - Purpose: this article includes the review of the Japanese policy on the national economy Digital Transformation, using the case of implementation of artificial intelligence for production and services, description and analysis of the current results, as well as identification of obstacles to achieve the expected results. Methods: the article is based on the analysis of scientific and analytical materials to the problem of research. The factual basis is the framework documents of the Cabinet of Japan, media, reports on research conducted by Japanese research institutes. Results: the article provides a brief review and analysis of the Japanese public policy of the development of AI technology, summarizes the interim results of the measures taken, identifies problematic factors that prevent the achievement of the expected results. The hypothesis is put forward about the insufficiency of government efforts to monitor and analyze the activities already implemented, the lack of practice of taking into account failures in the formation of new programs and projects. Recently, significant attention to the development of AI technology is paid in Russia. In 2019, Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the "National strategy for the development of AI until 2030". It is expected that the using of digital technologies, will increase the competitiveness of the national economy, improve the welfare of society. In this regard, the study of Japan's experience as one of the technological leaders in the development and using of digital transformation, is especially important. Conclusions and Relevance: To solve the current socio-economic problems, Japan government relies on the development of the advanced technologies. At the same time, the government continues to develop measures to stimulate the cooperation of the academic and industrial sectors to conduct joint R&D on priority technologies. However, due to the "closed" nature of Japanese corporations and the relative independence of government plans in determining the technological priorities development, the corporate sector is reluctant to follow government recommendations on the using new technologies in management and production processes, as well as joint projects with the academic sector are not large-scale and are rather formal. This situation indicates the continuing unpreparedness of key NIS participants for the perception of the advanced technologies and digital transformation.

AB  - <jats:p>Industry 4.0 is moving forward under technology upgrades, utilizing information technology to improve the intelligence of the industry, whereas Industry 5.0 is value-driven, aiming to focus on essential societal needs, values, and responsibility. The manufacturing industry is currently moving towards the integration of productivity enhancements and sustainable human employment. Such a transformation has deeply changed the human–machine interaction (HMI), among which digital twin (DT) and extended reality (XR) are two cutting-edge technologies. A manufacturing DT offers an opportunity to simulate, monitor, and optimize the machine. In the meantime, XR empowers HMI in the industrial field. This paper presents an XR application framework for DT-based services within a manufacturing context. This work aims to develop a technological framework to improve the efficiency of the XR application development and the usability of the XR-based HMI systems. We first introduce four layers of the framework, including the perception layer with the physical machine and its ROS-based simulation model, the machine communication layer, the network layer containing three kinds of communication middleware, and the Unity-based service layer creating XR-based digital applications. Subsequently, we conduct the responsiveness test for the framework and describe several XR industrial applications for a DT-based smart crane. Finally, we highlight the research challenges and potential issues that should be further addressed by analyzing the performance of the whole framework.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>The Internet of Things (IoT) has been implemented by multiple manufacturing companies into their production chain as this technology is the main source of digitalization in a production plant. It improves the data assembling, productivity of the operation, communication efficiency, and overall manufacturing performance. IoT is also serves to be a good means for improved and efficient warehouse automation. It makes the delivery of products more efficient by calculating the least routes and also reduces the time that is consumed during the management of inventory. The basic objective of Industry 4.0 is to lessen the participation of human operators and to emphasize the automation systems. However, this objective has changed in Industry 5.0, which aims to achieve the maximum benefits through the human–machine interaction by maintaining a balance. Industry 5.0 aims to strengthen the interaction between ever-increasing powerful machinery and the productive abilities of human beings. This paper introduces a detailed overview of IoT in enabling digital transformations and Industry 4.0. The authors have discussed the application of IoT in different industrial sectors, and how the concept of IIoT has evolved. In addition to this, the present paper highlights several research studies that enable the authors to elicit the major challenges, implementation analysis, and future scope of IIoT.</jats:p>

AB  - It is widely accepted that the advent of robotics and automation in previous industrial revolutions brought about paradigm shifts in the manufacturing industry worldwide. It is therefore conceivable that the fifth industrial revolution will bring about a similar shift in norms and make fundamental changes in our approach to industry and manufacturing. From the first industrial revolution to the fourth, science and technological innovations, training and capital, were the key elements in evolving how products are conceived, designed and manufactured. Looking forward to the fifth industrial revolution it is likely that there will be a paradigm change in how industry will evolve given the tools of industry 4.0; the internet of things, digitization, blockchain, advanced materials, additive manufacture, artificial intelligence and robotics, drones, energy technology, biotechnology, neurotechnology and virtual and augmented reality.

AB  - Osamu Tezuka is known as a pioneer of modern manga. His works such as Tetsuwan Atom, Black Jack, and Kimba The White Lion have been translated into various languages and have received many prestigious awards in the field of comics. In 1989, Tezuka passed away, leaving a cultural legacy not only for manga but also for the comics world. Phaidon is a manga created under the name of Tezuka and published in 2020. The interesting thing about Paidon is that its creation was done by Artificial Intelligence and staff from Tezuka Pro. This process is relatively new in comics because, generally, comics are made by an artist/group. This research focuses on Paidon as a case study to build a model of how visual idioms are constructed. The method used is the visual analysis by Gillian Rose, which covers aspects of production, image, and audience, where each aspect includes technological, compositional, and social modalities. This study concludes that the preservation of deceased artists required capable human resources to mimic the visual language; the AI took the role of a production apparatus. This might be one production method in the future. However, without the capabilities of human resources, Paidon would not achieve a maximum visual approach.

AB  - <jats:p>Quantum Mechanics is a branch of science that describes the interactions between photons and electrons. Quantum science completed more than 100 years of existence with pioneers research made by Max Planck to explain black body radiation. This theory, historically speaking, is new by comparison with classical physics. However, quantum physics is revolutionary. It adds novel scientific concepts about our universe and the atomic world, breaking some existing concepts of Isaacs Newton’s Laws in classic physics and Pierre Laplace’s calculus. Contribution for the quantum mechanics provided by notorious scientists such as Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein paved the way for quantum computation and quantum communications. Nowadays, quantum mechanics are being engineered to quantum technologies to start a new scientific revolution and perhaps move our society for Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0. It is known that by 2030 the Big Data will be even more prominent with the number of devices connected to the Internet. Therefore, it is vital to engineering a 6G Radio that is cognitive, fast to predict events, and prevent incidents. For this, 6G Radio must have Artificial Intelligence operating with machine learning with the combined quantum computer superpower to process and harness the incommensurable amount of big data in favor of excellent service level agreements (SLAs) and Quality of Experience (QoE). Thus, this is the proposal of this study presented here.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Resilient manufacturing is a vision in the Industry 5.0 blueprint for satisfying sustainable development goals under pandemics or the rising individualized product needs. A resilient manufacturing strategy based on the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks plays an essential role in facilitating production and supply chain recovery. IIoT contains confidential data and private information, and many security issues arise through vulnerabilities in the infrastructure. The traditional centralized IIoT framework is not only of high cost for system configuration but also vulnerable to cyber-attacks and single-point failure, which is not suitable for achieving the resilient manufacturing vision in Industry 5.0. Recently, researchers are seeking a secure solution of middleware based on blockchain technology integration for decentralized IIoT, which can effectively protect the consistency, integrity, and availability of IIoT data by utilizing the auditing and tamper-proof features of the blockchain. This paper presented a review of secure blockchain middleware for decentralized IIoT towards Industry 5.0. Firstly, the security issues of conventional IIoT solutions and the advantages of blockchain middleware are analyzed. Secondly, an architecture of secure blockchain middleware for decentralized IIoT is proposed. Finally, enabling technologies, challenges, and future directions are reviewed. The innovation of this paper is to study and discuss the distributed blockchain middleware, investigating its ability to eliminate the risk of a single point of failure via a distributed feature in the context of resilient manufacturing in Industry 5.0 and to solve the security issues from traditional centralized IIoT. Also, the four-layer architecture of blockchain middleware presented based on the IIoT application framework is a novel aspect of this review. It is expected that the paper lays a solid foundation for making IIoT blockchain middleware a new venue for Industry 5.0 research.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Era society 5.0 merupakan kelanjutan dari era revolusi industri 4.0 yang lebih menonjolkan sisi humanisme dalam menyelesaikan masalah-masalah sosial termasuk pendidikan dengan mengintegrasikan antara virtual dan realita. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menganalis kebijakan pemerintah tentang pengembangan guru di era society 5.0 dengan mengunakan sumber data atau referensi yang berupa buku, jurnal, prosiding dan lain-lain yang secara umum disebut library research. Terdapat beberapa kondisi dan penyebab dari rendahnya kualitas profesi guru, antara lain:  1) Belum tercapainya standarisasi kualifikasi akademik guru minimal D4/S1 sebagaimana tercantum dalam Permendiknas Nomor 16 Tahun 2007, 2) Pengembangan kompetensi guru yang seringkali terhambat karena faktor internal dan eksternal, 3) Rekrutmen guru yang tidak efektif,4) Kesejahteraan guru berupa penghasilan yang masih sangat kecil dan tidak sebanding dengan tugas guru sebagai pembentuk watak dan peradaban manusia.Walaupun kebijakan-kebijakan strategis dari pemerintah yang berkaitan dengan keempathal tersebut sudah ada, namun implementasinya masih sangat kurang apalagi jika dihubungkan dengan kebutuhan era society 5.0 yang menuntut profesionalisme guru yang handal dalam menyiapkan generasi unggul masa kini dan masa yang akan datang.

The era of society 5.0 is a continuation of the era of the industrial revolution 4.0 which further emphasizes the side of humanism in solving social problems including education by integrating virtual and reality. This study aims to analyze government policies on teacher development in the era of society 5.0 by using data sources or references in the form of books, journals, proceedings, and others which are generally called library research. There are several conditions and causes for the low quality of the teaching profession, including: 1) The standardization of minimum academic qualifications of D4/S1 teachers has not been achieved as stated in Permendiknas No. 16 of 2007, 2) Teacher competence is often hampered due to internal and external factors, 3) Ineffective teacher recruitment, 4) Teacher welfare in the form of income which is still very small and not comparable to the teacher's duty as a form of human character and civilization. Even though strategic policies from the government relating to these five things already exist, their implementation is still lacking, especially when connected with the needs of the 5.0 era society which demands reliable professionalism in preparing superior generations today and in the future. </jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Within the context of Industry 4.0 and of the new emerging Industry 5.0, human factors are becoming increasingly important, especially in Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC). This paper provides a novel study focused on the human aspects involved in industrial HRC by exploring the effects of various HRC setting factors. In particular, this paper aims at investigating the impact of industrial HRC on user experience, affective state, and stress, assessed through both subjective measures (i.e., questionnaires) and objective ones (i.e., physiological signals). A collaborative assembly task was implemented with different configurations, in which the robot movement speed, the distance between the operator and the robot workspace, and the control of the task execution time were varied. Forty-two participants were involved in the study and provided feedbacks on interaction quality and their affective state. Participants’ physiological responses (i.e., electrodermal activity and heart rate) were also collected non-invasively to monitor the amount of stress generated by the interaction. Analysis of both subjective and objective responses revealed how the configuration factors considered influence them. Robot movement speed and control of the task execution time resulted to be the most influential factors. The results also showed the need for customization of HRC to improve ergonomics, both psychological and physical, and the well-being of the operator.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Over the years, organizations have had to adapt to constant changes in their surroundings. To this end, they began to adopt methodologies such as lean manufacturing and Industry 4.0. Their implementation has increased the competitiveness of organizations. Sustainability is getting much attention, leading to the advent of Industry 5.0, which, unlike Industry 4.0, takes sustainable production into account. Forestry sectors are significant for the Portuguese economy, especially cork. This study examines a company in the cork sector to determine how automation and monetization of new resources could increase efficiency, quality, and safety. A qualitative approach was applied in the study through literature review and participant observation actions to analyze and propose improvements. The study fulfilled the purposes defined, identifying options to improve the production process and increase customer satisfaction and worker safety. </jats:p>

AB  - Human-centricity is the core value behind the evolution of manufacturing towards Industry 5.0. Nevertheless, there is a lack of architecture that considers safety, trustworthiness, and human-centricity at its core. Therefore, we propose an architecture that integrates Artificial Intelligence (Active Learning, Forecasting, Explainable Artificial Intelligence), simulated reality, decision-making, and users' feedback, focusing on synergies between humans and machines. Furthermore, we align the proposed architecture with the Big Data Value Association Reference Architecture Model. Finally, we validate it on two use cases from real-world case studies.

AB  - <jats:p>The manufacturing industry has undergone numerous revolutions over the years, with a unanimous acceptance of the greater benefits of being sustainable. The present industrial wave—Industry 4.0—by using its enabling technologies and principles holds great potential to develop sustainable manufacturing paradigms which require balancing out the three fundamental elements —products, processes, and systems. Yet, numerous stakeholders, including industrial policy and decision makers, remain oblivious of such potential and requirements. Thus, this bibliometric study is aimed at presenting an overview of the broad field of research on the convergence of sustainable manufacturing and Industry 4.0 under the umbrella of “Sustainable Manufacturing 4.0”, which has yet to be developed. It includes the dissemination of original findings on pathways and practices of Industry 4.0 applied to the development of sustainable manufacturing, contributing a bibliometric structure of the literature on the aforementioned convergence to reveal how Industry 4.0 could be used to shift the manufacturing sector to a more sustainable-based state. An initial research agenda for this emerging area has accordingly been presented, which may pave the way for having a futuristic view on Sustainable Manufacturing 5.0 in the next industrial wave, i.e., Industry 5.0.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>This time we start with several papers regarding the new wave of the Digital Era and the ICT Revolution, starting with the general Framework of Global and Remote Communication that represents on the context of an expanding Globalization the way we are opening to a new world with great opportunities, but that also brings some risks like the Moral Challenges of the advanced technologies of the 4th Industrial Revolution, that hopefully may be overcome in the 5th Industrial Revolution with the kind of Society 5.0 that is emerging in Japan. Moreover, advances in the Digital Era may also foster citizenship development as shown in the next paper; but at the same time represent a challenge regarding professional skills needed in particular for startups that are growing rapidly in number and size everywhere; so this is context of the next paper. Next paper is a study on the Quality of Life at work based on Leadership Models that in particular shows the positive impacts of a more Participatory Leadership. Next paper shows, through a survey of 396 companies in Brazil, that only a small number of organizations deal with the process of retaining professionals identified as potential successors that no doubt could be very relevant for the organization. Regarding Human Resources next paper is a study based on a Semantic Analysis about possibilities that are opening already, at the recruitment and selection process, by using Artificial Intelligence. Next paper seeks to find relationships between motivation and engagement and project management by means of a bibliometric analysis. For this purpose, was performed a cluster analysis of 529 articles using VOXviewer indicated that motivation in projects is strongly linked to professional development and growth, with increased interest in sustainability and in the relationship with stakeholders represented by the internal and external community of projects; and regarding Organizational Culture next paper shows, through a survey of 109 Organizations in Brazil, the importance of integrating Cultural Diversity in Organizations that may not only help to improve social conditions but also lead to recruiting better talents and leads to greater customer orientation, greater employee satisfaction and better decision making representing a win-win strategy. Still regarding Organizational Culture, and based on Quinn and Rohrbaugh’s model, next paper focus impacts on Competitive Strategy in the Banking Segment following Quinn and McGrath approach. Next paper is a statistical study regarding Fidelity in the Physical Fitness Business, using Logistic Regression and unidirectional ANOVA, that surprisingly show that frequency of use was the most relevant variable related to customer retention, rather than price and membership length. Today’s economic impacts of COVID-!9 is leading Public Policies in Governments like Brazil to drastically reduce Investments in Science and Technology that may end up decreasing the Human Development Index – HDI, as shown by next paper based on a previous study of the performance indicators in Science, Technology and Innovation CT&amp;I in 14 countries including some like Brazil. Today, 55% of the world's population lives in urban areas, a proportion that is expected to increase to 68% by 2050; as a matter of fact by 2050, two-thirds of all humanity will live in urban areas; and higher changes have actually been in Latin America and the Caribbean with 81.2% of the population already living in urban areas, up from 41.3% in 1950. Hence particularly in these regions sustainable development will become fundamental for the management of cities, so next paper dealing with a small city in southern Brazil may be helping as Best Practice Case. The city was able, through Team Works, to developed a Municipal Goals Plan based on the Sustainable Development Goals - SDG and in less than 4 years (2017-2020) 90% of which were reached through Work Teams driven basically by: The engagement of those responsible for2RISUS – Journal on Innovation and Sustainability, São Paulo, v. 12, n.2, p. 1-3, abr./mai. 2021 - ISSN 2179-3565Administrative Management, The importance of planning, at both strategic and operational levels, and the commitment of the teams in the execution of the actions. Actually, Brazil for some time has being already counting with an Open Sustainable Cities Program that help cities to develop its own strategies accordingly. Next paper is a survey of 48 companies in Brazil that using Crunchbase and Iramuteq technologies found three classes of business blockchain impact on Business models: A distributed value structure, a governance structure and an application structure aimed at encrypted and tokens. Next paper coming from Ukraine shows an approach for modelling a System of Balanced Criteria of Business Process Management (BPM), focused on large data volumes with a basic processes implemented using the cloud computing service — math.semestr, that may be promising in terms of automation of business process management. Last paper comes from Malaysia and deals with a trial on Home Buyers´ Willingness to Pay (WTP), using an on-line survey constructed using the LMA design tool provided in the ‘support.CEs’ package that showed that even a small and diversified sample of 20 respondents dealing with home buyer preferences for sustainable housing and analyzed using the package’s clogit function may give some results even for the measurement of a higher number of variables.</jats:p>

AB  - Big Data, the Internet of Things, and robotic and augmented realities are just some of the technologies that belong to Industry 4.0. These technologies improve working conditions and increase productivity and the quality of industry production. However, they can also improve life and society as a whole. A new perspective is oriented towards social well-being and it is called Society 5.0. Industry 4.0 supports the transition to the new society, but other drivers are also needed. To guide the transition, it is necessary to identify the enabling factors that integrate Industry 4.0. A conceptual framework was developed in which these factors were identified through a literature review and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) methodology. Furthermore, the way in which they relate was evaluated with the help of the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) methodology. The proposed framework fills a research gap, which has not yet consolidated a strategy that includes all aspects of Society 5.0. As a result, the main driver, in addition to technology, is international politics.

AB  - <jats:p>The industry is a key driver of economic development. However, changes caused by introduction of modern technologies, and increasing complexity of products and production, directly affect the industrial enterprises and workers. The critics of the Industry 4.0 paradigm emphasized its orientation to new technologies and digitalization in a technocratic way. Therefore, the new industrial paradigm Industry 5.0 appeared very soon and automatically triggered a debate about the role of, and reasons for applying, the new paradigm. Industry 5.0 is complementing the existing Industry 4.0 paradigm with the orientation to the worker who has an important role in the production process, and that role has been emphasized during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this research, there is a brief discussion on main drivers and enablers for introduction of these new paradigms, then a literature-based analysis is carried out to highlight the differences between two paradigms from three important aspects—people, organization, and technology. The conclusion emphasizes the main features and concerns regarding the movement towards Industry 5.0, and the general conclusion is that there is a significant change of the main research aims from sustainability towards human-centricity. At the end, the analysis of maturity models that evaluates enterprises’ readiness to introduce features of new paradigms is given as well.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>The innovation-driven Industry 5.0 leads us to consider humanity in a prominent position as the center of the manufacturing field even more than Industry 4.0. This pushes us towards the hybridization of manufacturing plants promoting a full collaboration between humans and robots. However, there are currently very few workplaces where effective Human–Robot Collaboration takes place. Layout designing plays a key role in assuring safe and efficient Human–Robot Collaboration. The layout design, especially in the context of collaborative robotics, is a complex problem to face, since it is related to safety, ergonomics, and productivity aspects. In the current work, a Knowledge-Based Approach (KBA) is adopted to face the complexity of the layout design problem. The framework resulting from the KBA allows for developing a modeling paradigm that enables us to define a streamlined approach for the layout design. The proposed approach allows for placing resource within the workplace according to a defined optimization criterion, and also ensures compliance with various standards. This approach is applied to an industrial case study in order to prove its feasibility. A what-if analysis is performed by applying the proposed approach. Changing three control factors (i.e., minimum distance, robot speed, logistic space configuration) on three levels, in a Design of Experiments, 27 layout configurations of the same workplace are generated. Consequently, the inputs that most affect the layout design are identified by means of an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The results show that only one layout is eligible to be the best configuration, and only two out of three control factors are very significant for the designing of the HRC workplace layout. Hence, the proposed approach enables the designing of standard compliant and optimized HRC workplace layouts. Therefore, several alternatives of the layout for the same workplace can be easily generated and investigated in a systematic manner.</jats:p>

AB  - An intelligent system is proposed to support decision-making to determine the presence of falsification in meat products based on histological studies. The tasks that must be solved for its development are formulated. The system architecture for the implementation of the formulated tasks is proposed. It includes, in particular, the expert subsystem and the decision support subsystem. Formalization of knowledge for making a decision about the presence of counterfeit is carried out on the basis of production rules. They are generated based on information contained in morphological tables. The development of a prototype ES is carried out in the programming language of artificial intelligence Prolog. The results of optimizing the approximation of a polychrome image of slices of meat products are described. A method for solving it based on a genetic algorithm is proposed. A program was developed in the C++ programming language, using which a complex of computational experiments was carried out to study the nature of the dependence of the convergence of the optimization process. Various parameters varied: the maximum number of iterations, the choice of the initial population. Further studies in this direction are related to the implementation of all the necessary image processing algorithms to automatically identify the required values of the characteristics of the image fragments for use in the cyber-physical system of automation of the process of identifying falsified meat products.

AB  - Moving towards Industry 5.0, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has become an indispensable role. IIoT devices could help manufacturing companies to observe various production statuses hence improving production efficiency. However, its limitation on resources and features makes robust security implementation a big challenge. Implementing a secure, general and scalable system to adopt across industries is one of the most critical topics for IIoT. This paper proposed a blockchain-based system architecture to auto-update, monitor, and fix the IIoT devices' software. We take the software status snapshots and store them as a blockchain ledger to protect the software's integrity and the software from unauthorized modification. To achieve auto-update and auto fix, we also simulate the concept of a blockchain contract to create the ledger whenever there are changes. As a result, the changes could continuously be tracked. The performance and scalability are also evaluated. The result shows that the system could also be deployed in larger-scale IIoT devices. The software update and fix could be guaranteed authenticated, and the unauthorized software could be monitored and detected.

AB  - <jats:p>methodology of evaluation of efficiency of the implementation at industrial enterprises of “peer-to-peer distributed systems of storage and processing of protected information in enterprise networks” has been proposed. The efficiency evaluation is based on the comparison of the indicators of reliability, fault tolerance, and total cost of ownership of the implementation of corporate information systems within the proposed system and its possible alternatives. The “peer-to-peer distributed system of storage and processing of protected information” is designed for the protection of distributed computing and incapsulation of private networks without restricting possibilities for usable interactions in the process of implementation of Industry 5.0 and Super Smart Society technologies. When these concepts get implemented in an enterprise, manufacture, logistics, and sales are merged into a global geographically and organizationally distributed information system for data exchange, which functions on top of the Internet. The proposed system offers tools for setting up distributed computing, and it ensures an effective response to threats by applying cryptography, unauthorized access protection with the use of biometry and an innovative protocol for information exchange and control of topology powered by distributed ledger technology, while also optimizing the utilization of computing capacity.</jats:p>

Yet its innovations are in danger of being subsumed into existing commercial practices, as society arguably continues to underestimate its ability, in conjunction with data collection, analysis, and communication tools, to disrupt current systems and enable a more equitable distribution of manufacturing wealth, capability, and capacity. This chapter highlights the potential of emerging industrial technologies to support a shift towards a more human-centered, responsible society where social and environmental problems are addressed through systems that maximises cyberspace and physical space integration, through the reframing of higher education engineering curriculum and pedagogy for manufacturing in Society 5.0. </jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p> Autonomous transportation is a new paradigm of an Industry 5.0 cyber-physical system that provides a lot of opportunities in smart logistics applications. The safety and reliability of deep learning-driven systems are still a question under research. The safety of an autonomous guided vehicle is dependent on the proper selection of sensors and the transmission of reflex data. Several academics worked on sensor-based difficulties by developing a sensor correction system and fine-tuning algorithms to regulate the system’s efficiency and precision. In this paper, the introduction of vision sensor and its scene terrain classification using a deep learning algorithm is performed with proposed datasets during sensor failure conditions. The proposed classification technique is to identify the mobile robot obstacle and obstacle-free path for smart logistic vehicle application. To analyze the information from the acquired image datasets, the proposed classification algorithm employs segmentation techniques. The analysis of proposed dataset is validated with U-shaped convolutional network (U-Net) architecture and region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) architecture model. Based on the results, the selection of 1400 raw image datasets is trained and validated using semantic segmentation classifier models. For various terrain dataset clusters, the Mask R-CNN classifier model method has the highest model accuracy of 93%, that is, 23% higher than the U-Net classifier model algorithm, which has the lowest model accuracy nearly 70%. As a result, the suggested Mask R-CNN technique has a significant potential of being used in autonomous vehicle applications. </jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Production systems are being expanded to include Digital Twins (DTs) as part of increased industrial digitalization. DTs can bring benefits e.g., increase visibility, safety, and accessibility of the system. Further, digital experimentation can reduce time and cost. Though, application of DT technologies involves challenges i.e., model accuracy or errors in transferring data or codes between the DT and the physical twin. Many studies on DTs focus on industrial applications. However, DT technology has potential for implementation of digital labs in education. This aspect of DTs is of rising importance as distance education has increased over the last decade and access to physical laboratories can be restricted due to factors such as the Covid-19 pandemic. Thus, there is a need to study the use of DT technology in higher education. To address this, we investigate possibilities and challenges of applying DT technology in education to conduct industrial-like labs virtually. A case of an automation line, with full scale industrial equipment, based at a research center, is focused. Results emphasize that the application of DT technologies require multi-domain expertise to understand the consequences of every single decision in the design process on every piece of equipment involved, making the modelling process complex and time consuming. Thus, when applied in education, test procedures need to be designed to focus on students’ motivation, improved learning and understanding of production systems. DTs are considered enabling technologies supporting the concept of Industry 5.0, thus stressing the human-centric aspects of advancing Industry 4.0. The predicted application of DTs emphasizes the need for educational curricula that include laboratory applications and theoretic understanding of DT technologies. This study focusses the application of DT technologies in higher education curricula, but the result of the study can contribute to other areas such as automation and virtual commissioning towards smarter manufacturing.</jats:p>

AB  - Policies are made on the basis of issues and considerations related to the expected goals. Technological developments will always affect human life so that they have an impact on how people think and behave in their lives.. The education sector, from time to time has developed into a polemic for individuals if a significant policy is not implemented. The data collection method from this article is carried out by using the literature study technique, in the form of reference sources from books,  journals and so on. Therefore, Indonesia is currently making this breakthrough by changing the curriculum policy to be "free to learn" which is intended so that the policy does not burden education both for educators and students. The policy of independent learning is intended to make the learning process more enjoyable and less boring. The independent learning curriculum is also expected to be able produce output from education who have high morals. That the independent learning curriculum strives for the role of technology, which is a human need today, to be integrated with another. So, in the era of society 5.0 problems of social life experienced by each individual will be combined with the role of technology which is used as a tool in solving problems of social life.

AB  - The Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR 4.0) had an impact on the form of art production and the art industry itself, eventually having huge implications for all of society and all aspects of life, including economy, education, and politics. The arts community needs to be aware and view the very broad framework of inter-art relationships and how IR 4.0 took place so that the production of the work is more relevant, up-to-date, and progressive. Several documents were reviewed to identify the dynamic framework of art within the IR 4.0. Art framework related to the IR 4.0 is detailed with components of the artist as co-creator, hybrid types of production, and attributes of a super smart society. Several key points should be referenced by humans so that they can be further prepared, better equipped, and more realistic for society 5.0.

AB  - <jats:p>The contemporary world becomes more and more volatile and unpredictable every year (dynamic development of technology—Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0, dynamic global changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic, great changes in consumer behavior, climate crisis, geopolitical disruptions). Individuals, companies, and supply chains face challenges emerging from economic, sociological, and political phenomena. These phenomena disrupt regular performance and limit the efficient functioning of companies and economies. Due to numerous relations and connections in the economy, disruptions in one area affect the others and spread, growing in range and severity. Hence, disruptions should be dealt with to provide continuity of supply chains and to ensure their efficient and effective performance. The study aims to identify crucial characteristics of disruptions to facilitate disruption minimization strategies. The characteristics of disruptions in supply chains are identified based on a literature review, synthesized and validated by the experts. A study is implemented to validate identified characteristics and to confront theoretical findings with the practical experience and observations of the experts. The results of the study are discussed and commented on. The conclusions from the study refer to the nature and characteristics of disruptions in the contemporary economy, equipping managers with useful knowledge when dealing with disruptions, and academics with observations that can stimulate further discussion on stability, flexibility, and resilience of companies and supply chains.</jats:p>

               <jats:p>The O&amp;G industry is facing big challenges which consequently raise the necessity for reforming its traditional business model and integrating digital disruptive technologies such as Digital Twins, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain. A Digital Twin(DT) is defined as a dynamic intelligent digital replica/model of the physical system/process/service/people which enables just-in-time informed decision making and root-cause analysis using AI. DTs are implanted at different levels such as Equipment/Asset Level Twin, System Level Twin, System of Systems (SoS) Level Twin.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>This research introduces a novel framework which is based on a Smart Secure Digital Twin (S2DT) to bridge the development gap compared to other leading industries such as manufacturing and automotive. The proposed model relies on Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) to implement edge intelligence and solve the problems of transfer latency and data overload and consequently achieves low carbon footprint. Edge Intelligence (EI) reduces energy consumption and enhances security and perspective maintenance. The Blockchain Technology is used to solve the privacy, and cybersecurity problems [4]. The Extended Reality (XR) will be used to ensure proper training of operators, and industry 5.0 to boost collaboration between human and machine. At the component level, security is maintained by integrated the locally generated intelligence on a blockchain to insure immutability, and enhance security.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>The Digital Transformation (DX) megatrend is fundamentally disrupting and changing the nature of work, business, and industry at a rapid pace. Although the notion of DX has garnered much research interest from practitioners, scholarship on this topic is somehow lagging behind, possibly because of the lack of theoretical frameworks on DX. Recently, most Japanese firms have begun to use diverse digital technologies to sustain their competitive advantages. However, the return of investment on digital technologies has not been as high as expected for some firms. Furthermore, as the visions of Industry 5.0 describe sustainable, resilient, and human-centered future factories that will require smart and resilient capabilities both from next-generation manufacturing systems and human operators, it is necessary to design resilient human–machine collaborations within factories. To this end, this paper presents a research model between DX technologies and scientific problem-solving in terms of deduction, induction, and abduction inference structures as an approach to resilient human–machine collaborations. The purpose of this research is to analyze the difference in the utilization pattern of the digital technology of American, German, and Japanese firms based on three types of decision-making methods. Next, we apply this framework in a comparative case study of two Japanese firms and one German firm, where we find that there is a difference in DX technologies utilization among the Japanese and German firms. We assert that the utilization of IoT technology in the United States and Germany is pursuing IoT with the aim of autonomous control, whereas Japanese firms prioritize robot–human collaboration. Finally, we discuss how our findings contribute to the burgeoning field of resilient human–machine collaborations by showing the distinct roles of deduction, induction, and abduction inference structures. Furthermore, our research contributes to international comparative studies to identify the difference in national IT utilization. Lessons and implications are discussed.</jats:p>

AB  - Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is the concrete practice of sustainable development at the enterprise level, emphasizing the human value in the production process. The proposal of Industry 5.0 begins to take the coordinated development between human and various production factors as one of the key points of corporate sustainable management. Therefore, this paper studies the optimization of medical enterprise’s operations management considering enterprise CSR under Industry 5.0. A mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is developed to maximize the CSR with the consideration of the impact of precision medical technologies such as surgical robots (SRs) and 3D bone printing on employee social welfare, corporate profits, social environment, and customer surplus value. An improved variable neighborhood tabu search (IVNTS) algorithm which combines the variable neighborhood tabu search (VNTS) algorithm and simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is designed to solve the model, and numerical experiments are analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed IVNTS. The research aids medical enterprise to make reasonable operations management decisions, while providing a reference for the government to draft and implement related policies, thereby achieving sustainable social development.

AB  - <jats:p>The dynamic development of the fourth industrial revolution, focused on the implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies, sparked fears of governments and society regarding the dehumanization of the industry in the future. Currently, there is a need to consider sustainable development and the crucial role of man in the assumptions of industry’s future development. Concerns about the implementation of the fourth industrial revolution’s technology became the basis for building the assumptions of Industry 5.0. The article aims to identify the social and economic expectations of the development of the fourth industrial revolution in the context of the development of the sustainability, humanization, and resilience of Industry 4.0. The article presents the results of research obtained based on a critical analysis of the literature and surveys conducted among representatives of Polish society. As a result of the research, key social expectations as to the directions of development of the Industry 4.0 concept were identified. Recommendations for industry development focused on three areas of development—human-centric, sustainable, and resilient—were established. The presented research results will allow the development of an investment strategy and a government policy to support the development of industry based on the human-centric digitization of the economy.</jats:p>

AB  - Every culture in the world passes down stories from generation to generation. These stories shape society and serve as moral guides. Unfortunately, with the rise of modern pop culture, the younger generations are no longer familiar with their cultural heritage. The latest developments in the creative industry show a rise in trends to adapt local culture into famous creative works with economic value. In light of the trend, the Visual Communication Design Department of Universitas Ciputra Surabaya and Da Yeh University Taiwan (Taiwan, ROC) created “Folktales of Indonesia and Taiwan”. This research will use the said book to determine whether illustrations are practical for cross-cultural storytelling. Qualitative data were collected from book users in both countries; the data was then compared with results from the literature study. The result shows that illustrations are effective as cross-cultural storytelling media as long as these are created based on extensive research of the source materials.

AB  - AbstractWith the fast-pacing adoption of concepts of Industry 4.0 and upcoming Industry 5.0 as far as the adoption of low-cost deployment is concerned, wireless network-based device-free sensing (DFS) is of great interest and has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of IoT in climate change detection. In extreme climates when the received signals are severely attenuated, the accuracy of classification of this technology is known to decrease remarkably; while neural nets have enhanced performance, they only function properly when trained with large numbers of evaluated based. Therefore, in extreme climates, where adequate samples are hard to procure, reasonable sensor exactness is still unspecified. We look at the possible application of anomaly detection methods based on machine learning. This study examines the performance of a top-down, phenomenology model generated using a neural net and large global average monthly temperature data. The neural network algorithm accurately forecasts an increase and drop in temperature throughout the next ten years by generating explicit depictions using the month-to-month temperature records of 30 years. In this paper, we constructed a deep classification system for the convolutional neural network and showed how beneficial deep learning is to address the problems of climate patterns.

AB  - AbstractThe Internet of things (IoT) has emerged into various application areas like agriculture, healthcare, defense, transportation, and manufacturing. The transformation of real things in the physical world to the Internet of things given a rise to industrial IoT (IIoT). IIoT applications are intended for the automation of the manufacturing industry, called Industry 4.0. Also, due to needs of end-user personalization, Industry 5.0 is becoming popular nowadays. Industry 5.0 is intended to inject artificial intelligence (AI) into human lives to improve capabilities and productivity. To make Industry 5.0 a successful revolution, IIoT must provide better efficiency, improved productivity, and better asset management. In this context, device-to-device communication plays an important role. IoT devices must be enabled with seamless communication technologies over heterogeneous networks. In this paper, communication standards, technologies, and various published research contributions are reviewed. Further, an analysis is presented to formulate challenges and opportunities for designing communication methods for IIoT. The paper also provides general directions for developing communication techniques in perspective to Industry 5.0.KeywordsIndustrial Internet of thingsCyber physical systemsDevice-to-device communicationIndustry 4.0Industry 5.0Fog computing

AB  - In the context of Industry 5.0, this paper studies the Cyber-Physical-Social Systems in UAVs based on the task background of transmission line project acceptance. Firstly, based on the idea of a parallel system, a parallel UAV planning system for transmission line project acceptance tasks is developed. The mathematical model based on swarm intelligence is then constructed from the multi-dimensional perspective of improving the acceptance efficiency, shortening the acceptance time, and reducing the energy consumption. This is done based on the physical system data, while considering the constraints of UAVs in performing acceptance tasks. Experiments are simulated based on the actual environment data of the quality supervision and acceptance of a 500kv transmission line project in a plateau area before it is put into production. The obtained results are compared with those of other similar cutting-edge algorithms. The efficiency and practicality of the proposed artificial parallel planning system are finally verified.
