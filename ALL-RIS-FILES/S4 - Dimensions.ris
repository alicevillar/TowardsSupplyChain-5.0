AB  - Are new technologies in the medicine sector a driver to support the development of a society 5.0? Innovation pushes the artisan to become smart and lean, customer-oriented but within a standardized environment of production, maintaining and ensuring the quality of the product. An artisan is a user and innovator, as an essential part of the industrial chain. In the healthcare sector, the doctor is the industrial artisan, and medicine can be considered as an example of a smart tool, strongly tailored, that embeds the innovation of materials, nano-devices, and smart technology (e.g., sensors and controllers). But how much of society is ready to host smart technology "on board", becoming "on life", constantly connected with remote controls that allow us to monitor, gather data, and, in any case, act, with preventive healthcare solutions? After a short overview of the medicine sector, a preliminary, tentative link between technological innovation and the healthcare sector allows us to adopt several outlooks on how to change research, always more transdisciplinary, combining science with social science in order to remain human-centered.

AB  - The world is heading in the wrong direction on carbon emissions where we are not on track to limit global warming to 1.5 °C; Ireland is among the countries where overall emissions have continued to rise. The development of wettable peatland products and services (termed 'Paludiculture') present significant opportunities for enabling a transition away from peat-harvesting (fossil fuels) to developing 'green' eco-innovations. However, this must be balanced with sustainable carbon sequestration and environmental protection. This complex transition from 'brown to green' must be met in real time by enabling digital technologies across the full value chain. This will potentially necessitate creation of new green-business models with the potential to support disruptive innovation. This timely paper describes digital transformation of paludiculture-based eco-innovation that will potentially lead to a paradigm shift towards using smart digital technologies to address efficiency of products and services along with future-proofing for climate change. Digital transform of paludiculture also aligns with the 'Industry 5.0 - a human-centric solution'. However, companies supporting peatland innovation may lack necessary standards, data-sharing or capabilities that can also affect viable business model propositions that can jeopardize economic, political and social sustainability. Digital solutions may reduce costs, increase productivity, improve produce develop, and achieve faster time to market for paludiculture. Digitisation also enables information systems to be open, interoperable, and user-friendly. This constitutes the first study to describe the digital transformation of paludiculture, both vertically and horizontally, in order to inform sustainability that includes process automation via AI, machine learning, IoT-Cloud informed sensors and robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and blockchain for cyber-physical systems. Thus, the aim of this paper is to describe the applicability of digital transformation to actualize the benefits and opportunities of paludiculture activities and enterprises in the Irish midlands with a global orientation.

AB  - In the era of Industry 4.0, manufacturing and production systems were revolutionized by increasing operational efficiency and developing and implementing new business models, services, and products. Concretely, the milestone set for Industry 4.0 was to improve the sustainability and efficiency of production systems. By extension, the emphasis was focused on both the digitization and the digitalization of systems, providing room for further improvement. However, the current technological evolution is more system/machine-oriented, rather than human-oriented. Thus, several countries have begun orchestrating initiatives towards the design and development of the human-centric aspect of technologies, systems, and services, which has been coined as Industry 5.0. The impact of Industry 5.0 will extend to societal transformation, which eventually leads to the generation of a new society, the Society 5.0. The developments will be focused on the social and human-centric aspect of the tools and technologies introduced under the framework of Industry 4.0. Therefore, sustainability and human well-being will be at the heart of what comes next, the Industry 5.0, as a subset of Society 5.0. Industry 5.0 will build on the foundations laid during Industry 4.0 by emphasizing human-centered, resilient, and sustainable design. Consequently, the authors in this research work, through a critical literature review, aim to provide adequate reasoning for considering Industry 5.0 as a framework for enabling the coexistence of industry and emerging societal trends and needs. The contribution of this research work extends to the provision of a framework to facilitate the transition from Industry 4.0 to Society 5.0.

AB  - In the past, manufacturing equipment was instrumented hard-wired. Industrial equipment such as sensors, controllers, and others are expensive, and upgrading manufacturing equipment in existing facilities is costly. The growing use of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven cost reductions in sensors, controllers, and communications through high volumes of digital devices and value-added components. The manufacturing sector with its massive installed base of legacy equipment has also become an area of interest for the advances in innovative digital technologies. Meanwhile, the next level of innovation in manufacturing has been achieved, labeled by the term 4th Industrial Revolution, in short Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 takes the automation of manufacturing processes to a new level by introducing customized and intelligent production technologies. Machines are connected and communicate with each other to ultimately make decisions, operate independently, or cooperate with humans in a customer-oriented production environment. This raises the question about the key issues of the next industrial enhancement and the term to call it? The change from Industry 4.0 to the next innovative industrial enhancement is termed Industry 5.0. However, Industry 5.0 has its root in the concept of Industry 4.0. Thus, the key issues of the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 can be seen in the goal of making manufacturability sustainable from economic, ecologic and societal perspectives. This requires building a circular economy with a focus on a human centric industry. The paper describes the development from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0.

With the increasing role of sustainability and concepts of Industry 5.0, focusing not just on improving production systems but also human wellbeing, quick decision making becomes essential. Data and digitalization are becoming the cornerstone for system improvement, and digital data availability and analysis can facilitate the utilization of computerized tools to support decision making and maximize the performance of complex systems. For that purpose, simulation can be a powerful analytical tool to design, maintain, and improve complex manufacturing systems. Simulation techniques usually allow handling the size and complexity commonly associated with manufacturing systems. However, in systems with highly customized and large-size products, manual processes, and limited floor space, the implementation of simulation techniques is not straightforward, especially considering the aspects of variability, data collection, model validation, and system reconfiguration. With a particular focus on large-size products and limitations of a constrained existing facility layout, this paper presents the implementation of a simulation-based reconfiguration assessment considering manual production, assembly, and internal logistics requirements. Going through an industrial case study of large recreational motorboats manufacturing, the paper analyses the system analysis, data collection, implementation, and validation of the methodology step by step. Considering different what-if scenarios, the focus is on the capacity reconfiguration using Discrete-Event Simulation. The results can serve as a guideline for decision-makers and stakeholders working with complex mass customization manufacturing systems and space-constrained facility layouts.

AB  - The term Industry 4.0, coined to be the fourth industrial revolution, refers to a higher level of automation for operational productivity and efficiency by connecting virtual and physical worlds in an industry. With Industry 4.0 being unable to address and meet increased drive of personalization, the term Industry 5.0 was coined for addressing personalized manufacturing and empowering humans in manufacturing processes. The onset of the term Industry 5.0 is observed to have various views of how it is defined and what constitutes the reconciliation between humans and machines. This serves as the motivation of this paper in identifying and analyzing the various themes and research trends of what Industry 5.0 is using text mining tools and techniques. Toward this, the abstracts of 196 published papers based on the keyword “Industry 5.0” search in IEEE, science direct and MDPI data bases were extracted. Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed for further analysis to apply text mining techniques of key terms extraction and frequency analysis. Further topic mining i.e., unsupervised machine learning method was used for exploring the data. It is observed that the terms artificial intelligence (AI), big data, supply chain, digital transformation, machine learning, internet of things (IoT), are among the most often used and among several enablers that have been identified by researchers to drive Industry 5.0. Five major themes of Industry 5.0 addressing, supply chain evaluation and optimization, enterprise innovation and digitization, smart and sustainable manufacturing, transformation driven by IoT, AI, and Big Data, and Human-machine connectivity were classified among the published literature, highlighting the research themes that can be further explored. It is observed that the theme of Industry 5.0 as a gateway towards human machine connectivity and co-existence is gaining more interest among the research community in the recent years.

AB  - Emergence of industry 5.0 facilitates real-time synchronisation of production processes, which helps with the production of customized products. Although industry 5.0 can revolutionize the landscape of goods production, still its adoption is in the infancy stage. Hence, the purpose of this article is to examine barriers that impede the adoption of industry 5.0, and to propose solution initiatives (SIs). After an in-depth literature review and interviews with German industry experts in pharmaceutical sector, barriers and SIs are ranked using an integrated Analytical hierarchy process-elimination and choice expressing reality-decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (AHP-ELECTRE-DEMATEL) approach. “Linking virtual reality and reality” is found to be the most critical deterrent to the adoption of industry 5.0, and falls into a causal group, which signifies their influence on other deterrents. “Measures for better connectivity with patients” is of utmost importance for German firms to ensure secure communication and safeguard patient data. The findings also highlight the problems with the adoption of high-tech innovations due to lack of standardization and fair benchmarking policies on industry 5.0. This article concludes by proposing an industry 5.0 framework. The inhibitors to adopting industry 5.0 were investigated in this article, the results of which will assist practitioners and decision makers to understand the issues with industry 5.0. The results of this article will help potential adopters of this technology to look for the SIs. This will therefore pave the path for effective adoption of industry 5.0 across the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector.

AB  - The intelligent manufacturing is a complex engineering system, and the cyber–physical systems (CPSs) and the industrial Internet are the preliminary infrastructures. When cyber–physical–social systems (CPSSs) are formed by extending CPS into the social aspect, Societies 5.0 era is coming. In the Societies 5.0 era, social manufacturing (SM) is an innovative manufacturing solution for intelligent manufacturing. In this article, a survey on SM is introduced. It includes the definition and theory of SM, and comparison between SM and other manufacturing paradigms. Moreover, the key supporting technologies are presented, which can be used to realize SM, such as blockchain, 3-D printing, and big data. Then, the applications of SM to industries are illustrated. The SM has broad application prospects in the high-end customized, distributed manufacturing, and other intelligent manufacturing. Finally, the challenges and future trends are discussed.

AB  - This work aims to study the evolution of Supply Chain (SC) towards Society 5.0 paradigm proposing a set of SCs to enhance the active role of involved stakeholders leveraging on digital technologies. Social macro-trends indeed strongly impact on companies’ business creating the urgent need to significantly adapt the way their SCs are organized and interlinked. The work is based on a consultation with experts representing different kind of companies, industrial sectors, function, role in the SC and research fields. Results lead to the identification of possible SCs for the future, and among them, three solutions seems to particularly fit current challenges related to the evolution of society: Human-centric SC, SC for active citizens and SC in urban context. According to the identified SCs, specific issues are presented and possible solutions basing on new technologies have been mapped with the support of experts. The need to integrate strategies at industrial and societal level urge thus for a new holistic way where business eco-system capabilities merge with civil society needs for have people wellbeing as a major priority.

AB  - Manufacturing engineering is now moving into the digital era, otherwise known as Industry 4.0. The next paradigm shift that is fast approaching and this is the era of personalisation and customisation, known as Industry 5.0. To facilitate this personalisation of products, human and technology must work together seamlessly in a manner where the best of both is leveraged. Human centred systems are at the heart of this revolution. One of the most important enablers of this change is the education of our technologists, our university degrees and post graduate programmes must embed this expertise into their core modules. This contribution looks the educational aspects of the MSc in Engineering Management in the Technical University of Vienna Austria (TUWien) as an example of education which has evolved to facilitate emerging trends. An introduction and a short history of this executive postgraduate MSc is presented, as it is a long established and well know programme which dates back to 1995.

AB  - Benefiting from the marriage of just-in-time (JIT) and computer integrated manufacturing (CIM), a series of manufacturing planning and control (MPC) systems has been introduced for contemporary production and operations management. However, the increasing requirements for customized and personalized products and services, together with the acceleration of the socio-economic environment in the age of Industry 4.0, forced manufacturers to re-evaluate their current MPC strategies that mainly emphasize time, cost and quality priorities. Industry 4.0 presents a solid ambition for transforming to a digital, data-driven and interconnected manufacturing industry centred around cyber-physical convergence. Although the relevance of Industry 4.0 technologies’ disruptions on operations management has been acknowledged, a significant gap in the evolution of the logic and design of MPC systems has been observed. The requirements of on-demand products and services with enhanced flexibility, resilience, sustainability and humanitarianism in this new industrial revolution call for innovations of MPC architectures and approaches. This paper first summarizes the evolution of MPC systems with enabling technologies and the changing business climate at that time. To explore innovative MPC that complies with the increasing economic, social and environmental requirements, the concept of synchronization-oriented MPC with four principles is proposed. Following the principles, a general framework for the synchronization-oriented MPC with enhanced economic, social and environmental benefits is developed. This work potentially provides insights into innovative MPC in the age of Industry 4.0 and even Industry 5.0.

AB  - An impact of a modern industrial system, such as in Industry 5.0, which brings customer authorization deeper into the manufacturing stream, may give pressure toward the industrial working system. Along with this system transformation, the declining trend of labor number as world demographical change created demand for higher productivity worker, which is stronger and more versatile for handling more than one working station, giving added value and personalization in fulfilling customer needs. Assistive Technology (AT) which is formerly for disabled or handicapped people, would be more widely used for everyone and working for its new purposes in producing higher individual physical capacity. A common challenge of providing a wearable AT, such as limb prostheses, orthoses, or exoskeletons, is customizing their geometry to fit on user body parts. In Industrial context, this would even be more challenging since it must be provided in massive number which can overburden companies overhead. The disruptive technology of prototyping such as 3D scanning and 3D printing brings a customized prototype into a new level of accomplishment life cycle and affordability. New processing technology and material development in 3D printing eventually transform rapid prototyping into rapid manufacturing of final AT product. This paper aims to examine recent research and development of AT from AT developers and communities as well as its novel development process. The new challenges of new AT existence are discussed further in the context of working safety and product standardization and a study about its impacts towards industrial productivity are highlighted.

AB  - In March 2020 the world as we know it was shaken to the core by the Covid-19 global pandemic. This crisis has had a significant impact on the EU27 economy and triggered unprecedented policy responses across Europe and the globe. Collaborative Robotics, or Cobots, have made a significant difference to many manufacturing plants by facilitating social distancing between workers, introducing flexibility on the factory floor and allowing the plants to manufacture high quality items for use in the medical field. California-based DCL Logistics, a third-party logistics company, decided to employ Cobots to manage a 30% increase in orders in the immediate aftermath of the outbreak and the Cobots have led to a 300% increase in productivity and a 60% jump in labor cost savings [1]. This paper will look at these flexible robots and discuss the benefits they brought to manufacturing in a time of global crisis.

AB  - In the next years, it will be increasingly important to re-think manufacturing and logistics systems from a human-centred perspective to promote a balanced use of automation and digital technologies to enhance the unique and irreplaceable capabilities of operators, who will continue to play a fundamental role in the factories of the future. The sixteen papers published in this special issue aim at contributing to the main emerging research streams about human-technology integration in the next-generation manufacturing and logistics systems. In particular, four main macro-topics have emerged: human-machine integration, human-robot collaboration, worker assistance systems and work design 4.0. In the papers, novel conceptual frameworks and architectures are presented and laboratory tests are carried out, promoting relevant advances in the field of human-technology integration. Nevertheless, the analysis of the papers in the special issue reveals that it is still necessary to investigate and explore human-technology integration, especially by developing interfaces that increasingly support the operators. At the same time, it is necessary to rethink the traditional workforce, taking more account of human factors, which intervene in the tasks of operators and managers in order to increase technology acceptability and usage. As a result, there is a growing need to move towards Industry 5.0, with human-centred and socially sustainable design and development of new manufacturing and logistics solutions.

AB  - It has been speculated that by the year 2050, technology will have progressed to the point of complete autonomy. This paper scrolls through patent pathways and intellectual developments throughout the industrial revolutions listing significant products and services that landmarked each revolution up to Industry 4.0. The patent trails and the recent IPR inputs are expected to assist readers in fast‐tracking up to speed on the bleeding edge of the current research pools while having an eagle's eye perspective on the previous developments so far. The research pools of Industry 4.0 are classified and explored. A lack of Human‐machine workforce synergy in Industry 4.0 and the nascent “customized manufacturing” concept is addressed in subsequent sections. The paper classifies two expected phases of Industry 5.0, highlighting the subdomains touted to be its focal areas. Lastly, Industry 5.0's niche research areas are checked and a suitable pathway to achieve the goals set for the sixth revolution is proposed.

AB  - Industry 4.0 has brought about a revolution in how the manufacturing industry operates, from the product concept generation to the automated, high-tech factories that fabricate the products. Manufacturing systems are fully integrated, multi-robot and collaborative. The key elements of Industry 4.0 are information and communications technology (ICT), connectedness, sensor technology, robotics and innovative production systems. Smart manufacturing systems producing smart products. The result of this highly automated environment of Industry 4.0 is that the humans are at risk of no longer playing a valuable role. This paper asks the following questions: Can we ensure that humans have a place in the highly automated workplace of the future (Industry 5.0) by optimizing human capital? Can the traditional educational provider supply the skills required to educate this modern worker or do we require an innovative educational system?

AB  - Industry 4.0 have witnessed a paradigm shift from cyber-physical systems (CPS) that aims at massive automation, to a more customer-driven approach. The shift has been attributed to the design of hyper-cognitive systems, integration of virtual and extended reality, digital machinery prototyping and twin designs, trusted machine boundaries, collaborative robots, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based supply chains. This new wave, termed Industry 5.0, is expected to leverage massive production with user-centric customization outside the scope of Industry 4.0 ecosystems. Industry 5.0 is expected to assist diverse industrial verticals like healthcare, smart farming, drones, smart grids, and supply chain production ecosystems. However, data is shared among multiple heterogeneous networks, spanning different authoritative domains. Thus, trusted and secured data transfer is crucial to synergize and secure the industrial perimeters. Blockchain (BC) is a preferred choice as a security enabler to Industry 5.0 ecosystems owing to its inherent property of immutability, chronology, and auditability in industrial systems. Limited works are proposed that present the vision and holistic view of BC-assisted Industry 5.0 applications. The article presents a first-of-its-kind survey on BC as a security enabler in Industry 5.0. Based on a descriptive survey methodology and research questions, we presented the key drivers, and potential applications, and propose an architectural vision of BC-based Industry 5.0 in diverse applicative verticals. The survey intends to present solutions that would assist industry practitioners, academicians, and researchers to drive novel BC-assisted solutions in Industry 5.0 verticals.

AB  - Industry 5.0 constitutes a change of paradigm where the increase of economic benefits caused by a never-ending increment of production is no longer the only priority. Instead, Industry 5.0 addresses social and planetary challenges caused or neglected in Industry 4.0 and below. One relevant the most relevant challenges of Industry 5.0 is the design of human-centered smart environments (i.e., that prioritize human well-being while maintaining production performance). In these environments, robots and humans will share the same space and collaborate to reach common objectives. This article presents a literature review of the different aspects concerning the problem of quality measurement in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) applications for manufacturing environments. To help practitioners and new researchers in the area, this article presents an overview of factors, metrics, and measures used in the robotics community to evaluate performance and human well-being quality aspects in HRI applications. For this, we performed a systematic search in relevant databases for robotics (Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, ACM digital library, and Springer Link). We summarize and classify results extracted from 102 peer-reviewed research articles published until March 2022 in two definition models: 1) a taxonomy of performance aspects and 2) a Venn Diagram of common human factors in HRI. Additionally, we briefly explain the differences between often confusing or overlapped concepts in the area. We also introduce common human factors evaluated by the robotics community and identify seven emergent research topics which can have a relevant impact on Industry 5.0.

AB  - Due to recent technology progress in areas such as IoT, AI, big data and robotics, Japanese industry is heading towards the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The industrial system is shifting from manufacturing worksite superiority to intelligence or software superiority in manufacturing. The government promotes these trends through its Society 5.0 initiative. Software superiority in manufacturing facilitates front loading; the conversion of skills to explicit knowledge makes progress in manufacturing processes through the use of IT and craftsmanship. This research deals with three cases. The first case is a company-developed system that’s scalable from customized products to standard products and that realizes diversified products via microscale production. The second case, focusing on the introduction of robots and a robot system integrator (SIer), is the keystone company within the SIer community; its business consists of robot engineering projects and FA educational system projects. The third case, metal 3D printing manufacturing, is invigorating. The company is the first service bureau in Japan that is capable of providing comprehensive services in the field of metal additive manufacturing (AM), handling everything from powder development and manufacture to prototyping and mass production needs. Clearly, IoT and the servitization of industry are the two wheels of a cart in industry, significantly transforming not only manufacturing sites but also business models. Although each case represents a different field of industry, each meets a unique and remarkable challenge in standardization, platform and ecosystem. In the digital age, IoT is an enabler and provides a background for transformation of business models. Through servitization, businesses can be the field for co-creation by feeding back the experience of learning-by-doing and reorganizing it. It is a powerful option for company to meet the challenge of service platform building.

AB  - The recent shift to wellbeing, sustainability, and resilience under Industry 5.0 has prompted formal discussions that manufacturing should be human-centric – placing the wellbeing of industry workers at the center of manufacturing processes, instead of system-centric – only driven by efficiency and quality improvement and cost reduction. However, there is a lack of shared understanding of the essence of human-centric manufacturing, though significant research efforts exist in enhancing the physical and cognitive wellbeing of operators. Therefore, this position paper presents our arguments on the concept, needs, reference model, enabling technologies and system frameworks of human-centric manufacturing, providing a relatable vision and research agenda for future work in human-centric manufacturing systems. We believe human-centric manufacturing should ultimately address human needs defined in an Industrial Human Needs Pyramid – from basic needs of safety and health to the highest level of esteem and self-actualization. In parallel, human-machine relationships will change following a 5C evolution map – from current Coexistence, Cooperation and Collaboration to future Compassion and Coevolution. As such, human-centric manufacturing systems need to have bi-directional empathy, proactive communication and collaborative intelligence for establishing trustworthy human-machine coevolution relationships, thereby leading to high-performance human-machine teams. It is suggested that future research focus should be on developing transparent, trustworthy and quantifiable technologies that provide a rewarding working environment driven by real-world needs.

AB  - The last 20 years have brought significant developments to digital fabrication technology, known as additive manufacturing (3D printing), and it has finally started to shed its prototyping mantel in favor of an industrial one. Yet its innovations are in danger of being subsumed into existing commercial practices, as society arguably continues to underestimate its ability, in conjunction with data collection, analysis, and communication tools, to disrupt current systems and enable a more equitable distribution of manufacturing wealth, capability, and capacity. This chapter highlights the potential of emerging industrial technologies to support a shift towards a more human-centered, responsible society where social and environmental problems are addressed through systems that maximises cyberspace and physical space integration, through the reframing of higher education engineering curriculum and pedagogy for manufacturing in Society 5.0.

AB  - Industry 5.0 follows the steps of the Industry 4.0 paradigm and seeks for revolutionizing the way industries operate. In fact, Industry 5.0 focuses on research and innovation to support industrial production sustainability and place the well-being of industrial workers at the center of the production process. Thus, Industry 5.0 relies on three pillars: it is human-centric, it encourages sustainability and it is aimed at developing resilience against disruptions. Such core aspects cannot be fully achieved without a transparent end-to-end human-centered traceability throughout the value chain. As a consequence, Auto-Identification (Auto-ID) technologies play a key role, since they are able to provide automated item recognition, positioning and tracking without human intervention or in cooperation with industrial operators. Although the most popular Auto-ID technologies provide a certain degree of security and productivity, there are still open challenges for future Industry 5.0 factories. This article analyzes and evaluates the Auto-ID landscape and delivers a holistic perspective and understanding of the most popular and the latest technologies, looking for solutions that cope with harsh, diverse and complex industrial scenarios. In addition, it describes a methodology for selecting Auto-ID technologies for Industry 5.0 factories. Such a methodology is applied to a specific use case of the shipbuilding industry that requires identifying the main components of a ship during its construction and repair. To validate the outcomes of the methodology, a practical evaluation of passive and active UHF RFID tags was performed in an Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV) under construction, showing that a careful selection and evaluation of the tags enables product identification and tracking even in areas with a very high density of metallic objects. As a result, this article serves as a useful guide for industrial stakeholders, including future developers and managers that seek for deploying identification and traceability technologies in Industry 5.0 scenarios.

AB  - In the context of the Industry 4.0 approach, applications and solutions supporting monitoring, simulation, optimisation and decision-making in production systems are exponentially growing. These solutions are commonly built on digital twins, i.e., comprehensive, structured and effective digital representations of the production system and its entities, whose current status is constantly updated by the plugged data sources. The arising of the Industry 5.0 paradigm and the established key role of workers in manufacturing require new Digital Twins to represent also humans. In fact, as cognitive automation becomes more and more pervasive and its behaviour unintelligible to humans, it becomes essential for improving performance and well-being, at the same time, to model humans as data-driven agents and to represent their interaction with the factory systems. Currently, a standardised solution for creating Digital Twins is missing, forcing industrial solution architects to resort to ad-hoc implementations and models. These solutions lack re-usability, scalability and extensibility, preventing the introduction of a human digital representation in existent twins, so hindering the complete shift to the new Industry 5.0 paradigm. In this paper, such limitations are faced by introducing an extensible and flexible IIoT-industrial internet of things-based platform with a twofold benefit: on the one hand, to support the creation of customised data representations of production systems and their entities including humans; on the other hand, to provide a modular infrastructure, along with its interchangeable components, for easy digital twin instantiation and ramp-up. An implementation of the platform has been tested with different applications in a laboratory setting and released as a public resource. Finally, potential future applications of the proposed digital twin are discussed, highlighting its main benefits.

One of these concepts is Industry 5.0, which, according to the European Commission, focuses on sustainable manufacturing and operator well-being and complements Industry 4.0 as it seeks to improve factory efficiency through technology by placing the human being at the center of development. At the same time, it minimizes environmental and social impacts and enhances resilience. Aware that implementing these new trends is a challenge for MSMEs, this study contributes to the generation of indicators to evaluate elements of Industry 5.0 in the textile production of MSMEs, supporting the development and implementation of strategies focused on this area. The construction of the set of indicators is based on a 3-phase framework that consists of doing a systematic literature review, selecting the indicators by a process of analysis and comparison, and expanding their characteristics through elaborating data sheets. As part of the results, 172 indicators completed a rigorous selection and validation process. These will serve as the basis for developing sustainable, resilient, and human-centered production models that can be carried out in future research.

AB  - The increasing skill mismatch in manufacturing workforce is raising demand for training opportunities to cope with advanced manufacturing systems. To maintain production and adjust quickly to technological transformation, innovative work-based learning approaches are emphasized. Intelligent machines are becoming capable of interaction and collaboration with humans. They not only introduce a new type of learnable workforce to manufacturing but may open opportunities to enhance learning of all learners. Symbiotic relationships of humans and machines have wide potential for human-centric manufacturing (aka Industry 5.0). Moreover, connecting smart devices and deploying self-learning solutions is envisioned to increase flexibility of manufacturing, thus changing work division between humans and machines. Where humans and machines collaborate, the term Reciprocal Learning has been coined to describe the process of bidirectional learning. While a definition of Reciprocal Learning exists the boundary conditions of the concept are still ambiguous. In this paper, a framework for Reciprocal Learning in Human-Machine Collaboration for Industry 5.0 is presented to clarify what it is and what it isn’t. The approach is based on a multi-agent system perspective, comprising human and machine agents. Finally, an outlook on future research is presented.

AB  - Deep natural language processing is an algorithmic approach that enables computers to understand language using patterns, purpose, adequate experience, and a natural human data extraction context. It goes beyond a strategy for syntax and depends on a semantic strategy. Industry 5.0 democratizes the co-production of information from Big Data, building on the current symmetrical innovation concept. The Industrial Revolution 5.0 is transforming companies into working through human and computer cooperation with the massive amount of data. Industry 5.0 develops human expertise and accuracy of the computer and will be creative and satisfy consumer needs with the final product. Big data produces usable data and analyzes the best data suited for the good of the industry. The industry has no benefit from NLP converted knowledge without Big Data. Currently, users can get information from several Web sites and do not have enough time to scan all Web sites. Data is distributed with various forms of data such as education, cinema, and politics. Numerous Web sites and social media (WhatsApp, Twitter, etc.) data are distributed in the world. These different data are collected via social media and stored in one SoloDB database that allows the user to access it quickly and easily. With the authorization of the administrative process, the database information can be accessed. Deep natural language, Big Data, and artificial intelligence will be discussed, and the results will be evaluated using the Industry 5.0 private database. The combination of computer and person would make it easy to access information from the database in a customized manner.

AB  - In modern digital era, technology has dominated in all sectors of society. In manufacturing sectors, technology development has been divided into different time zones (Industry 1.0–4.0). These industrial upheavals have highly focused on technology applications. But modern challenges of customization, personalization and technology upgrading can only be done by human involvement. These modern challenges have led to new industrial revolution called “Industry 5.0,” which emphasizes on technology advancement with human empowerment. In this research paper, authors have studied the enablers, which help in execution of Industry 5.0 in Indian manufacturing sector. Eight enablers have been distinguished by literature review and specialist’s supposition. By using total interpretative structural modeling (TISM) technique, authors have studied the relationship between these enablers. Authors have developed a diagraph to show structural relationship between different enablers influencing implementation of Industry 5.0 in Indian manufacturing sector.

AB  - Staying at the top is getting tougher and more challenging due to the fast-growing and changing digital technologies and AI-based solutions. The world of technology, mass customization, and advanced manufacturing is experiencing a rapid transformation. Robots are becoming even more important as they can now be coupled with the human mind by means of brain–machine interface and advances in artificial intelligence. A strong necessity to increase productivity while not removing human workers from the manufacturing industry is imposing punishing challenges on the global economy. To counter these challenges, this article introduces the concept of Industry 5.0, where robots are intertwined with the human brain and work as collaborator instead of competitor. This article also outlines a number of key features and concerns that every manufacturer may have about Industry 5.0. In addition, it presents several developments achieved by researchers for use in Industry 5.0 applications and environments. Finally, the impact of Industry 5.0 on the manufacturing industry and overall economy is discussed from an economic and productivity point of view, where it is argued that Industry 5.0 will create more jobs than it will take away.

AB  - Zero defect manufacturing (ZDM) aims at eliminating defects throughout the value stream as well as the cost of rework and scrap. The ambitious goal of zero defects requires the extensive utilization of emerging technologies. Amidst the major drive for technological advancement, humans are often kept out of the loop because they are perceived as the root cause of error. The report from the European Commission on Industry 5.0 emphasizes that human-centric is a key pillar in building a more resilient industry and is vital to incorporate the human component into the manufacturing sector. However, we did not find any publications that explain what human-centric ZDM is, nor what the roles of humans are in advancing ZDM. As a contribution to bridging this gap, a systematic literature review is conducted using different databases. We collected 36 publications and categorised them into 3 different human roles which are managers, engineers, and operators. From our search, we found out that managers play a vital role in cultivating ZDM in the entire organization to prevent errors despite the fact they often do not have direct contact with the production line as operators. Operators can help advance ZDM through knowledge capturing with feedback functions to the engineer to better design a corrective action to prevent errors. Assistive technologies such as extended reality are efficient tools used by operators to eliminate human errors in production environments. Human-centric is now a goal in the future manufacturing sector, but it could face barriers such as high technological investments and resistance to changes in their work tasks. This paper can contribute to paving the roadmap of human-centric ZDM to bring defects to zero and reposition the manufacturing sector to become more resilient.

AB  - In recent years, the introduction of collaborative robotic solutions is constantly revolutionizing and innovating production processes by identifying new types of physical, cognitive, sensory, social and emotional interaction between user-operator and robot aimed at enhancing human capital. Starting from the preliminary study already realized on the different user-robot collaboration categorizations present in the literature (Formati et al, 2021), the new contribution, through the review of the still insufficient regulatory framework, ergonomic factors and robotic systems existing in the manufacturing field, returns the definition of further specifications about the collaboration modalities. In the current technological ecosystem, through the discipline of design is possible to prefigure and reinforce the collaborative processes through the introduction of new protocols and tools to support the regulatory standards, synthesis and evolution of the investigated categorizations, in order to optimize the production system as a whole and improve the working conditions of the operator with the robotic systems in terms of predictability, reliability, and usability.

AB  - Human-centricity is the core value behind the evolution of manufacturing
towards Industry 5.0. Nevertheless, there is a lack of architecture that
considers safety, trustworthiness, and human-centricity at its core. Therefore,
we propose an architecture that integrates Artificial Intelligence (Active
Learning, Forecasting, Explainable Artificial Intelligence), simulated reality,
decision-making, and users' feedback, focusing on synergies between humans and
machines. Furthermore, we align the proposed architecture with the Big Data
Value Association Reference Architecture Model. Finally, we validate it on
three use cases from real-world case studies.

AB  - The Internet of things (IoT) has emerged into various application areas like agriculture, healthcare, defense, transportation, and manufacturing. The transformation of real things in the physical world to the Internet of things given a rise to industrial IoT (IIoT). IIoT applications are intended for the automation of the manufacturing industry, called Industry 4.0. Also, due to needs of end-user personalization, Industry 5.0 is becoming popular nowadays. Industry 5.0 is intended to inject artificial intelligence (AI) into human lives to improve capabilities and productivity. To make Industry 5.0 a successful revolution, IIoT must provide better efficiency, improved productivity, and better asset management. In this context, device-to-device communication plays an important role. IoT devices must be enabled with seamless communication technologies over heterogeneous networks. In this paper, communication standards, technologies, and various published research contributions are reviewed. Further, an analysis is presented to formulate challenges and opportunities for designing communication methods for IIoT. The paper also provides general directions for developing communication techniques in perspective to Industry 5.0.

AB  - Smart machine companions such as artificial intelligence (AI) assistants and collaborative robots are rapidly populating the factory floor. Future factory floor workers will work in teams that include both human co-workers and smart machine actors. The visions of Industry 5.0 describe sustainable, resilient, and human-centered future factories that will require smart and resilient capabilities both from next-generation manufacturing systems and human operators. What kinds of approaches can help design these kinds of resilient human–machine teams and collaborations within them? In this paper, we analyze this design challenge, and we propose basing the design on the joint cognitive systems approach. The established joint cognitive systems approach can be complemented with approaches that support human centricity in the early phases of design, as well as in the development of continuously co-evolving human–machine teams. We propose approaches to observing and analyzing the collaboration in human–machine teams, developing the concept of operations with relevant stakeholders, and including ethical aspects in the design and development. We base our work on the joint cognitive systems approach and propose complementary approaches and methods, namely: actor–network theory, the concept of operations and ethically aware design. We identify their possibilities and challenges in designing and developing smooth human–machine teams for Industry 5.0 manufacturing systems.

AB  - One of the visions of Industry 5.0 is a human-centered design and value creation. In the quality field, the lean six sigma (LSS) method has been proven to develop better production activities successfully. Embedding LSS into a human-oriented discipline can create a perfect combination of more human processes and a better result environment. The lean concept adopts a people-oriented approach, cares about employees and customers, and emphasizes sustainable development. At the same time, the Six Sigma philosophy and Industry 5.0 emphasize innovation to reduce process variation and achieve iterative process improvement. We propose a new sustainable innovation framework (SIF) through inductive and integrative approaches based on LSS tools and Industry 5.0 technologies to achieve process excellence. Six LSS 5.0 tools and its implementation guidelines are developed. These six tools are designed to support the concept of actual SIF becoming more implementable. A case study has been conducted to illustrate how LSS 5.0 tools can be applied and their expected results. This study can make a significant contribution through the proposed framework, and a practical concept becomes easier to implement in work organizations.

AB  - Although manufacturing companies are currently situated at a transition point in what has been called Industry 4.0, a new revolutionary wave—Industry 5.0—is emerging as an ‘Age of Augmentation’ when the human and machine reconcile and work in perfect symbiosis with one another. Recent years have indeed assisted in drawing attention to the human-centric design of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) and to the genesis of the ‘Operator 4.0’, two novel concepts that raise significant ethical questions regarding the impact of technology on workers and society at large. This paper argues that a value-oriented and ethical technology engineering in Industry 5.0 is an urgent and sensitive topic as demonstrated by a survey administered to industry leaders from different companies. The Value Sensitive Design (VSD) approach is proposed as a principled framework to illustrate how technologies enabling human–machine symbiosis in the Factory of the Future can be designed to embody elicited human values and to illustrate actionable steps that engineers and designers can take in their design projects. Use cases based on real solutions and prototypes discuss how a design-for-values approach aids in the investigation and mitigation of ethical issues emerging from the implementation of technological solutions and, hence, support the migration to a symbiotic Factory of the Future.

AB  - Industry 5.0 is based on the idea of merging sustainable development goals and digitalization provisions from the fourth industrial revolution through human-centric solutions, bio-inspired technologies, and cyber safe data transmission. Industries are yet the most significant drivers of the integrated sustainability development (economic, environmental, and social) over the design, manufacturing, operation and disposal of products and services. This research investigates Industry 5.0 indicators that are required to achieve sustainable reliability centered maintenance (RCM) for high-value equipment. The research work examines the feasibility of a correlation between sustainable indicators between operation and maintenance phases using fuzzylogic. The fuzzy approach is implemented to measure the impact of RCM technical indicators on sustainability. A broader recommendation to improve sustainable RCM is presented through an academic survey.

AB  - Industry 5.0 complements the Industry 4.0 paradigm by highlighting research and innovation as drivers for a transition to a sustainable, human-centric and resilient industry. In this context, new types of interactions between operators and machines are facilitated, that can be realized through artificial intelligence (AI) based and voice-enabled Digital Intelligent Assistants (DIA). Apart from the existing technological challenges, this direction requires new methodologies for the evaluation of such technological solutions that will be able to treat AI in manufacturing as a socio-technical system. In this paper, we propose a framework for the evaluation of voice-enabled AI solutions in Industry 5.0, which consists of four dimensions: the trustworthiness of the AI system; the usability of the DIA; the cognitive workload of individual users; and the overall business benefits for the corporation.

AB  - In light of the Industry 5.0 trend towards human-centric and resilient industries, human-robot collaboration (HRC) assembly lines can be used to enhance productivity and workers’ well-being, provided that the optimal allocation of tasks and available resources can be determined. This study investigates the assembly line balancing problem (ALBP), considering HRC. This problem, abbreviated ALBP-HRC, arises in advanced manufacturing systems, where humans and collaborative robots share the same workplace and can simultaneously perform tasks in parallel or in collaboration. Driven by the need to solve the more complex assembly line-balancing problems found in the automotive industry, this study aims to address the ALBP-HRC with the cycle time and the number of operators (humans and robots) as the primary and secondary objective, respectively. In addition to the traditional ALBP constraints, the human and robot characteristics, in terms of task times, allowing multiple humans and robots at stations, and their joint/collaborative tasks are formulated into a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. A neighborhood-search simulated annealing (SA) is proposed with customized solution representation and neighborhood search operators designed to fit into the problem characteristics. Furthermore, the proposed SA features an adaptive neighborhood selection mechanism that enables the SA to utilize its exploration history to dynamically choose appropriate neighborhood operators as the search evolves. The proposed MILP and SA are implemented on real cases taken from the automotive industry where stations are designed for HRC. The computational results over different problems show that the adaptive SA produces promising solutions compared to the MILP and other swarm intelligence algorithms, namely genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and artificial bee colony. The comparisons of human/robot versus HRC settings in the case study indicate significant improvement in the productivity of the assembly line when multiple humans and robots with collaborative tasks are permissible at stations.

AB  - In the last few decades, there has been a growing necessity for systems that handle market changes and personalized customer needs with near mass production efficiency, defined as the new mass customization paradigm. The Industry 5.0 vision further enhances the human-centricity aspect, in the necessity for manufacturing systems to cooperate with workers, taking advantage of their problem-solving capabilities, creativity, and expertise of the manufacturing process. A solution is to develop a flexible manufacturing system capable of handling different customer requests and real-time decisions from operators. This paper tackles these aspects by proposing a digital twin of a robotic system for solution preparation capable of making real-time scheduling decisions and forecasts using a simulation model while allowing human interventions. A discrete event simulation model was used to forecast possible system improvements. The simulation handles real-time scheduling considering the possibility of adding identical parallel machines. Results show that processing multiple jobs simultaneously with more than one machine on critical processes, increasing the robot speed, and using heuristics that emphasize the shortest transportation time can reduce the overall completion time by 82%. The simulation model has an animated visualization window for a deeper understanding of the system.

AB  - With the emergence of Industry 5.0, the human-centric manufacturing paradigm requires manufacturing equipment(robots, etc.) interactively assist human workers to deal with dynamic and complex production tasks. To achieve symbiotic human-robot interaction (HRI), the safety issue serves as a prerequisite foundation. Regarding the growing individualized demand of manufacturing tasks, the conventional rule-based safe HRI measures could not well address the safety requirements due to inflexibility and lacking synergy. To fill the gap, this work proposes a mutual-cognitive safe HRI approach including worker visual augmentation, robot velocity control, Digital Twin-enabled motion preview/collision detection, and Deep Reinforcement Learning-based robot collision avoidance motion planning in the Augmented Reality-assisted manner. Finally, the feasibility of the system design and the performance of the proposed approach are validated by establishing and executing the prototype HRI system in a practical scene.

AB  - The ongoing Industry 4.0 is characterized by the connectivity between components in the manufacturing system. For modern machines, the Internet of Things is a built-in function. In contrast, there are legacy machines in deployment functioning without digital communication. The need to connect them became popular to improve overall production efficiency. As building a new smart factory as a greenfield investment is a capital-intensive choice, retrofitting the existing infrastructure with IoT capability is more reasonable than replacing them. However, this so-called brownfield development, or retrofitting, requires specific prerequisites, e.g., digitization status assessment, technical and connectivity development, management requirement, and operational need, representing a significant disadvantage: lack of scalability. In the meantime, Industry 5.0 is under human-centric priority, which poses new challenges to the retrofitted system. Aware of the challenge, this paper provides a systematic overview of brownfield development regarding technical difficulties, supporting technologies, and possible applications for the legacy system. The research scope focuses on available Industry 4.0 advancements but considers preparing for the forthcoming Industry 5.0. The proposed retrofitting project approach can be a guideline for manufacturers to transform their factories into intelligent spaces with minimal cost and effort but still gain the most applicable solution for management needs. The future direction for other research in brownfield development for Industry 5.0 is also discussed.

AB  - The Japanese demography is drastically changing. It has seen a rapid increase in the elderly population and a decrease in the birth rate. This caused Japan to be a hyper-ageing society. Japanese’s first Baby-boomers who were born in 1947-1949 are now entering old age. Elderly care is a major problem in Japan. Children and care-workers for elderly parents are scarce. Therefore, the second Baby-boomers (born in 1971-1974) aged 40-50 years old have quit working to care for their elderly parents. This situation is known as ‘kaigo rishoku.’ This study looked into the practice of elderly care in Japanese 5.0 Society. Society 5.0 is a concept developed by Japan. It is human-centred and technology-based. In society 5.0, robots and the internet play an essential role in human life. Therefore, we proposed a critical question: Can robots replace humans to care for the elderly in Society 5.0? This study used the qualitative method with a phenomenological approach and descriptive analysis. The results revealed that although robots can assist elderly care, due to the high cost, only a certain elderly can buy them. Therefore, in order for robots to become caregivers of the future, mass production is needed. Thus, robots can be marketed at relatively lower prices. However, sick elderly who live alone still need human assistance. On the one hand, technology helps human life in Society 5.0. On the other hand, the human touch is still necessary for elderly care.

AB  - Engineering education is key element to the evolution of the global society. The new generations of engineers, following the Industrial Revolutions, and more specifically the upcoming Industry 5.0, require new skills and competencies in order to facilitate this transformation. The scope of the new Industrial Revolution will be to reinforce the Human and Machine Interface (HMI), based on foundations built during the Industry 4.0. Therefore, classic learning models will have to be adapted to this reality. Furthermore, the recent global pandemic has facilitated the development of solutions/platforms for the virtual collaboration for various aspects of everyday life, including professional meetings, educational lectures, academic collaborations, and personal relationships. Taking into consideration the above-mentioned, the key to the creation of more robust and resilient education models, lies on the development of new platforms utilizing cutting-edge technologies, such as Cloud, 5G, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Extended Reality (XR), and Blockchain. Following the mass personalization paradigm implemented in modern manufacturing, a new paradigm, the “Personalized Perception” is introduced, promoting the constant adaptation of education to the skills and competencies of students and generate highly capable engineers by elevating their personal attributes. Therefore, the contribution of this paper is focused on the design and development of a Cloud-based platform supporting the collaboration between engineering students, academic organizations, research organizations, and industrial companies as well. The proposed platform engages technologies such as XR, and Blockchain in order to provide suitable communication channels for collaboration, virtual co-existence, and secure information exchange. Cloud Computing and 5G are utilized in order to support the seamless information flow. Moreover, AI algorithms can be used for supporting simulation tools and for the quantifying student skills and competencies. Consequently, this decentralized platform, promotes the collaboration of the involved parties on a 24/7 basis, providing access to professional tools, complementary to physical presence.

AB  - Over time, industrial revolutions have marked human existence and the work environment, impacting efficiency, effectiveness, and productivity. In the new promoted concept, Industry 5.0, it is expected that humans interact with robots, known as cobots, in a collaborative working space using innovative technologies. This chapter brings some new insights on the way the components of Industry 5.0 readiness model influence value added reported by countries, for the period between 2017 and 2019, on four levels of analysis, namely: (i) country gross value added; (ii) environmental activities value added; (iii) ICT sector value added; (iv) labour productivity. Our results prove that selected components of the Industry 5.0 readiness model determine a positive marginal effect on the value added reported by countries. We also registered a significant influence on the development of the circular economy, in strong relation with the development of the knowledge economy. This highlights the fact that the results of the research are efficiently implemented on manufacturing operations by highly skilled employees, leading to increase firms’ performance, improving at the same time the cooperation between humans and smart machines, as stated in the Industry 5.0 framework.

AB  - While pre-fifth and fifth generation networks have been designed mainly to support machine-to-machine and human-to-human communications via data, audio, and video communications, a major thrust of beyond fifth generation Networks is the abutment of human-to-machine/robot (H2M/R) collaboration. Such collaborations are deeply anchored in the vision of Society 5.0, which promotes a human-centered society that integrates virtual and physical real spaces to resolve social problems, and Industry 5.0, which promotes intelligent manufacturing processes through collaboration between humans and cyber-physical systems. It is expected that real-time H2M/R collaborations will drive new technologies that facilitate the low-latency exchange of control signals and haptic feedback between humans and machines/robots. The low-latency constraints for real-time interaction will, however, place limits on deployable distance and the flexibility of adding new machines/robots to the system. The scalability of H2M/R collaborations across large geographical distances that also allow rapid onboarding of new machines/robots is therefore an open challenge. This article focuses on global-local AI coordinated learning (GLAD), a solution framework that supports the dynamic addition of new machines/robots and their rapid onboarding. The GLAD framework is based on learning the traffic characteristics and correlation of supported robots/machines at the local edge and global cloud. Harnessing data samples from a real H2M/R application for training and validation, GLAD enables human operators to remotely control machines/robots over extended distances through accurately forecasting their haptic feedback. By globally coordinating and sharing this learning across the network, up to 72 percent of the time can be saved when onboarding new machines/robots.

AB  - The industrial revolution 4.0 presents challenges that must be faced by the business world, namely the lack of adequate HR (Human Resource) skills, the problem of security of communication technology, the reliability of the stability of production machines, the inability to change by stakeholders, and the number of job losses due to automation. Society 5.0 offers a human-centered society that makes a balance between economic progress and the resolution of social problems through a system that is highly connected through cyberspace and the real world. If society 4.0 allows anyone to access also share information on the internet. Society 5.0 is an era where all technology is part of humanity itself. To take advantage of opportunities and answer the challenges of the industrial revolution 4.0, Indonesian people in particular are required to have data, technology and human literacy capabilities. Data literacy is needed by HR to improve skills in processing and analyzing big data for the benefit of improving public and business services. Technology literacy shows the ability to utilize digital technology to process data and information, while human literacy must be mastered because it shows the element of soft skills or the development of individual character to be able to collaborate, be adaptive, and innovative. Indonesia is demanded to be able to follow industry 4.0 workflows juxtaposed with society 5.0. The need for human resources in several business fields is still very massive if all of them are carried out by robotics. Indonesia is a developing country with a fairly dense population that is certainly able to align between the needs of industry 4.0 and society 5.0. Leadership in organizations must stay alive so that every innovative competitive strategy is able to run with the existing vision. To go to the era of society 5.0 the government is obliged to continuously control it.

AB  - Technological advances have made possible industrial and commercial applications of artificial intelligence, virtual reality and highly integrated manufacturing systems. It has also freed business activity from a focus on place, as both work activities and markets have been able to harness information and communication technologies in order to operate remotely. As a result, researchers have highlighted a phenomenon of ‘smart’ working. Some have pointed to a fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) in which ‘smart’ factories use robotics to achieve high performance. There is now a suggestion of progress towards Industry 5.0, in which technological and social systems work in harmony to deliver personalised mass customization of products and services. This paper examines these developments from the perspective of unique, individual understandings of work roles and sustainability, posing the questions ‘Smart’ from whose point of view? Do smart systems promote sustainable organizations? How should design of smart systems be approached? It suggests that contemporary socio-technical systems approaches to organizational analysis are the best way to support harnessing of smart technologies in organizations.

AB  - Industry 5.0 vision, a step toward the next industrial revolution and
enhancement to Industry 4.0, envisioned the new goals of resilient,
sustainable, and human-centric approaches in diverse emerging applications,
e.g., factories-of-the-future, digital society. The vision seeks to leverage
human intelligence and creativity in nexus with intelligent, efficient, and
reliable cognitive collaborating robots (cobots) to achieve zero waste,
zerodefect, and mass customization-based manufacturing solutions. However, the
vision requires the merging of cyber-physical worlds through utilizing Industry
5.0 technological enablers, e.g., cognitive cobots, person-centric artificial
intelligence (AI), cyberphysical systems, digital twins, hyperconverged data
storage and computing, communication infrastructure, and others. In this
regard, the convergence of the emerging computational intelligence (CI)
paradigm and next-generation wireless networks (NGWNs) can fulfill the
stringent communication and computation requirements of the technological
enablers in the Industry 5.0 vision, which is the aim of this survey-based
tutorial. In this article, we address this issue by reviewing and analyzing
current emerging concepts and technologies, e.g., CI tools and frameworks,
network-in-box architecture, open radio access networks, softwarized service
architectures, potential enabling services, and others, essential for designing
the objectives of CINGWNs to fulfill the Industry 5.0 vision requirements.
Finally, we provide a list of lessons learned from our detailed review,
research challenges, and open issues that should be addressed in CI-NGWNs to
realize Industry 5.0.

AB  - Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has shown industries all around the world that their current manufacturing systems are not as resilient as expected and therefore many are failing. The workforce is the most agile and flexible manufacturing resource and simultaneously the most fragile one due to its humanity. By making human operators more resilient against a range of factors affecting their work and workplaces, enterprises can make their manufacturing systems more resilient. This paper introduces “The Resilient Operator 5.0” concept, based on human operator resilience and human-machine systems’ resilience, providing a vision for the future of work in smart resilient manufacturing systems in the emerging Industry 5.0 hallmark. It suggests how to achieve appropriate smart manufacturing systems’ resilience from a human-centric perspective through the means of the Operator 4.0 typology and its related technical solutions.

AB  - One of the main objective of the fifth industrial revolution is the design and implementation of human-centric production environments. The human is, indeed, placed in the center of the production environment, having a supervision/leading role instead of carrying out heavy/repetitive tasks. To enhance such an industrial paradigm change, industrial operators have to be provided with the tools they need to naturally and easily transfer their knowledge to robotic systems. Such expertise, in fact, is difficult to be coded, especially for non-expert programmers. In addition, due to the reduced specialized manpower, the capability to transfer such a knowledge into robotic systems is becoming increasingly critical and demanded. In response to this need, this contribution aims to propose and validate a human-centric approach to transfer the human’s knowledge of a task into the robot controller making use of qualitative feedback only (to this end, preference-based optimization is employed). In addition, the modelled human’s knowledge is exploited by an optimization algorithm (i.e., nonlinear programming) to maximize the task performance while managing the task constraints. The proposed approach has been implemented and validated for a robotic sealant material deposition task. On the basis of the qualitative feedback provided by the operator, the knowledge related to the deposition task has been transferred to the robotic system and optimized to deal with the hardware and task constraints. The achieved results show the generalization of the approach, making it possible to optimize the deposition task output.

AB  - In the present era of technological advancement and rapid change, mankind faces different kinds of challenges. The product lifecycle has been shortened dramatically, and the manufacturing industry is moving from mass production to the high personalization of mass products. This era is widely known as the fourth industrial revolution or Industry 4.0 (I4.0). It seems that soon it will be inevitable for every society. The paper briefly focuses on empirical insights into the impact of I4.0 on various sectors of society. The traditional approaches to manufacturing, servicing, and public policy planning will no longer remain effective and would be transformed. I4.0 should be observed as an Opportunity 4.0 and draw attention to the industry, academia, and policymakers’ in changing scenarios. Expectations from them are also underlined. Its favorable features in the post-COVID-19 era are also discussed. This short article invites attention to foresee beyond I4.0, e.g. Industry 5.0 and more such progressions.

AB  - Human-machine work system (HMWS) is a composite system that combines the accuracy and strength of machines in repetitive work with the advantages of humans in cognitive ability, flexibility, and adaptability to perform various tasks with a common goal, which is getting smarter in the era of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and has received extensive attention from academia and industry. However, due to a lack of real-time information sharing during the implementation and operation of HMWS, the uncertainty brought by human instability and the increasing complexity caused by smart networking environments in the context of I4.0 bring difficulties to the synchronous coordination of this distributed human-centric manufacturing system, while the failure of synchronization will lead to serious violation of overall system integrity, resulting in unrealistic decision-making results and even harmful to human health, which also goes against the propose of Industry 5.0 (I5.0) to put human well-being at the center of the production process to achieve human-centric smart manufacturing in the future. In this context, this research presents a real-time data-driven hyper objects orchestrating for the human-machine synchronization ( RHYTHMS ) based on a service-oriented human-to-machine architecture (SOH2M) and a model reference adaptive fuzzy control for real-time information sharing and synchronous coordination of the smart HMWS. Based on these, a real-life assembly case is carried out by a full-scale HMWS prototype to quantitatively analyze the benefits of the proposed approach in proactive ergonomic risks mitigation (PERM), contributing to the human-centric value-oriented I5.0 era.

AB  - The innovation driven Industry 5.0, in agreement with Industry 4.0, leads to consider human in a prominence position as the center of manufacturing field. This pushes towards the hybridization of manufacturing plants promoting a fully collaboration between human and robot. Furthermore, the new paradigm of "human centred design" and "anthropocentric design" allows enabling a synergistic combination of human and robot skills. However, properly collaborative workplaces are currently very few. Industry is still not confident, and systems integrators hesitate to venture into Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC). Despite the effort in collaborative robotics, a general solution to overcome the current limitations in designing of collaborative workplaces still misses. In the current work, a Knowledge-Based Approach (KBA) is adopted to face collaborative workplace designing problem. The framework resulting from the KBA allows developing a modelling paradigm that enable to define a streamlined approach for the layout designing of a collaborative workplace. Finally, a what-if analysis and a ANOVA analysis are performed to generate and evaluate a set of scenarios related to a collaborative workplace for quality inspection of welded parts. Facing the high complexity and multidisciplinary of HRC can be conveyed to develop a general design approach aimed at overcoming the difficulties that limit the spread of HRC in the manufacturing field.

AB  - The new Industry 5.0 paradigm complements the well-known Industry 4.0 approach by specifically driving research and innovation to facilitate the transition to sustainable, human-centric and resilient industry. In the manufacturing context, workers' diversity in terms of experience, productivity and physical capacity represents a significant challenge for companies, especially those characterized by high staff turnover and manual processes with high workload and poor ergonomics. In seeking to address such challenges, this research adopts a human-centric perspective to define new flexible job arrangements by developing a new multi-objective job rotation scheduling model. The proposed model is unique in that it aims to achieve multiple job assignment objectives by simultaneously considering different socio-technical factors: workers' experience, physical capacity and limitations, postural ergonomic risks, noise and vibration exposure, and workers' boredom. The model's implementation in real environments can be supported by new sensor-based technologies that collect data on workers' efficiency, ergonomic scores and task performance and enable workers to participate in measuring perceived fatigue and boredom. The primary goal of our model is to find the most appropriate assignment of job and individual-flexible rest-break plan for each worker. The authors test the model application in an industrial setting. Useful managerial insights emerge and prescriptive recommendations are provided.

AB  - The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in a smart society, in which the analysis of human habits is mandatory, requires automated data scheduling and analysis using smart applications, a smart infrastructure, smart systems, and a smart network. In this context, which is characterized by a large gap between training and operative processes, a dedicated method is required to manage and extract the massive amount of data and the related information mining. The method presented in this work aims to reduce this gap with near-zero-failure advanced diagnostics (AD) for smart management, which is exploitable in any context of Society 5.0, thus reducing the risk factors at all management levels and ensuring quality and sustainability. We have also developed innovative applications for a human-centered management system to support scheduling in the maintenance of operative processes, for reducing training costs, for improving production yield, and for creating a human–machine cyberspace for smart infrastructure design. The results obtained in 12 international companies demonstrate a possible global standardization of operative processes, leading to the design of a near-zero-failure intelligent system that is able to learn and upgrade itself. Our new method provides guidance for selecting the new generation of intelligent manufacturing and smart systems in order to optimize human–machine interactions, with the related smart maintenance and education.

AB  - Needs for new competences and knowledge arise as industry 4.0 evolves in increasingly digitalized production. This development entails that job transformations and future skills need attention from the perspective of industry 5.0, where human and machine find ways of working together to improve production performance. Facing this perspective, one challenge is a growing need for novel lifelong learning initiatives, to meet emerging and altering occupations for the fulfilment of future skill requirements. This challenge is addressed here by portraying a case where three Swedish universities have formed a distinctive collaboration to develop a flexible (i.e. blended) course for professionals, in the subject of Digitally-enabled production. The purpose is to develop a sustainable collaboration between the universities and create a course format on master level addressing lifelong learning for the increasingly digitalized production. The ambition is to increase the impact of the universities respective efforts by sharing resources and utilizing individual specialized expertise to develop a practical and relevant course that can reach a larger target group. The course encompasses industry 4.0 readiness on three levels of production systems; plant-, production cell-, and component level; to adopt a holistic view of digitalization in production. We followed an action research approach for continuously collecting and documenting our experiences during the course development, implementation, and dissemination of the course. Within the frame of action research, an explorative case study describes and analyzes the initiative. The results highlight challenges and opportunities for succeeding with this form of co-produced course. The joint course gives professionals possibilities to work on cases from their own companies with expert supervision from three manufacturing levels to address complex challenges in industry 4.0 implementation. To conclude, the importance of lifelong learning in relation to the human-centric approach of industry 5.0 is emphasized as a future direction.

AB  - The outbreak of the COVID pandemic revealed that supply chains are not resilient to such a type of turmoil, and the food industry appeared to be particularly vulnerable. Meanwhile, customers expect uninterrupted deliveries and the products' selection responding to their preferences. In the article, we discuss several topics related to supply management that allow preparing a delivery plan for a distributed network of vending machines, considering each location individually. The developed solution takes advantage of the state-of-the-art machine learning methods. However, it is human-centric and aligned with the concept of Industry 5.0. We present the conceptual and technological side of the solution with a particular emphasis on the developed feature extraction framework, which uses selected indicators from the survival analysis. We present an analysis of the real data confirming that the proposed approach copes well with high uncertainty in data, addressing the cold-start problem.

AB  - The research objective of the present article is to study new world trends in industrial deve¬lopment and the reaction speed of national governments, companies and workers to technological changes. As research methods, analysis and synthesis of current world trends were applied, as well as special methods were used: expert assessments of international organizations were analyzed, a comparative and economic-statistical analysis was carried out. As a result, the distinctive features of Industry 5.0 are highlighted – this is the coexistence of industry and new social and environmental trends and needs. Change is inevitable: green energy and sustainable products will initially be a monopoly factor and benefit insiders. It is emphasized that in order to achieve global competitiveness, companies need to transform established business models and invest in technology and network forms of business, taking into account social goals: in addition to creating new jobs and ensuring flexible employment, we are talking about personalization of goods and greening. The poli¬tical and economic goals of the fifth industrial revolution and the direction of technological innovations are considered. It is emphasized that technology, according to the new approach, should serve people and society, which means that the technology used in production adapts to the needs and diversity of industry workers. The leaders are artificial intelligence, quantum information and semiconductors. Technological transformation is based on the development of the following areas: individual technologies for human-machine interaction, biotechnology and smart materials, artificial intelligence, digital twins, data transmission, storage and analysis technologies, as well as energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, storage and autonomy. It is an ecosystem-based innovation policy with a flexible focus on results. It is noted that technological transformation will help solve a number of unique social problems. It puts a bold focus from individual technologies to a system approach that allows the industry to achieve social goals beyond job creation and growth, and puts the well-being of industry workers at the center of the production process. In conclusion, the techno-social nature of the fifth revolution is revealed, with technology as tools and social needs as the ultimate goal.

AB  - Developing technologies, advancement in science, evolving globalized perspectives and the massive dependence on digital platform for a routine sustenance has led to the core building of Industry 4.0. In general, industry 4.0 focuses on the metamorphosis of all industrial components with the help of strong digital support. It's very often interlinked with the successful fourth industrial revolution. It is to be noted that the very fourth outburst of industrialization plunges forward in order to achieve an optimized and sustained form of production. With the uplift of the fourth generation of this stirring revolution, the efficient extraction of advanced informatics analytics along with internetworked machines have grown to a great extent, complementing the digital platform. On the other hand, society 5.0 involves a human centric community which is capable of striking a balance between the economical proliferations and resolving societal liabilities by the core combination of cyber and physical space. Just like how industry 4.0 carries out the digital transformation of every industrial perspective, society 5.0 encourages mundane life to leap towards a digital revamp expanding across different tiers of the community. Indeed, the rapid change of information and Communication Technology along with the portrayal of society 5.0 as a global trend and a key aspect of the Science and Technology Basic plan, the interplay of the two proves to be a constant support for each other. This paper discusses about the future look of industry 4.0 and society 5.0 and elaborates on the challenges and opportunities rooted from them.

AB  - The European Commission defined the new concept of Industry 5.0 meaning a more human-centric, resilient, and sustainable approach for the design of industrial systems and operations. A deep understanding of the work environment and organization is important to start analysing the working conditions and the resulting User eXperience (UX) of the operators. Also, the knowledge about users’ needs and ergonomics is fundamental to optimize the workers’ wellbeing, working conditions, and industrial results. In this context, the paper presents a strategy to effectively assess the UX of workers to promote human-centric vision of manufacturing sites, enhancing the overall sustainability of the modern factories. A set of non-invasive wearable devices is used to monitor human activities and collect physiological parameters, as well as questionnaires to gather subjective self-assessment. This set-up was applied to virtual reality (VR) simulation, replicating heavy duty work sequence tasks that took place in an oil and gas pipes manufacturing site. This approach allowed the identification of possible stressful conditions for the operator, from physical and mental perspectives, which may compromise the performance. This research was funded by the European Community's HORIZON 2020 programme under grant agreement No. 958303 (PENELOPE).

AB  - The integration of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies within society is pivotal for resolving many challenges that the world and its population are facing presently—global pandemics, ageing populations, and climate change. However, academics and practitioners still struggle to fully understand I4.0 outcomes outside of the manufacturing domain, thereby unravelling their potential for society at large. In this scenario, Society 5.0 (S5.0) is arising as a new paradigm that places humans at the centre of innovation. To foster the effective integration of technology into society and to better understand how to design S5.0 configurations and solutions, the authors developed a conceptual model applying the Design Thinking (DT) approach to the Quintuple Helix (QH) innovation framework. The proposed QH–DT model was found to be suitable for allowing the knowledge flow among the actors involved in the design and implementation of the S5.0 solution. The model was then explained through its application in a healthcare project—the SMARTAGE. By adopting an action research methodology, the results explain how it becomes possible to build complex human-centric healthcare solutions.

AB  - In the context of factory digitization, the focus of Industry 4.0 initiative is to leverage the automation and data exchange in manufacturing processes using automation, IoT, and advanced technologies. Industry 5.0 has emerged as the next industrial revolution, to adopt a human-centric approach for digital technologies. That said, having people, robots, smart machines, and intelligent production systems working together raises challenges in terms of monitoring and securing the production environment. In other words, the complexity of smart factories makes it possible for incidents to occur and interrupt the manufacturing process. They might also cause leaking sensitive information or putting the worker’s life in danger as well. Accordingly, designing secure architectures in intelligent factories is crucial to secure a continuous production lifecycle and safe working conditions. Nonetheless, due to the decentralized environment of modern factories, creating multi-domain data correlation is crucial to obtain universal monitoring of the occurring events, as well as to establish cyber situational awareness and adopt suitable countermeasures in case of attacks. For these purposes, we developed a holistic multi-domain security and safety mechanism for Factories of the Future. Our approach consists of individual but integrated modules, each of which is responsible for capturing alerts from different domains of the factory. Alerts are then handled by an intelligent correlator to inspect possible attacks or malfunctions on the investigated shop floor. In this paper, we describe the architecture and design of the developed approach.

AB  - The human-centered design (HCD) approach places humans at the center of design in order to improve both products and processes, and to give users an effective, efficient and satisfying interactive experience. In industrial design and engineering, HCD is very useful in helping to achieve the novel Industry 5.0 concept, based on improving workers’ wellbeing by providing prosperity beyond jobs and growth, while respecting the production limits of the planet as recently promoted by the European Commission. In this context, the paper proposes an ergonomic assessment method based on the analysis of the workers’ workload to support the design of industrial products and processes. This allows the simultaneous analysis of the physical and cognitive workload of operators while performing their tasks during their shift. The method uses a minimum set of non-invasive wearable devices to monitor human activity and physiological parameters, in addition to questionnaires for subjective self-assessment. The method has been preliminarily tested on a real industrial case in order to demonstrate how it can help companies to support the design of optimized products and processes promoting the workers’ wellbeing.

AB  - In 2016, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced in the 2015 national tax survey that Japan's population is decreasing . In 2018, the Cabinet Office announced Society 5.0, which showed the future of Japan, "A human-centered society that realize both economic development and social issues resolve with the highly synchronized system between cyber space (virtual space) and physical space (real space). On the other hand, in 2015, the United Nations declared the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) "17 goals and 169 targets to realize a sustainable world, then leave no one behind". In Japan, in order to realize this future, measures are being taken to improve productivity in companies through work style reforms and to develop the "problem-seeking ability" of university students through educational reforms. This paper proposes next-generation artificial intelligence as the technology that solve Japan domestic problems (securing production methods to compensate for population decline) and exercise Japan leadership to contribute to the achievement of SDGs goals. This is also a proposal for a social model in which new technology realizes the happiness of all people.

AB  - Recent advances in materials modelling, characterization and materials informatics suggest that deep integration of such methods can be a crucial aspect of the Industry 5.0 revolution, where the fourth industrial revolution paradigms are combined with the concepts of transition to a sustainable, human-centric and resilient industry. We pose a specific deep integration challenge beyond the ordinary multidisciplinary modelling/characterization research approach in this short communication with research and innovation as drivers for scientific excellence. Full integration can be achieved by developing common ontologies across different domains, enabling meaningful computational and experimental data integration and interoperability. On this basis, fine-tuning of adaptive materials modelling/characterization protocols can be achieved and facilitate computational and experimental efforts. Such interoperable and meaningful data combined with advanced data science tools (including machine learning and artificial intelligence) become a powerful asset for materials scientists to extract complex information from the large amount of data generated by last generation characterization techniques. To achieve this ambitious goal, significant collaborative actions are needed to develop common, usable, and sharable digital tools that allow for effective and efficient twinning of data and workflows across the different materials modelling and characterization domains.

AB  - In this paper we introduce a research agenda to guide the development of the next generation of Discrete Event Simulation (DES) systems. Interfaces to digital twins are projected to go beyond physical representations to become blueprints for the actual “objects” and an active dashboard for their control. The role and importance of real-time interactive animations presented in an Extended Reality (XR) format will be explored. The need for using game engines, particularly their physics engines and AI within interactive simulated Extended Reality is expanded on. Importing and scanning real-world environments is assumed to become more efficient when using AR. Exporting to VR and AR is recommended to be a default feature. A technology framework for the next generation simulators is presented along with a proposed set of implementation guidelines. The need for more human centric technology approaches, nascent in Industry 4.0, are now central to the emerging Industry 5.0 paradigm; an agenda that is discussed in this research as part of a human in the loop future, supported by DES. The potential role of Explainable Artificial Intelligence is also explored along with an audit trail approach to provide a justification of complex and automated decision-making systems with relation to DES. A technology framework is proposed, which brings the above together and can serve as a guide for the next generation of holistic simulators for manufacturing.

AB  - Fish constitute important high protein products to meet the demands of an increasing global population. However, the continued depletion of wild fish stocks is leading to increased strain on the aquaculture sector in terms of sustaining the supply of fish and seafood to global markets. Despite the fact that aquaculture is more diversified than other agriculture sectors, there are significant pressures on the industry to continue innovating in order to enable sustainability including increased fish production, improved appropriate selection of species, disease mitigation, reduced wastage, preventing environmental pollution and generating more employment globally. This viewpoint article addresses how digital transformation can help support and meet expansion needs of the fisheries/aquaculture industries that includes exploiting and harnessing ICT, IoT, Cloud-edge computing, AI, machine learning, immersive technologies and blockchain. Digital technologies are bringing significant operational benefits for global food chain, improving efficiencies and productivity, reducing waste, contamination and food fraud. The focus on digital technologies has recently evolved to Industry 5.0 where AI and robotics are coupled with the human mind in order to advance human-centric solutions. This viewpoint describes the role of Quadruple helix Hub (academic-industry-government and society) in delivering a convergent holistic approach to meeting the diversity of fishery industry needs by connecting and placing fisheries centrally in a defined ecosystem of stakeholders. This includes specialist training, testing technologies, providing access to finance and fostering disruption through aquaculture accelerator initiatives such as that provided by Hatch Blue. Connecting digital Innovation Hubs trans-regionally, nationally and internationally will also help mitigate against significant risks for the fisheries and aquaculture industry including climate change, global pandemics and conflicts that can jeopardize fish and seafood production and supply chains. There is also a commensurate need to avail of digital technologies in order to increase awareness of key industry issues across the value chain, such as through social marketing. Thus, addressing key challenges by way of the global digital transformation of fishery and aquaculture industry will meet several sustainable development goals of the United Nations catered around the application of disruptive technology.

AB  - In the futuristic Industry framework, user interactions with the product are seamlessly integrated with the product life cycle which results in Information overload. The shopbots were proposed in Industry 4.0 where the more focus was on process automation. In this research work, we propose recommender system for industry 5.0 which is based on collaboration of human beings and machines with more focus on user’s personalization. Recommender system can be considered as an information filtering tool that provides suggestions to users about products, music, friend, topic, etc. This suggestion is based on the interest of users. Several research works have been carried out to improve recommendation accuracy by using matrix factorization, trust-based, hybrid-based, machine learning, and deep learning techniques. However, very few existing works have leveraged textual opinions for the recommendation to the best of our knowledge. Existing research works have focused only on numerical ratings, which do not reflect actual user behaviour. In this research work, sentiments of textual opinions are analysed for an in-depth analysis of user’s behaviour. Recommendation accuracy is improved by using the proposed score Recop which is calculated from opinion sentiments. Furthermore, the sparsity issue is resolved by using our proposed approach. Amazon and Yelp review datasets are used for Experiment analysis. Mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values are improved significantly using the proposed approach compared to the existing approaches. MAE and RMSE scores on the Yelp dataset are 0.85 and 1.51, respectively. Additionally, MAE and RMSE scores on the Amazon dataset are 0.66 and 0.93, respectively, which clearly reflects the significant contribution of our proposed approach.

AB  - This chapter goes beyond simply defining terms by providing an overview of the entire technology and data ecosystem (within and beyond the food industry) so that readers are able to differentiate between Blockchain, cryptocurrency and ledgers, as well as smart contracts and the cloud. A deep look at disruptive technology and innovation in retail highlights the diversity of the future of food safety technology. Food systems and food supply chains (FSCs) have undergone significant changes in their operations and structure over the last decade as globalization expands both food choice and availability. As FSCs lengthen, and food passes through extended trading relationships, transparency on food origins, methods of cultivation, harvest, processing as well as labor conditions and sustainability are reduced, along with food trust. Moreover, while the rapid pace of technology innovation benefits FSCs, we are witness to the usage of social media platforms by citizen-consumers to amplify the rhetoric related to recurring incidents and crises in food quality, food safety, food fraud, food security, sustainability, and other ethical lapses. Furthermore, we are witness to new evidence on the global burden of foodborne diseases, including noncommunicable diseases that range from severe malnutrition to morbid obesity and from severe illnesses requiring hospitalization to mortality. The World Health Organization claims that 31 foodborne hazards cause 600 million illnesses and 420,000 deaths annually. Overcoming these challenges requires a holistic reframing of our food systems and societal challenges. The emergence of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provides an overarching framework for collaboration and alignment. Japan has put forward a vision for a human-centric, technology-enabled future branded as “Society 5.0.” Increasingly, the redesign of FSCs necessitates a concerted, multistakeholder effort and the development of digitization strategies in order to cope with the evolution toward the vision of Society 5.0 and to achieve the UN SDGs.

AB  - Purpose: Despite the significant attention that Industry 4.0 (I4.0) has gained in the last decade, little importance has been given to shop-floor workers' role in effectively implementing these new technologies in production systems. Nowadays, several authors discuss the need to bring workers back to the center of the decision-making about implementing the new technologies in what is being called Industry 5.0 (I5.0). A key factor of using these new concepts is that it must make sense, and the new information generated by these technologies must have a precise use; otherwise, it will be considered waste. The Lean approach is already recognized as the best approach to identify and eliminate waste from production systems. Not only that, but it allows decisions about process improvement to be human-centric. Thus, this article aims to present the main aspects and evolution of I4.0 and I5.0 over time, using the Lean approach as the analysis lenses.
 Study design/methodology/approach: In order to identify the mains aspects of I4.0 and I5.0, we develop a consistent literature review using the Systematic Search Flow (SSF).
 Findings: As a result, it was possible to identify the evolution from I4.0 to I5.0, In I4.0, the main focus was on developing new technologies, combine them with classic Lean tools (e.g. Kanban 4.0, Poka-Yoke 4.0) and implement Cyber-Physical Systems. In I5.0, the focus is to use these new technologies together with shop floor workers to continuously improve production processes. Not only that, but in I5.0, the protagonist becomes (or return to become) the shop floor workers to lead the improvements, as is in the Toyota Kata approach.
 Originality/value: This work presents a new way of interpreting the progression of concepts from I4.0 to I5.0. In addition, the focus on workers for problem solving is returning to the center of the discussion. Together with the technologies of I4.0, this represents a new area for future research.

AB  - The Digital Transformation (DX) megatrend is fundamentally disrupting and changing the nature of work, business, and industry at a rapid pace. Although the notion of DX has garnered much research interest from practitioners, scholarship on this topic is somehow lagging behind, possibly because of the lack of theoretical frameworks on DX. Recently, most Japanese firms have begun to use diverse digital technologies to sustain their competitive advantages. However, the return of investment on digital technologies has not been as high as expected for some firms. Furthermore, as the visions of Industry 5.0 describe sustainable, resilient, and human-centered future factories that will require smart and resilient capabilities both from next-generation manufacturing systems and human operators, it is necessary to design resilient human–machine collaborations within factories. To this end, this paper presents a research model between DX technologies and scientific problem-solving in terms of deduction, induction, and abduction inference structures as an approach to resilient human–machine collaborations. The purpose of this research is to analyze the difference in the utilization pattern of the digital technology of American, German, and Japanese firms based on three types of decision-making methods. Next, we apply this framework in a comparative case study of two Japanese firms and one German firm, where we find that there is a difference in DX technologies utilization among the Japanese and German firms. We assert that the utilization of IoT technology in the United States and Germany is pursuing IoT with the aim of autonomous control, whereas Japanese firms prioritize robot–human collaboration. Finally, we discuss how our findings contribute to the burgeoning field of resilient human–machine collaborations by showing the distinct roles of deduction, induction, and abduction inference structures. Furthermore, our research contributes to international comparative studies to identify the difference in national IT utilization. Lessons and implications are discussed.

AB  - Production systems are being expanded to include Digital Twins (DTs) as part of increased industrial digitalization. DTs can bring benefits e.g., increase visibility, safety, and accessibility of the system. Further, digital experimentation can reduce time and cost. Though, application of DT technologies involves challenges i.e., model accuracy or errors in transferring data or codes between the DT and the physical twin. Many studies on DTs focus on industrial applications. However, DT technology has potential for implementation of digital labs in education. This aspect of DTs is of rising importance as distance education has increased over the last decade and access to physical laboratories can be restricted due to factors such as the Covid-19 pandemic. Thus, there is a need to study the use of DT technology in higher education. To address this, we investigate possibilities and challenges of applying DT technology in education to conduct industrial-like labs virtually. A case of an automation line, with full scale industrial equipment, based at a research center, is focused. Results emphasize that the application of DT technologies require multi-domain expertise to understand the consequences of every single decision in the design process on every piece of equipment involved, making the modelling process complex and time consuming. Thus, when applied in education, test procedures need to be designed to focus on students’ motivation, improved learning and understanding of production systems. DTs are considered enabling technologies supporting the concept of Industry 5.0, thus stressing the human-centric aspects of advancing Industry 4.0. The predicted application of DTs emphasizes the need for educational curricula that include laboratory applications and theoretic understanding of DT technologies. This study focusses the application of DT technologies in higher education curricula, but the result of the study can contribute to other areas such as automation and virtual commissioning towards smarter manufacturing.

AB  - Increasing volatility and product individualization are leading to higher complexity in manual assembly. At the same time, production and processes must become more flexible, and humans have to adapt to new products more often and even faster. Industry 5.0 will increasingly focus on human-centric approaches, on the collaboration of humans and machines intensively using cognitive assistance systems. The design of an innovative cognitive assistance system is a complex task due to the many technological opportunities and their interrelationships. In the framework of this research, a method was developed enabling the systematic design of cognitive assistance systems that integrates business and worker requirements aiming at improving productivity, quality, worker satisfaction and well-being. The research question was approached by design science research having, as the main output, a systematic and innovative method for the design of cognitive assistance systems based on quality function deployment (QFD), referred to as cognitive assistance system-QFD (CAS-QFD). The developed methodology is divided into six phases and includes the iterative design of a cognitive assistance system starting from the assembly process. The method considers the information needs of the workers, the definition of the appropriate assistance functions and the selection of the interaction technologies. The exemplarily industrial evaluation highlighted the relevance of CAS-QFD for systematically designing cognitive assistance systems based on holistic requirements, identified at the worker, workplace, production area and, finally, at the enterprise level.

AB  - Korean Abstract: 본 연구는 우리 정부가 추진하고 있는 혁신성장 정책에 초점을 맞춰 미국, 유럽, 일본의 혁신성장 정책 추진 현황을 분석하고 정책적 시사점을 도출하는 데 목적이 있다. 우선 미국, 유럽, 일본과 같은 주요국의 혁신성장 패러다임의 특징을 분석함으로써 우리 정부의 혁신성장 패러다임에 대한 시사점을 도출하였다. 이어 4차 산업혁명 관련 주요 분야 중 스마트팩토리, 창업생태계(스타트업), 핀테크와 같은 3가지 분야를 선정하고, 우리 정부와 주요국 정부의 정책을 비교ㆍ분석하여 보다 구체적인 정책적 제언을 제공하는 것에 초점을 맞췄다. 제2장에서는 우선 미국의 민간 주도형 혁신과 이를 뒷받침하고 있는 4차 산업혁명 분야(첨단제조업, IoT, AI, 빅데이터) 관련 미국정부의 정책을 분석하였다. 정부 차원에서는 연방정부의 분야별 전략 아래 개별부처 및 유관기관이 구체적인 실행계획을 추진하고 있으며, 이들을 조정하는 범부처기관을 설치하여 정보 공유와 기관 간 협력을 도모하고 있다. 민간 부문에서는 ‘산업인터넷 컨소시엄(IIC)’ 등을 통해 첨단기술의 상용화 실험 및 검증 작업이 활발하게 진행되고 있는 것으로 나타났다. 마지막으로 사례 분석을 통해서는 디지털 플랫폼 기업의 성장 과정에서 정책의 역할을 간과할 수 없다는 점을 확인하였으며, 이를 통해 정부의 정책과 민간기업의 전략 간 연계가 미국 혁신성장의 핵심임을 파악했다. 이어 ‘하이테크 전략’을 시작으로 ‘인더스트리 4.0’ 및 ‘디지털 전략 2025’를 거쳐 ‘AI 전략’에 이르기까지 독일 연방정부의 정책에 나타난 혁신성장 패러다임의 변화를 살펴보았다. 특히 전 세계적으로 충격적인 변화를 가져온 독일정부의 ‘인더스트리 4.0’ 개념은 네트워킹을 통해 모든 정보를 활용하고 이를 기반으로 최적의 가치흐름을 도출하는 것을 의미하며, 제조업의 디지털화와 연관성이 높다. 독일의 혁신성장은 산관학 협력이 핵심이며, 구체적인 적용사례 소개 및 테스트베드 제공 등을 통해 실현되고 있다. 산관학 협력을 대표하는 연구기관인 프라운호퍼는 ‘등대 프로젝트(lighthouse project)’를 통해 기업이 주도하기에는 한계가 있는 연구를 대신 수행하여 빠른 시일 내에 상용화될 수 있도록 지원하고 있다. 한편 일본정부는 새로운 미래 사회상으로 ‘소사이어티 5.0’을 제시하였는데, 이는 IoT 기술을 기반으로 데이터를 수집하고 AI 및 로봇 등을 통해 빅데이터를 활용하는 사회를 의미한다. 특히 일본은 강점을 지닌 산업데이터를 활용하여 제조업 분야의 경쟁력을 확보하고자 ‘커넥티드 인더스트리즈 (Connected Industries)’라는 정책을 시행 중이다. 일본은 무엇보다도 빅데이터의 활용을 강조하고 있는데, 산업데이터 공유사업 인증제도를 도입하고 산업 IoT 플랫폼 간 연계 프로젝트를 지원하고 있다는 점이 특징이다. 최근에는 내각부 내 종합과학기술ㆍ이노베이션회의라는 과학기술ㆍ이노베이션 컨트롤타워를 설치하여 보다 일관된 실행체계를 갖추게 되었다. 제3장에서는 스마트팩토리에 대한 개념 설명을 시작으로 독일과 일본 스마트팩토리의 현황과 관련 정책에 대해 서술하고 있다. 우선 독일은 스마트팩토리 구축 및 활용 정도가 확대되고 있는 상황이며, 이와 더불어 OPC UA(Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture) umati와 같은 스마트 팩토리 연결 메커니즘 및 표준에 대한 관심이 높아지고 있다. 독일 스마트팩토리의 구체적인 사례로는 지멘스, 보쉬, SAP의 사례를 참고할 수 있으며, 독일연방경제에너지부(BMWi)는 스마트팩토리의 바탕이 되는 디지털 변환을 지원하고자 ‘미텔슈탄트 4.0 역량센터’를 활용하고 있는 것으로 나타났다. 일본은 아직까지 가상팩토리 단계에 미치지 못하고 제조공정의 혁신에 초점을 맞추고 있으며, 스마트팩토리에 대한 관심도 비교적 낮다고 볼 수 있다. 일본의 제조공정 혁신은 디지털화 및 표준화, 가시화, 자동화 측면에서 이루어지고 있으며, 공장 간 또는 부문 간 연결을 위해 미쓰비시전기의 엣지크로스, 화낙의 필드시스템과 같은 산업용 IoT 플랫폼이 등장하였다. 한편 일본정부는 IoT 도입을 중심으로 한 기업 맞춤형 지원을 제공하고 있는데, 구체적으로 홍보활동, 전문가 파견 및 IoT 툴 지원, IoT 세제, IoT 투자에 대한 자금지원을 시행 중이다. 제4장에서는 미국, 일본, 프랑스의 스타트업 생태계 현황과 관련 정책에 대 해 살펴보았다. 미국의 스타트업 생태계는 인적자본, 기술혁신, 벤처캐피털 등의 요소들이 상호작용하며 시너지 효과를 내고 있는 것이 특징이라고 할 수 있다. 정책 면에서는 오바마 행정부 당시 ‘Startup America Initiative’, 「신생기업지원법(Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act)」 등을 통해 혁신기술 개발을 지원해왔으나, 트럼프 행정부 출범 이후 예산 감액, 고급 인력에 대한 비자 심사 강화 등으로 인해 지원정책의 동력을 상실하게 되었으며, 앞으로도 실리콘밸리 기업에 대한 규제가 강화될 것으로 전망하고 있다. 일본의 최근 스타트업 생태계의 특징은 CVC 투자 확대, 젊은 창업자 증가 등으로 요약할 수 있다. 일본의 대표적인 스타트업 지원정책으로 거대 벤처기업 육성을 위한 J-Startup 정책이 있으며, 최근에는 대기업과 대학 및 연구기관 간의 오픈 이노베이션을 활성화하기 위한 데이터 또는 가이드라인을 공개하는 등 환경 구축과 질적 향상에 주력하는 모습을 보이고 있다. 최근 들어 테크 스타트업을 중심으로 성장세를 보이고 있는 프랑스의 경우, 정부 지원책인 ‘La French Tech’ 와 민간 스타트업 캠퍼스인 ‘Station F’ 등을 통해 정부와 민간 부문이 유기적으로 상호작용하고 있다는 점이 특징이다. 특히 2019년에는 정책 시행 초기보다 스타트업 성장 인센티브와 홍보 지원을 강화하는 등 정책 다변화를 통해 프랑스의 스타트업 생태계 경쟁력을 보다 향상하고자 하였다. 제5장에서는 미국, 일본, 영국의 핀테크 관련 현황과 정책에 대해 서술하였다. 미국의 경우 대형 은행들이 핀테크 기업을 인수하거나 핀테크 기업과 협업하는 사례가 많다는 점, 대출 부문에서 핀테크가 차지하는 비중이 높아지고 있다는 점, 로보어드바이저 기술이 주목받고 있다는 점 등이 특징이다. 미국은 네거티브 규제 방식을 채택하고 있으며, 핀테크 사업 실행의 불확실성을 제거하기 위해 증권위원회를 포함한 금융당국이 합법성 여부를 판단하고 가이드라인을 제시해주고 있다. 일본은 관련 금융법(「은행법」, 「자금결제법」, 「금융상품거래법」 등)을 도입ㆍ개정하면서 새로운 핀테크 기업과 서비스의 등장을 장려하고 있다. 특히 일본은 선진적인 암호자산 관련 법제도를 구축하고 있다고 평가받는다. 주무부처인 금융청은 규제 관련 상담을 받을 수 있는 체계(핀테크 서포트 데스크, 핀테크 실증실험 허브)를 갖추고 있으며, 최근에는 기술 동향을 이해하고 핀테크 생태계 내 금융청의 입지를 다지고자 ‘교류’에 집중하고 있다. 특히 블록체인 기술과 관련해서는 국제 공동연구 및 라운드 테이블을 통해 해외유관기관으로 협력 대상을 넓혀가고 있는 것이 특징이라고 할 수 있다. 높은 금융산업 경쟁력을 보유한 영국은 규제 샌드박스를 통해 규제를 유예해주고 핀테크 친화적인 규제환경을 구축하는 등 적극적으로 핀테크를 지원하고 있다. 핀테크 클러스터인 Level39의 경우 공간 제공, 투자자 및 액셀러레이터와 네트워크 구축이 가능하며, 그중에서도 글로벌 인재들 간의 교류가 활발하다는 점이 가장 큰 특징이다. 이 밖에도 영국 내에서 성공한 핀테크 기업은 타 국가로 진출하는 것이 용이하다는 점을 통해 핀테크 생태계로서 영국의 위상을 확인할 수 있다. 제6장에서는 우리 정부의 혁신성장 패러다임과 스마트팩토리, 스타트업 생태계, 핀테크 관련 정책을 살펴보고 앞서 분석한 주요국의 혁신성장 현황 및 정책 사례와 비교ㆍ분석하여 다음과 같은 시사점을 도출하였다. 첫째, 우리 정부는 초연결 지능화 사회 구현을 목표로 5G 인프라 및 AI 분야에 대한 정부 R&D 투자를 확대하고, 부처 간 이기주의 및 칸막이 행정을 차단하는 범부처기관의 위상을 정립해야 한다. 또한 혁신성장 전략을 추진함에 있어서 산관학 연계를 활성화하고 혁신기술 테스트베드를 구축할 필요가 있다. 둘째, 스마트팩토리와 관련하여 명확하고 통일된 개념을 확립하고 산업용 IoT 플랫폼을 구축해야 한다. 아울러 중소기업의 스마트팩토리화를 위해 중소기업의 니즈에 맞는 맞춤형 지원이 요구된다. 셋째, 스타트업 정책 및 창업생태계와 관련해서는 포괄적 네거티브 규제 방식 적용을 검토하고 오픈 이노베이션을 확대하는 방안으로 정보 제공, 세제 확대 등을 고려할 수 있다. 또한 우리 정부도 프랑스 정부의 ‘French Tech National Team’과 같은 범정부 스타트업 통합지원팀이 필요하다. 넷째, 핀테크 환경 개선 측면에서 규제완화를 포함하여 스타트업 인프라 및 투자환경을 개선해나가야 한다. 또한 해외 성공 핀테크 사업모델을 분석하고 핀테크 기술 관련 부작용을 검토하는 노력도 필요하다. 한편 핀테크 활성화와 관리체계 구축을 위해서는 법제도를 검토하고 재정비해야 하며, 핀테크 기술에 대한 이해를 높이기 위해 국내외 네트워크 강화에도 주목해야 한다. 또한 정부당국의 금융규제 개선에 대한 혁신적인 접근이 필요하며, 해외진출 지원을 포함한 적극적이고 맞춤형 지원이 요구된다.English Abstract: The purpose of this study is to analyze innovation growth policies in the United States, Europe, and Japan, and to draw policy implications for Korea. Accordingly, the report analyzes the characteristics of innovation growth paradigms and three important sectors of the 4th Industrial Revolution (smart factories, start-up ecosystems, and fintech). Chapter 2 first analyzes the US government policies on advanced manufacturing, IoT, AI, and Big Data. In addition to support from the federal government, private companies and laboratories are cooperating actively through consortiums such as the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC), which operates several testbeds. The results of our analysis indicate that the link between government policies and private companies’ strategies is the core of US innovation growth. Second, the innovative growth paradigm in Germany has been changed from the “High-Tech Strategy” to the concept of “Industrie 4.0” and “AI Strategy.” The key to innovative growth in Germany is government-industry-academia cooperation realized through the introduction of use cases and the provision of testbeds. Third, the Japanese government is pursuing the vision of “Society 5.0” for the future of its society, a vision of a society that collects data through IoT technology and utilizes this big data through AI and robots. Japan is also implementing a policy called “Connected Industries” to secure competitiveness in the manufacturing industry by utilizing industrial data. Above all, the Japanese government has been putting efforts into improving the environment for big datautilization by modifying laws and supporting related projects. Chapter 3 describes the current status and policies related to smart factories in Germany and Japan. We explain the connection mechanisms and standards applied to smart factories in Germany such as the Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) and umati, or universal machine tool interface, and present the exemplary cases of Siemens, Bosch and SAP. Furthermore, the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) of Germany is utilizing Mittelstand 4.0 Competency Centers to support the digital transformation underlying smart factory projects in Germany. Japan is not yet at the stage of operating virtual factories, and is instead focusing on innovations in manufacturing processes. This innovation of manufacturing processes in Japan is characterized by digitalization, standardization, visualization, and automation, and industrial IoT platforms such as Mitsubishi Electric's Edgecross and Fanuc's FIELD systems have emerged for inter-factory and sectoral connectivity. Meanwhile, the Japanese government provides customized support by implementing public relations activities, dispatching experts, providing IoT tools, IoT taxation, and funding for IoT investment. In Chapter 4, we review current startup ecosystems and related policies in the United States, Japan and France. The startup ecosystem in the United States is characterized by synergistic effects of human capital, technological innovation, and venture capital. In terms of policy, the Obama administration supported the development of innovative technologies through the Startup America Initiative and the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. However, supporting policy has lost its momentum under the Trump administration, and regulations are expected to be tightened for companies in Silicon Valley. Recent features of the Japanese startup ecosystem can be summarized as the expansion of CVC investment and the increase of young entrepreneurs. Along with the J-Startup policy, the representative startup supporting policy in Japan to foster role model companies, the Japanese government is releasing data and guidelines to promote open innovation between large corporations, universities, research institutes and startups. In France, which is gaining recognition as a growing hub for tech startups, the government and theprivate sector are interacting actively through “La French Tech,” a government support plan, and Station F, a private startup campus. In 2019, the French government introduced a plan to enhance the competitiveness of the startup ecosystem by diversifying its policies, for instance by strengthening incentives and public relations support. Chapter 5 describes fintech trends and policies in the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom. The US government adopts a negative regulatory approach, and financial authorities examine legitimacy and provide guidelines to remove uncertainties in fintech services. Japan is encouraging the emergence of new fintech companies and services by introducing and amending relevant laws (the Banking Act, the Money Payment Act, and the Financial Instruments Transactions Act). The Financial Services Agency (FSA) is providing regulatory consultations through its Fintech Support Desk and Fintech Experimental Hub. Moreover, in terms of blockchain technology, Japan is strengthening its cooperation network by conducting joint research and round tables with overseas organizations. The UK, which is highly competitive in the financial industry, is actively supporting fintech by deferring regulations through a regulatory sandbox. The UK government is also establishing a fintech-friendly regulatory environment by hiring people with wide experience in the banking and fintech industries. Level 39, a fintech cluster, provides not only office space but also opportunities to network with investors and accelerators. In addition, the fact that successful fintech companies in the UK can easily enter overseas markets makes the UK more attractive for fintech companies. Following an analysis of the Korean government’s paradigm for innovative growth and policies related to smart factories, the startup ecosystem, and fintech, we compare these with major economies to draw the following policy implications. First, Korea should expand government R&D investment in 5G infrastructure and AI technology to build a hyper-connected intelligent society. It will also be critical to establish a whole-of-government agency to promote government-industry-academia cooperation and to provide test beds for innovative technologies. Second, we need to establish a clear and unified concept of smart factories and to build industrial IoT platforms. In addition, customized support that meets the needs of SMEs is required for SMEs to become smart factories. Third, with regard to the startup ecosystem, we could consider applying a comprehensive negative regulation system and promoting open innovation. Also, it is necessary to build an integrated support team for startups like the French Tech National Team in France. Fourth, deregulation should be carried out to foster the fintech industry in Korea. In addition, further efforts should be made to analyze successful overseas fintech business models and to review the adverse effects related to fintech. Meanwhile, it would be beneficial to review the legal system and pay more attention to strengthening domestic and international networks in order to revitalize fintech with a proper management system. Lastly, government authorities should adopt innovative approaches to improve financial regulation, as well as provide active and customized support including support for overseas expansion.

AB  - This chapter highlights the convergence of soft computing techniques with contemporary manufacturing and machining processes. The chapter has been divided into two subsegments, with the first one comprehensively discussing the machining processes and the integration of automation techniques in these processes. The importance and utility of computerized numerical control and part programming are interlinked with automation hardware and robotics. The extension of machining in Integrated Manufacturing Systems (IMS) with coordinated functioning of robotics and numerical control is also emphasized. The correlation of precision and Computer Integrated (Flexible) Manufacturing (CIM) cites key advantages of automation and computerized control over the conventional non-mechanized machining techniques or manual material removal operations. In the second subsegment, soft computing as a systems engineering approach has been discussed interlinking its aptness for the machining operations. The current soft computing methods including fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks (ANN), and genetic algorithms (GA) for the predictive modeling of machining operations has been elaborated in this chapter citing their utilization and significance in controlling, monitoring, and modeling these tasks. A comparison of soft computing approach for machining has also been associated with the finite element modeling (FEM) methods to outweigh the benefits of automated control and modeling in each operation, and their suitability for the specific machining tasks. The generic discussion is presented to the readers for selecting the suitable automation and modeling approach to augment certain machining tasks in the segment on computational optimization of themachining processes. The key soft computing modules are highlighted in a concluding synopsis as a mechanism for driving future process modernizations from the perspective of Industry 5.0 leveraging customer-centric digitization, advanced modeling technologies, cognitive computing, big-data management, robots, and smart machines tethered together for eco-friendly machining. The interconnected nature of the Industry 4.0-driven operations, combined with the rapid pace of digital transformation, poses a unique challenge in terms of cybersecurity, impacting businesses and their continuity and, thus, in citizens’ daily lives. The SecureIoT project introduced an open standards-based framework for IoT (Internet of Things) security, which enables IoT solution developers, integrators, and deployers to integrate and deploy secure IoT services that span multiple IoT platforms and involve networks of smart objects with embedded intelligence and semi-autonomous behavior. In addition to the implementation of the technical requirements, however, these primarily serve to provide work assistance to the people deployed in production, starting with safe and optimized processes of operators and machine setters, involving different levels within the production chain. Here, SecureIoT supports humans in adhering to the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of intime, in-quality, and in-cost maxims amidst the diversity of industrial complexity. This is exemplified by automated Machine-2-Machine (M2M) show-offs being controlled at new levels of trustworthiness, which are usually only applied to human-2-human communication. With this type of control, humans can provide a higher level of trust to the agile resource-driven automated decision-making processes for manufacturing and product security decisions. This way, SecureIoT contributes to the principles of human-centric industry and toward a secure and resilient society. Intelligent mobile robots are foreseen as one of the possible solutions to efficiently performing transportation and manipulation tasks in intelligent manufacturing systems (IMS) of Industry 4.0. In the last few decades, deep learning models have been recognized as a promising technique to enable the intelligent behavior of mobile robots for performing such tasks. For the particular problems of object detection and classification, a class of deep learning models, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), is the most widely used. This chapter presents an application of Region-based CNN (R-CNN) for advanced object identification tasks by using transfer learning. The proposed learning approach is further used for the improvement of Image- Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) algorithm used to control an intelligent mobile robot. The proposed algorithms are implemented in the MATLAB software package, and both simulation and the experimental verification of the proposed concept are performed on intelligent mobile robot, DOMINO (Deep learning Omnidirectional Mobile robot with INtelligent cOntrol). Four different CNN models are trained for object detection and classification, and the most suitable CNN model is ResNet-18, with the best recorded mean Average Precision (mAP) of 77%. Achieved experimental results show the applicability of CNN for accurate detection and classification of different manufacturing entities and the IBVS algorithm for efficient mobile robot control within IMS. The digital twin is a digital replica of physical data, processes, systems, and a digital simulation of reality, which can be used for various purposes. The concept of the digital twin provides an efficient way to cyber-physically integrate production, and optimize business processes and operational production procedures, thus achieving a new higher level of productivity. Digital twins can use data from sensors installed on physical objects to represent their status in real time, operating condition, or position. Two examples of digital twin development are presented, the first is based on static setting of a model and the second is based on dynamic setting. One of the essential criteria for smart factories, specifically for open computer numerical control (CNC) machine tool, is to bridge the gap between the physical machine tool and upper-level software applications. The difficulties are due to lack of an efficient and sufficient monitoring system. The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) and information technology overcame those issues and enabled the implementation of the industry 4.0 concept. This chapter presents a methodology and a case study on a novel implementation of an open CNC PC (personal computer)-based and service-oriented architecture-based monitoring system for Standard for Exchange of Product compliant Numerical Control (STEP-NC). The service-oriented architecture was implemented to efficiently use and manage information. The architecture is composed of four main layers: perception, communication, application, and CNC machine layer. In the perception layer, the CNC machine tool’s information is sensed via wearable devices, including two temperature sensors (infrared and thermocouple), one vibration sensor, and one electric current sensor. Then, the information is output to Node-MCU (ESP 8266) as a wireless Wi-Fi module. Under the communication layer, message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) network protocol is used to enable data transfer from device to device. The information from Node- MCU is sent wirelessly to the MQTT server through a device called Raspberry-Pi. After that, the information from the MQTT server is sent to the Application layer, which includes Node-RED and ThingSpeak. Finally, the information from the application layer is sent to the CNC machine to enable feedback in real-time, based on the machining process condition information. The completed system is then tested through two cased studies for system feasibility. The first case study is based on STEP-NC EXAMPLE 1 of Part 21 consisting features of one hole and one pocket, while case study two is based on modified STEP-NC EXAMPLE 1 of Part 21 consisting features of four holes and two pockets. Through the case study, the developed system successfully enabled data flow from CNC machine tool to upperlevel software and back to the CNC machine through an open CNC PC-based and service-oriented architecture-based monitoring system for STEP-NC. In the future, this novel development could be applied to other open CNC machine-based plug and play. Industry 4.0 has increased the potential for intelligent, broad-based, fully adaptable, autonomous, and fully accessible vision system research and industrial inspections based on the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, with technical advancements and successes. One of the key objectives of using the 3SMVI system is to significantly improve the quality of the product in the smart industries. This system precisely bridges the gap between machine vision and object dimension measurements. This chapter proposes the development of subsystems of an automated smart system based on STEP-NC for machine vision inspection - 3SMVI to detect and measure the surface feature of EXAMPLE 1 Part 21 of the ISO14649 standards. The objective of this chapter is to examine the concept of 3SMVI in the milling machine based on the camera system and lighting system to ensure the quality of the product. It discusses the complete procedure for designing a 3SMVI system to inspect the dimensions of the case study of the Delrin workpiece in real time. The pending step is to accept the requirements and conditions for the inspection. Thus, some of these criteria relate to inspecting the case study and others imposed on the industry. The appropriate selection of each essential aspect of the 3SMVI system has been presented. The Open CV library- developed system platform becomes a kind of cloud communication between the Raspberry Pi 4 board and the USB microprocessor on the principle of camera range. The cameras, lenses, lighting system, and processing platform are the significant characteristics. Finally, this chapter describes the hardware part of the 3SMVI system. More precisely, the imaging systems design and installation configuration were very compact and complete in terms of integration into a single-camera setup mounted at the top of the spindle. The empirical results shown in this chapter demonstrate that the proposed innovative calibrating technique can produce a very accurate model of the structured light sensor system. Global development requires the use of contemporary soft computing in production processes. The introduction of intelligent production processes requires the consideration of more advanced aspects in modern production technologies. In response to market demands, it is necessary to introduce advanced cutting processes that are consistent with the concept of sustainable development, and supported by modern data processing and control technologies. In this chapter, the concept of smart machining in advanced cutting processes and their soft computing-based modeling are described. A machinability evaluation framework of based on the analysis and parameterization of the advanced machining process by the selection of influencing factors and process performance indicators is shown. This activity is referred to as the necessary phase that creates the background for soft computing. The fundamentals of various soft computing techniques used in data analysis, modeling, simulation, and optimization of advanced cutting processes are presented. Minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) and High-pressure jet assisted machining (HPJAM) were analyzed as advanced machining processes. Process analysis was performed using the bio-inspired algorithm soft computing, and conclusions were drawn about the machinability, efficiency, and economy of the machining process. Natural-fiber-reinforced polymer composites are utilized in various fields, such as military, construction, packing, and sports due to their remarkable characteristics. Machining of reinforced polymer composites by using conventional machining process is too difficult and not economical and, therefore, unconventional machining plays a vital role. This chapter presents the modeling and optimization of the Abrasive water jet machining (AWJM) process on the processing of bananafiber- reinforced polymer composites (BFRPC) by using the Taguchi - JAYA method. Firstly, BFRP composites are fabricated with 5% weight by using the hand layup process. Secondly, the experimental analysis is done based on Taguchi method (L27 orthogonal array) and JAYA optimization technique to analyze the impact of processing variables, such as working pressure (WP), stand of distance (SoD), and nozzle speed (NS) on two response variables: material removal rate (MRR) and surface roughness (SR). Thirdly, parametric analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and regression analysis are carried out for fitness and statistical implications of the AWJM process using BFRP composites. The investigation results showed that the AWJM process is the most efficient technique for machining BFRC composites. JAYA algorithm is applied to determine the optimal conditions of the AWJM process. Desirability function approach (DFA) is applied to determine the overall desirability value, considering both responses (MRR and SR) that could help to evaluate the optimal conditions. JAYA algorithm determined an exceptionally high desirability value, equal to 0.9952 (close to one), for the population size and maximum number of iterations set at 60 and 40, respectively. JAYA algorithm determined optimized conditions that resulted in the following percent deviations in prediction with respect to practical experimental results: 3.2% for MRR and 7.8% for SR.
