AB  - With the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, vaccination is an urgent need worldwide. Internet of Things (IoT) has a vital role in the smart city for vaccine manufacturing with wearable sensors. According to the advanced services in intelligent manufacturing, the fourth resolution is also changing in Industry 5.0 and utilizes high-definition connectivity sensors. Traditional manufacturing companies rely on trusted third parties, which may act as a single point of failure. Access control, big data, and scalability are also challenging issues in existing systems because of the demand response data (DRD) in advanced manufacturing. To mitigate these challenges, CoVAC: A P2P Smart Contract-based Intelligent Smart City Architecture for Vaccine Manufacturing is proposed with three layers, including connection, conversion, and intelligent cloud layer. Smart contract-based blockchain is utilized at the conversion layer for resolving access control, security, and privacy issues. Deep learning is adopted in the intelligent cloud layer for big data analysis and increasing production for vaccine manufacturing in smart city environments. A case study is carried out wherein access data are collected from the various smart plants for vaccines using smart manufacturing to validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. Simulation of the proposed architecture is performed on the collected advanced sensor IoT plants data to address the challenges above, offering scalable production in the vaccine manufacturing for the smart city.

AB  - We are still in the midst of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), with more manufacturing lines being labeled as smart thanks to the integration of advanced ICT in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). While I4.0 aims to provision cognitive CPS systems, the nascent Industry 5.0 (I5.0) era goes a step beyond, aiming to build cross-border, sustainable, and circular value chains benefiting society as a whole. An enabler of this vision is the integration of data and AI in the industrial decision-making process, which does not exhibit yet a coordination between the Operation and Information Technology domains (OT/IT). This work proposes an architectural approach and an accompanying software prototype addressing the OT/IT convergence problem. The approach is based on a two-layered middleware solution, where each layer aims to better serve the specific differentiated requirements of the OT and IT layers. The proposal is validated in a real testbed, employing actual machine data, showing the capacity of the components to gracefully scale and serve increasing data volumes.

AB  - The use of advanced technologies has increased drastically to maintain any sensitive records related to education, health, or finance. It helps to protect the data from unauthorized access by attackers. However, all the existing advanced technologies face some issues because of their uncertainties. These technologies have some lapses to provide privacy, attack-free, transparency, reliability, and flexibility. These characteristics are essential while managing any sensitive data like educational certificates or medical certificates. Hence, we designed an Industry 5.0 based blockchain application to manage medical certificates using Remix Ethereum blockchain in this paper. This application also employs a distributed application (DApp) that uses a test RPC-based Ethereum blockchain and user expert system as a knowledge agent. The main strength of this work is the maintenance of existing certificates over a blockchain with the creation of new certificates that use logistic Map encryption cipher on existing medical certificates while uploading into the blockchain. This application helps to quickly analyze the birth, death, and sick rate as per certain features like location and year.

AB  - Technological competitiveness and emerging technologies are more necessary in the organizational strategy to cope with industrial advances and improve the nation's economy. In this sense, technological innovation, computational developments, smart devices, and other technologies are shaping the new industrial revolutions. Therefore, the technological competitiveness and emerging technologies of industry 4.0 and industry 5.0 are holistically analyzed to identify the key elements of developed economies and emerging economies. For this, we used a bibliometric analysis with Biblioshiny, a systematic review of the literature and a content analysis. The results in terms of technological competitiveness in developed economies show the importance of the competences and engineering skills in the personnel approach; R+D+i and the supply chain in the organizational approach; and the use of emerging technologies such as the internet of things and big data. The comparison with emerging economies indicates the importance of key elements such as training and education, and skills in the personnel approach; sustainability and structure in the organizational approach; and emerging technologies such as the internet of things and digitalization.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) can help to pave the way to the circular economy and to a more sustainable world by enabling the digitalization of many operations and processes, such as water distribution, preventive maintenance, or smart manufacturing. Paradoxically, IoT technologies and paradigms such as edge computing, although they have a huge potential for the digital transition towards sustainability, they are not yet contributing to the sustainable development of the IoT sector itself. In fact, such a sector has a significant carbon footprint due to the use of scarce raw materials and its energy consumption in manufacturing, operating, and recycling processes. To tackle these issues, the Green IoT (G-IoT) paradigm has emerged as a research area to reduce such carbon footprint; however, its sustainable vision collides directly with the advent of Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI), which imposes the consumption of additional energy. This article deals with this problem by exploring the different aspects that impact the design and development of Edge-AI G-IoT systems. Moreover, it presents a practical Industry 5.0 use case that illustrates the different concepts analyzed throughout the article. Specifically, the proposed scenario consists in an Industry 5.0 smart workshop that looks for improving operator safety and operation tracking. Such an application case makes use of a mist computing architecture composed of AI-enabled IoT nodes. After describing the application case, it is evaluated its energy consumption and it is analyzed the impact on the carbon footprint that it may have on different countries. Overall, this article provides guidelines that will help future developers to face the challenges that will arise when creating the next generation of Edge-AI G-IoT systems.

AB  - This study contributes to identifying a valid and reliable set of barriers to sustainable solid waste management framework rooted in society 5.0 perspectives in Taiwan. The SSWM-related causal interrelationships within the proposed hierarchical structure, and critical barriers for the practical improvement and enhancement of SSWM performance are identified as preference enriching both literature and practices. In nature, the hierarchical structure is with the causal interrelationships under uncertainties. The perspective empowers the creation of a new biosphere based on technological progress, but in the sustainable solid waste management field, it is difficult to encounter and shape the systematized processes due to barriers and challenges. To address this shortcoming, this study evaluates the technical challenges faced in the field of sustainable solid waste management toward society 5.0. The valid attributes are usually described the qualitative information. The fuzzy Delphi method is applied to acquire the valid and reliable attributes. Fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory experiment is to visualize the causal interrelationships among the attributes. Choquet integral with respect to the nonadditive attributes over the valid set provides an overall perspective function. The results establish an understanding of sustainable solid waste management barriers in the perspectives under uncertainties. Community uncertainty, policy and regulation problems, city architecture, and technology interaction are the factors that influence sustainable performance. In practices, (1) diverse disciplines and sectors in local, national, and global communities; (2) a lack of mobility and reliability; (3) mass production and mass consumption; (4) an insufficient level of artificial intelligence application; and (5) failures related to data management and security hinder the improvement of sustainable solid waste management toward society 5.0. The social and technical perspectives are indicated as the top priorities to improve SSWM performance.

AB  - Are new technologies in the medicine sector a driver to support the development of a society 5.0? Innovation pushes the artisan to become smart and lean, customer-oriented but within a standardized environment of production, maintaining and ensuring the quality of the product. An artisan is a user and innovator, as an essential part of the industrial chain. In the healthcare sector, the doctor is the industrial artisan, and medicine can be considered as an example of a smart tool, strongly tailored, that embeds the innovation of materials, nano-devices, and smart technology (e.g., sensors and controllers). But how much of society is ready to host smart technology "on board", becoming "on life", constantly connected with remote controls that allow us to monitor, gather data, and, in any case, act, with preventive healthcare solutions? After a short overview of the medicine sector, a preliminary, tentative link between technological innovation and the healthcare sector allows us to adopt several outlooks on how to change research, always more transdisciplinary, combining science with social science in order to remain human-centered.

AB  - The coffee plant, with more than 40 billion shrubs, 9 million tons of grains produced, and 80% of its production accounted for by small-scale producers, has been severely damaged since the emergence of <i>Hemileia vastatrix</i> and <i>Hypothenemus hampei</i>. Despite technological support, these pests have caused 20% to 40% production losses, a 50% to 60% deficit in performance, and a cost of between USD 70 million and USD 220 million to the world economies, which forces us to rethink actions centered on people as the key elements to develop appropriate solutions. For this, the present study presents a technological proposal centered on small indigenous coffee producer requirements for introducing Industry 5.0 technologies, considering roadmapping, knowledge management, statistical analysis, and the social, productive, and digital contexts of five localities in Mexico. The results show a correlation between monitoring and control, soil analysis, the creation of organic fertilizers, accompaniment, and coffee experimentation, as the actions to be implemented, proposing the introduction of a mobile application; sensors, virtual platforms, dome-shaped greenhouses, and spectrophotometric technology as relevant technologies centered on indigenous coffee producers' requirements. This study is important for policymakers, academics, and producers who wish to develop strategies centered on people in Mexico and the world.

AB  - This paper presents the development of an open-source, low-sized, BGA microcontroller breakout board, that can be used for the development of wearable and cyber-physical prototypes. The board is based on the low power, 8-bit, ATtiny20-CCU Microchip AVR microcontroller. The ATtiny20-CCU can be programmed without bootloader, using the Atmel Tiny Programming Interface (TPI), instead of In-System Programming (ISP). The C code used to program the microcontroller can be written and compiled using the Microchip Studio freeware platform. The ATtiny20-CCU Ultra Fine-pitch Ball Grid Array (UFBGA) packaging technology allows the shrinkage of the conceived Electroless Nickel-Immersion Gold (ENIG) Printed Circuit Board (PCB) to a size of only 15<i>.</i>5 × 13 mm. Its low cost also makes it a viable option for developing many educational electronic projects, especially for Instrumentation and Assistive Technology. The contribution of this paper is mainly the hardware prototype design, the PCB manufacturing, building and test of a very low-sized open source <i>µ</i>-breakout PCB board, for wearable Instrumentation applications, towards the emergent Society/Industry 5.0.

AB  - Human Factor strategy and management have been affected by the incorporation of Key Enabling Technologies (KETs) of industry 4.0, whereby operator 4.0 has been configured to address the wide variety of cooperative activities and to support skills that operate in VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous) environments under the interaction with ubiquitous interfaces on real and virtual hybrid environments of cyber-physical systems. Current human Competences-Capacities that are supported by the technological enablers could result in a radically disempowered human factor. This means that in the processes of optimization and improvement of manufacturing systems from industry 4.0 to industry 5.0, it would be necessary to establish strategies for the empowerment of the human factor, which constitute symbiotic and co-evolutionary socio-technical systems through talent, sustainability, and innovation. This paper establishes a new framework for the design and development of occupational environments 5.0 for the inclusion of singularized operators 4.0, such as individuals with special capacities and talents. A case study for workers and their inclusion in employment is proposed. This model integrates intelligent and inclusive digital solutions in the current workspaces of organizations under digital transformation.

The IoT builds on (1) broadband wireless internet connectivity, (2) miniaturized sensors embedded in animate and inanimate objects ranging from the house cat to the milk carton in your smart fridge, and (3) AI and cobots making sense of Big Data collected by sensors. Industry 4.0 is a high-tech strategy for manufacturing automation that employs the IoT, thus creating the Smart Factory. Extreme automation until "everything is connected to everything else" poses, however, vulnerabilities that have been little considered to date. First, highly integrated systems are vulnerable to systemic risks such as total network collapse in the event of failure of one of its parts, for example, by hacking or Internet viruses that can fully invade integrated systems. Second, extreme connectivity creates new social and political power structures. If left unchecked, they might lead to authoritarian governance by one person in total control of network power, directly or through her/his connected surrogates. We propose Industry 5.0 that can democratize knowledge coproduction from Big Data, building on the new concept of symmetrical innovation. Industry 5.0 utilizes IoT, but differs from predecessor automation systems by having three-dimensional (3D) symmetry in innovation ecosystem design: (1) a built-in safe exit strategy in case of demise of hyperconnected entrenched digital knowledge networks. Importantly, such safe exists are orthogonal-in that they allow "digital detox" by employing pathways unrelated/unaffected by automated networks, for example, electronic patient records versus material/article trails on vital medical information; (2) equal emphasis on both acceleration and deceleration of innovation if diminishing returns become apparent; and (3) next generation social science and humanities (SSH) research for global governance of emerging technologies: "Post-ELSI Technology Evaluation Research" (PETER). Importantly, PETER considers the technology opportunity costs, ethics, ethics-of-ethics, framings (epistemology), independence, and reflexivity of SSH research in technology policymaking. Industry 5.0 is poised to harness extreme automation and Big Data with safety, innovative technology policy, and responsible implementation science, enabled by 3D symmetry in innovation ecosystem design.

AB  - As an important emerging field of science and technology, smart factories have received attention from academia, industry, and the government. Currently, although some scholars have examined the research trends in the field of smart factories, we have not found any research on the analysis of the knowledge output of relevant organizations among smart factories. An urgent problem is whether cooperation between organizations with different characteristics will affect the overall development of intelligent factories. This study aimed to perform a comprehensive analysis of the knowledge content and structure of a smart factory and the characteristics of its knowledge production structure. We also evaluated whether the triple helix structure was stable, and whether the research topics of different issues were similar. The triple helix model was used to study three aspects of the knowledge structure of a smart factory: university, government, and industry. Furthermore, the research contents of different organizations were analyzed in detail using network analysis. It was found that research funding at the national level leads to a knowledge spillover effect. After 2015, a triple helix knowledge structure was formed in the field of smart factories, which maintained a certain stability until 2020. The output of triple helix cooperation research has a significant impact. University research focuses more extensively and intensively on technology, government research on macro aspects, and Industry 5.0 has become a hotspot in industry research. The government needs to provide new platforms to integrate and promote the development of smart factories.

AB  - Technology is composed of the words “Techne” and “Logos” that refer to the artistic/creative and the logical/scientific aspects of its dualism. And so inherent this Promethean concept lie the concepts of the Schumpeterian creative destruction and also the promise and potential for humanity’s better tomorrows. We live in an era of artificial intelligence–driven as well as viral disruptions that challenge the mind as well as the body. At the same time, the impact of our pursuit of prosperity at any cost on the environment triggers displaced people floods and viral pandemics undermining the standard of living and more importantly the foundations of trust in institutions and in a better tomorrow feeding populist movements and autocratic trends in democracies as well as emboldening dictators. This work discusses the concepts of Risk Management 5.0, Industry 4.0, Industry 5.0, Society 5.0, Digital Transformation, Blockchain, and the role of AI via the Internet of Things architectures that could enable “smarter as well as more humane solutions to our challenges.”

AB  - Climate change, the growth in world population, high levels of food waste and food loss, and the risk of new disease or pandemic outbreaks are examples of the many challenges that threaten future food sustainability and the security of the planet and urgently need to be addressed. The fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0, has been gaining momentum since 2015, being a significant driver for sustainable development and a successful catalyst to tackle critical global challenges. This review paper summarizes the most relevant food Industry 4.0 technologies including, among others, digital technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, big data analytics, Internet of Things, and blockchain) and other technological advances (e.g., smart sensors, robotics, digital twins, and cyber-physical systems). Moreover, insights into the new food trends (such as 3D printed foods) that have emerged as a result of the Industry 4.0 technological revolution will also be discussed in Part II of this work. The Industry 4.0 technologies have significantly modified the food industry and led to substantial consequences for the environment, economics, and human health. Despite the importance of each of the technologies mentioned above, ground-breaking sustainable solutions could only emerge by combining many technologies simultaneously. The Food Industry 4.0 era has been characterized by new challenges, opportunities, and trends that have reshaped current strategies and prospects for food production and consumption patterns, paving the way for the move toward Industry 5.0.

AB  - Abstract
It is widely accepted that the advent of robotics and automation in previous industrial revolutions brought about paradigm shifts in the manufacturing industry worldwide. It is therefore conceivable that the fifth industrial revolution will bring about a similar shift in norms and make fundamental changes in our approach to industry and manufacturing. From the first industrial revolution to the fourth, science and technological innovations, training and capital, were the key elements in evolving how products are conceived, designed and manufactured. Looking forward to the fifth industrial revolution it is likely that there will be a paradigm change in how industry will evolve given the tools of industry 4.0; the internet of things, digitization, blockchain, advanced materials, additive manufacture, artificial intelligence and robotics, drones, energy technology, biotechnology, neurotechnology and virtual and augmented reality.

AB  - The main purpose of this paper is to present what the Industry 5.0 phenomenon means in the supply chain context. A systematic literature review method was used to get evidence from the current knowledge linked to this theme. The results have evidenced a strong gap related to Industry 5.0 approaches for the supply chain field. Forty-one (41) publications, including conference and journal papers, have been found in the literature. Nineteen (19) words, which were grouped in four (4) clusters, have been identified in the data analysis. This was the basis to form the four (4) constructs of Industry 5.0: Industry Strategy, Innovation and Technologies, Society and Sustainability, and Transition Issues. Then, an alignment with the supply chain context was proposed, being the basis for the incipient Supply Chain 5.0 framework and its research agenda. Industry 5.0 is still in an embryonic and ideal stage. The literature is scarce and many other concepts and discoveries are going to emerge. Although this literature review is based on few available sources, it provides insightful and novel concepts related to Industry 5.0 in the supply chain context. Moreover, it presents a clear set of constructs and a structured research agenda to encourage researchers in deploying further conceptual and empirical works linked to the subject herein explored. Organizations’ leadership, policymakers, and other practitioners involved in supply chains, and mainly those currently working with Industry 4.0 initiatives, can benefit from this research by having clear guidance regarding the dimensions needed to structurally design and implement an Industry 5.0 strategy. This article adds valuable insights to researchers and practitioners, by approaching the newest and revolutionary concept of the Industry 5.0 phenomenon in the supply chain context, which is still an unexplored theme.

AB  - The world is heading in the wrong direction on carbon emissions where we are not on track to limit global warming to 1.5 °C; Ireland is among the countries where overall emissions have continued to rise. The development of wettable peatland products and services (termed 'Paludiculture') present significant opportunities for enabling a transition away from peat-harvesting (fossil fuels) to developing 'green' eco-innovations. However, this must be balanced with sustainable carbon sequestration and environmental protection. This complex transition from 'brown to green' must be met in real time by enabling digital technologies across the full value chain. This will potentially necessitate creation of new green-business models with the potential to support disruptive innovation. This timely paper describes digital transformation of paludiculture-based eco-innovation that will potentially lead to a paradigm shift towards using smart digital technologies to address efficiency of products and services along with future-proofing for climate change. Digital transform of paludiculture also aligns with the 'Industry 5.0 - a human-centric solution'. However, companies supporting peatland innovation may lack necessary standards, data-sharing or capabilities that can also affect viable business model propositions that can jeopardize economic, political and social sustainability. Digital solutions may reduce costs, increase productivity, improve produce develop, and achieve faster time to market for paludiculture. Digitisation also enables information systems to be open, interoperable, and user-friendly. This constitutes the first study to describe the digital transformation of paludiculture, both vertically and horizontally, in order to inform sustainability that includes process automation via AI, machine learning, IoT-Cloud informed sensors and robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and blockchain for cyber-physical systems. Thus, the aim of this paper is to describe the applicability of digital transformation to actualize the benefits and opportunities of paludiculture activities and enterprises in the Irish midlands with a global orientation.

AB  - In the era of Industry 4.0, manufacturing and production systems were revolutionized by increasing operational efficiency and developing and implementing new business models, services, and products. Concretely, the milestone set for Industry 4.0 was to improve the sustainability and efficiency of production systems. By extension, the emphasis was focused on both the digitization and the digitalization of systems, providing room for further improvement. However, the current technological evolution is more system/machine-oriented, rather than human-oriented. Thus, several countries have begun orchestrating initiatives towards the design and development of the human-centric aspect of technologies, systems, and services, which has been coined as Industry 5.0. The impact of Industry 5.0 will extend to societal transformation, which eventually leads to the generation of a new society, the Society 5.0. The developments will be focused on the social and human-centric aspect of the tools and technologies introduced under the framework of Industry 4.0. Therefore, sustainability and human well-being will be at the heart of what comes next, the Industry 5.0, as a subset of Society 5.0. Industry 5.0 will build on the foundations laid during Industry 4.0 by emphasizing human-centered, resilient, and sustainable design. Consequently, the authors in this research work, through a critical literature review, aim to provide adequate reasoning for considering Industry 5.0 as a framework for enabling the coexistence of industry and emerging societal trends and needs. The contribution of this research work extends to the provision of a framework to facilitate the transition from Industry 4.0 to Society 5.0.

AB  - Over the last decade, manufacturing processes have undergone significant change. Most factory activities have been transformed through a set of features built into a smart manufacturing framework. The tools brought to bear by the fourth industrial revolution are critical enablers of such change and progress. This review article describes the series of industrial revolutions and explores traditional manufacturing before presenting various enabling technologies. Insights are offered regarding traditional manufacturing lines where some enabling technologies have been included. The manufacturing supply chain is envisaged as enhancing the enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 through their integration. A systematic literature review is undertaken to evaluate each enabling technology and the manufacturing supply chain and to provide some theoretical synthesis. Similarly, obstacles are listed that must be overcome before a complete shift to smart manufacturing is possible. A brief discussion maps out how the fourth industrial revolution has led to novel manufacturing technologies. Likewise, a review of the fifth industrial revolution is given, and the justification for this development is presented.

AB  - Presently, artificial intelligence (AI) is playing a leading role in our contemporary world via numerous applications. Despite its many advantages, analytical frameworks highlighting the implications of AI applications are still evolving. Particularly, in manufacturing and industrial production where novel technologies are continuously being harnessed. Consequently, AI and the implications of its applications have relatively remained a grey area for many engineering managers who are key players in the gravitation of manufacturing and industrial production towards the fourth industrial revolution and more recently, the fifth industrial revolution, generally termed as Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and Industry 5.0 (I5.0), respectively. In this study, the implications of AI applications in the general context of manufacturing and industrial production, are presented to provide insight for engineering managers. These implications are discussed via PEST (political, economic, social, and technological) considerations of the broad implications of the adoption of AI techniques in manufacturing and industrial production systems. A new engineering management model has not been proposed in this paper. Rather, a discussion aimed at serving as a tool for the appraisal of the implications of the general applications of AI by engineering managers, who may not be AI specialists or data science experts is presented.

AB  - The fifth industrial revolution (Industry 5.0) integrates humans and machines to satisfy the increasing customization demands of the manufacturing complexity using an optimized robotized manufacturing process. Industry 5.0 make use of collaborative robots (cobots) for optimizing productivity and ensuring safety. At the same time, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are predicted to be the main part of industry 5.0 in the forthcoming days. Regardless of high mobility and energy-limited UAVs for wireless communication as significant advantages, different issues are also existing in the UAV networks, such as security, reliability, etc. Several research works have focused on resolving security issues in UAV communication to support safety-critical applications. With this motivation, this article presents an artificial intelligence-based UAV-borne secure communication with classification (AIUAV-SCC) framework for industry 5.0 environment. The proposed AIUAV-SCC model involves two major phases namely image steganography-based secure communication and deep learning (DL)-based classification. At the initial stage, a new image steganography technique with multilevel discrete wavelet transformation, quantum bacterial colony optimization based optimal pixel selection, and encryption processes take place. Next, in the second stage, the Bayesian optimization (BO)-based SqueezeNet model is applied for the classification of securely received UAV images where the parameters in the SqueezeNet method are optimally tuned by the utilize of the BO technique. To validate the performance of the presented model, extensive simulations are applied using the UC Merced dataset (UCM) aerial dataset and the outcomes are investigated under several dimensions. The outcomes make sure the goodness of the presented model on test UCM aerial dataset over the compared methods.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the variation in intrapleural pressure (IPP) with and without air leakage using a digital chest drainage system (DCS) for each pressure setting.
METHODS: In this retrospective single-centre study, we analysed 49,553 h of air leakage after anatomical lung resection in 714 patients between 2018 and 2020. The transition of mean IPP and mean air leak flow was monitored using DCS, and the association between mean IPP and mean air leak flow was examined. The relationship between the transition of mean IPP and air leakage according to the varying suction pressures on DCS was also investigated.
RESULTS: Overall, 272 patients (38.1%) showed air leakage after surgery. The mean IPP in patients without air leakage was -12.0 ± 2.9 cmH2O and maintained at about -12 cmH2O constantly, while the mean IPP in patients with air leakage was -8.3 ± 1.9 cmH2O, which changed to -12 cmH2O instantly if air leakage disappeared (P < 0.001). Among patients with air leakage, the mean IPP changed more distinctly in patients with mild suction management than in those with conventional suction management (-5.0 ± 2.6 to -11.5 ± 4.2 and -8.8 ± 1.3 to -12.1 ± 2.5 cmH2O, respectively; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The change in IPP on a DCS is useful for detecting air leakage. Furthermore, management with a mild suction setting on DCS makes it easy to recognize the disappearance of postoperative air leakage.

AB  - Resilient manufacturing is a vision in the Industry 5.0 blueprint for satisfying sustainable development goals under pandemics or the rising individualized product needs. A resilient manufacturing strategy based on the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks plays an essential role in facilitating production and supply chain recovery. IIoT contains confidential data and private information, and many security issues arise through vulnerabilities in the infrastructure. The traditional centralized IIoT framework is not only of high cost for system configuration but also vulnerable to cyber-attacks and single-point failure, which is not suitable for achieving the resilient manufacturing vision in Industry 5.0. Recently, researchers are seeking a secure solution of middleware based on blockchain technology integration for decentralized IIoT, which can effectively protect the consistency, integrity, and availability of IIoT data by utilizing the auditing and tamper-proof features of the blockchain. This paper presented a review of secure blockchain middleware for decentralized IIoT towards Industry 5.0. Firstly, the security issues of conventional IIoT solutions and the advantages of blockchain middleware are analyzed. Secondly, an architecture of secure blockchain middleware for decentralized IIoT is proposed. Finally, enabling technologies, challenges, and future directions are reviewed. The innovation of this paper is to study and discuss the distributed blockchain middleware, investigating its ability to eliminate the risk of a single point of failure via a distributed feature in the context of resilient manufacturing in Industry 5.0 and to solve the security issues from traditional centralized IIoT. Also, the four-layer architecture of blockchain middleware presented based on the IIoT application framework is a novel aspect of this review. It is expected that the paper lays a solid foundation for making IIoT blockchain middleware a new venue for Industry 5.0 research.

AB  - Recent integrity issues related to halal product is alarming. While the literature has introduced Industry 4.0 technologies, the reality in the food industry especially halal related product shows disparity in the contribution of scholars to real-world issue. The disparity between both literature and industry is due to information integration. The issue related to information integration can be solved through Society 5.0 where human and technology are connected through information management, monitoring, and control. Nevertheless, studies related to Society 5.0 are limited and isolated to social and technology area since the concept is still new in the literature. However, the advantages of integrating Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0 are able in ensuring integrity in food supply chain especially related to halal. Thus, the objective of this paper is to propose a model based on Society 5.0 to provide solution to food integrity in the supply chain. This study has undertaken extensive literature review related to Society 5.0 and integrity practices. The outcome of the paper proposed a model that links Society 5.0 and Industry 4.0 technologies to help organisation manage halal food in the supply chain with integrity as its measurements. The model proposed in this study is useful for any organisation to adopt halal supply chain and understand how to implement Industry 4.0 as well as managing information through Society 5.0.

AB  - Industry 4.0 have witnessed a paradigm shift from cyber-physical systems (CPS) that aims at massive automation, to a more customer-driven approach. The shift has been attributed to the design of hyper-cognitive systems, integration of virtual and extended reality, digital machinery prototyping and twin designs, trusted machine boundaries, collaborative robots, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based supply chains. This new wave, termed Industry 5.0, is expected to leverage massive production with user-centric customization outside the scope of Industry 4.0 ecosystems. Industry 5.0 is expected to assist diverse industrial verticals like healthcare, smart farming, drones, smart grids, and supply chain production ecosystems. However, data is shared among multiple heterogeneous networks, spanning different authoritative domains. Thus, trusted and secured data transfer is crucial to synergize and secure the industrial perimeters. Blockchain (BC) is a preferred choice as a security enabler to Industry 5.0 ecosystems owing to its inherent property of immutability, chronology, and auditability in industrial systems. Limited works are proposed that present the vision and holistic view of BC-assisted Industry 5.0 applications. The article presents a first-of-its-kind survey on BC as a security enabler in Industry 5.0. Based on a descriptive survey methodology and research questions, we presented the key drivers, and potential applications, and propose an architectural vision of BC-based Industry 5.0 in diverse applicative verticals. The survey intends to present solutions that would assist industry practitioners, academicians, and researchers to drive novel BC-assisted solutions in Industry 5.0 verticals.

AB  -  According to many, we are at the brink of the fourth industrial revolution. The theme of Industry 4.0 is "Smart Manufacturing for the Future". Now, some futurists even discuss what the fifth industrial revolution’s theme will be. There are a few visions for Industry 5.0. One emerging theme is human-robot co-working. In recent years, we have seen significant advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) research. Today, there are robots for various purposes at affordable prices in the market. It is not long before we closely interact with robots in our lives and workplaces. Testing autonomous cars in traffic is a promising example of this upcoming trend. There are companies having an employee record for robots or AI applications. While there are many studies on human-robot collaboration for low-level tasks with a focus on robot development, we lack studies focusing on organizational issues emerging from human-robot co-working. In this study, we discuss the possible issues related to human-robot co-working from the organizational and human employee’s perspective. We believe the issues identified in this study will be the focus of many upcoming organizational robotics research studies.

AB  - Abstract Managing a sustainable supply chain is a concept related to many areas of the economy. Its efficient functioning depends on the implementation of SDG activities and the development of industry (first-fourth/fifth industrial revolution). Due to the likelihood of different priorities in the implementation of the sustainable development goals, it is important to build such relationships, e.g. in the supply chain, so that their implementation could take place under similar conditions. Digitization, or the circular economy concept (CE), create an opportunity for the SME sector to build relationships as part of industry networks, for instance, where the managed supply chain would have a common and realistic goal to achieve. This goal will be a priority in business models based on sustainable development. The article presents the results of research regarding the furniture industry in Poland (key industry, referred to as smart specialization). The results of the analysis show that the industry has a large production potential, and the natural resources used in it are constantly increasing. However, there are doubts raised by the lack of stability in the dynamics of the sold production in the industry. Ultimately, the business model of the industry supply chain should focus on the environmental aspect (sustainable management of the raw material supply chain) and on eco-friendly consumption (sustainable management of the product supply chain), so that it can be managed in a sustainable way.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) has been gradually valued due to its high prevalence, high risk, and high mortality. This article is to find an alternative to the polysomnography (PSG) OSAHS diagnosis method and assesses the subject's degree of illness considering the supply chain and Industry 5.0 requirement, efficiently, accurately and easily. The blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) signal is used to count the number of apnea or hypoventilation events. It extracts 35-dimensional features based on the time domain to enhance the process resilience, including approximate entropy, Centralized Trend Measurement (CTM), and LZ complexity for the diagnosis process in supply chains. This article summarizes the Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) characteristics. The feature selection process is reduced from 35 to 7 dimensions and benefits the implementation in the practical supply chains in industry 5.0. A 92% accuracy rate is reached in assessing the prevalence of OSAHS, satisfying the industrial deployment.

AB  - Emergence of industry 5.0 facilitates real-time synchronisation of production processes, which helps with the production of customized products. Although industry 5.0 can revolutionize the landscape of goods production, still its adoption is in the infancy stage. Hence, the purpose of this article is to examine barriers that impede the adoption of industry 5.0, and to propose solution initiatives (SIs). After an in-depth literature review and interviews with German industry experts in pharmaceutical sector, barriers and SIs are ranked using an integrated Analytical hierarchy process-elimination and choice expressing reality-decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (AHP-ELECTRE-DEMATEL) approach. “Linking virtual reality and reality” is found to be the most critical deterrent to the adoption of industry 5.0, and falls into a causal group, which signifies their influence on other deterrents. “Measures for better connectivity with patients” is of utmost importance for German firms to ensure secure communication and safeguard patient data. The findings also highlight the problems with the adoption of high-tech innovations due to lack of standardization and fair benchmarking policies on industry 5.0. This article concludes by proposing an industry 5.0 framework. The inhibitors to adopting industry 5.0 were investigated in this article, the results of which will assist practitioners and decision makers to understand the issues with industry 5.0. The results of this article will help potential adopters of this technology to look for the SIs. This will therefore pave the path for effective adoption of industry 5.0 across the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector.

AB  - Due to the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), logistics and supply chain operations have been digitally transformed. Physical objects are interconnected to perform real-time monitoring and decision support through cyber-physical systems. Besides machine-to-machine communications, humans play an essential role in IoT-empowered supply chain operations to monitor and configure IoT devices and interact with IoT systems for enhanced industrial intelligence. Extended reality (XR) technologies are exploited for immersive visualisation to strengthen the connectivity between human and cyber-physical systems. However, the role and development of XR in the IoT-empowered supply chain scenarios are not revealed. Therefore, this article attempts to introduce readers to the latest XR technologies and summarise significant research opportunities/challenges raised by the current literature to facilitate further interest in this topic. The systematic literature review process analysed 71 research articles from 1,207 relevant publications using text mining models, including the bag of words (BoW) and LexRank algorithms. Consequently, the article synthesises emerging XR solutions for human-cyber-physical interaction to guide the next-generation XR research for logistics and supply chain management. At the same time, human-centricity can be emphasised in future research agendas for Industry 5.0.

AB  - For almost a decade now, production science has been dealing with Industry 4.0. In recent years, a large number of technological innovations have been developed and introduced into practice, enabling the implementation of smart and connected manufacturing systems. Over the next years, researchers and practitioners will face new challenges in Industry 4.0 to achieve the original vision of an intelligent and self-optimizing factory. We are currently at a crossroads between the first level of Industry 4.0, which was characterized by technologically driven innovations, and a future level of Industry 4.0+, which will be based on data-driven innovation. This article introduces these two phases of Industry 4.0 and gives a direction of research trends with growing attention in manufacturing science and practice. In the context of Industry 4.0+, two research directions, in particular, are expected to generate groundbreaking changes in production and its environment. This is, on the one hand, the introduction of Artificial Intelligence into manufacturing and on the other hand the use of nature as inspiration in the form of Biological Transformation.

AB  - Physical Internet (PI) is an open global logistics system of which components are hyperconnected for increased efficiency and sustainability. Digital twin (DT), referring to the virtual representation of a physical object, is well-perceived as a key driver in the development of PI-based Supply Chain Management (SCM). Due to the capabilities of real-time monitoring and evaluation of large-scale complex systems, significant research efforts have been made to exploit values of PI/DT in SCM. Despite this, the current literature remained largely unstructured and scattered due to a lack of systematic literature reviews to synergise research findings, analyse the evolution of research fronts and extract emerging trends in the field. To address this issue, the paper deploys a bibliometric knowledge mapping approach to provide a bird's eye view of the current research status in the PI/DT-SCM area. Using CiteSpace's keyword co-occurrence network, 518 journal articles are clustered into 10 key research streams on PI/DT applications in: job shop scheduling, smart manufacturing design, PI-based SCM, manufacturing virtualisation, information management, sustainability development, data analytics, manufacturing operations management, simulation and optimisation, and assembly process planning. Based on citation burst rate, keywords representing research frontiers of the PI/DT are detected and their temporal evolutions are discussed. Likewise, some identified emerging research trends are production process and system, robotics, computer architecture, and cost. Finally, seven future research directions are suggested, which emphasise on several PI/DT-related issues, including business ecosystem, sustainability development, SC downstream management, cognitive thinking in Industry 5.0, citizen twin in digital society, and SC resilience.

AB  - In the past, manufacturing equipment was instrumented hard-wired. Industrial equipment such as sensors, controllers, and others are expensive, and upgrading manufacturing equipment in existing facilities is costly. The growing use of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven cost reductions in sensors, controllers, and communications through high volumes of digital devices and value-added components. The manufacturing sector with its massive installed base of legacy equipment has also become an area of interest for the advances in innovative digital technologies. Meanwhile, the next level of innovation in manufacturing has been achieved, labeled by the term 4th Industrial Revolution, in short Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 takes the automation of manufacturing processes to a new level by introducing customized and intelligent production technologies. Machines are connected and communicate with each other to ultimately make decisions, operate independently, or cooperate with humans in a customer-oriented production environment. This raises the question about the key issues of the next industrial enhancement and the term to call it? The change from Industry 4.0 to the next innovative industrial enhancement is termed Industry 5.0. However, Industry 5.0 has its root in the concept of Industry 4.0. Thus, the key issues of the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 can be seen in the goal of making manufacturability sustainable from economic, ecologic and societal perspectives. This requires building a circular economy with a focus on a human centric industry. The paper describes the development from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0.

AB  - For an understanding of the concept of the Quadruple and Quintuple Helix Innovation Systems, it is essential to realize that the Quadruple and Quintuple Helices are based on democracy and ecology. This has two implications: (1) the further advancement and evolution of knowledge and innovation are requiring a co-evolution with democracy or knowledge democracy, and (2) ecology, ecological sensitivity, and environmental protection are a necessity for the survival of humanity, but they should also be regarded as drivers for further knowledge production and innovation development. This implies that for an innovation system to be a Quadruple and Quintuple Helix Innovation System, the government and the political system, addressing the innovation system, must be democratic in substance, and not only in form. This indicates how a Quadruple and Quintuple Helix differs from Triple Helix approaches to innovation. Furthermore, within the framework of Quadruple and Quintuple Helix, the “Democracy of Climate” for innovation and the “Democracy of Knowledge” are combined together in creating a nexus. Implications for strategy, policy, and practice are manifold, also incorporating aspects of Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0.

AB  - The Industry 4.0 trend speeds up the adoption of a variety of technologies. In modern manufacturing, system data are collected both from the field through sensors and by exploiting complex simulations. Data analysis techniques became crucial to build and maintain any efficient production line, while autonomous systems and robots are the main focus of researchers and practitioners. This pervasive use of artificial intelligence derived technologies pushed humans to the border of production systems. Industry 5.0 aims at bringing the attention back to humans in production lines while magnifying their interactions with intelligent systems. This new trend will impact the design of future manufacturing infrastructures, increasing their complexity. Engineers will need modeling and developing tools able to capture this complexity. In this paper, we analyze the modeling languages and tools being used, identifying their strengths and weaknesses. Then, we propose some possible directions to provide engineers with the expressive power needed to tackle the challenges posed by Industry 5.0.

AB  - The article addresses the main trends in the development of world industry within the framework of Industry 4.0 and the new Industry 5.0. The main prerequisites for the emergence of the Industry 5.0 concept are studied, in particular, extensive digitization and the dynamic development of technologies of the fourth industrial revolution, which has led to the certain dehumanization of industry and has increased the interest of the scientific community in the aspects of industrial humanization, human-centeredness of industry, stability, sustainability, and resilience. The main principles and trends of the development of Industry 5.0, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, geopolitical crises, and disruptions of the global value chains on the condition and prospects for the development of world industry, new rules and requirements for global product manufacturers, technological innovations, and production trends are studied. The author identifies directions for expanding the concept of Industry 4.0 to include humanization, sustainability, and resilience. The rapid development of new technologies often outpaces the ability of organizations to align their development priorities with it and effectively take advantage of new opportunities, which leads to the need to navigate the changing business environment in time and develop a relevant development strategy. With so many technological changes, changing workforce demands, and social and regulatory priorities, there is a need to define guiding principles to help set the course for the digital industry. Industry 5.0 has become the basis for revising the future of energy, manufacturing, and mobility of supply chains, which rest on the foundations laid by Industry 4.0. The weaknesses of the Industry 4.0 concept, especially in terms of the role of a human in "smart" production and ensuring sustainable development are outlined. Accordingly, the expediency of further research and implementation of the Industry 5.0 concept is substantiated. On the basis of the conducted research on the implementation of Industry 5.0 and the world trends of industrial development, the author justifies the feasibility of reorienting production and business activities to human-centeredness as a new norm, strengthening sustainability, in particular, careful planning of stabilization measures in case of disruption of the global value chains – from factory facilities to network supplier, to transport channels, to regulatory and geopolitical changes, ensuring sustainability with manufacturers rethinking their impact on natural resources in connection with the expansion of the regulatory and legislative framework and investors' attention to reducing carbon emissions and negative impact on the environment.

AB  - In March 2020 the world as we know it was shaken to the core by the Covid-19 global pandemic. This crisis has had a significant impact on the EU27 economy and triggered unprecedented policy responses across Europe and the globe. Collaborative Robotics, or Cobots, have made a significant difference to many manufacturing plants by facilitating social distancing between workers, introducing flexibility on the factory floor and allowing the plants to manufacture high quality items for use in the medical field. California-based DCL Logistics, a third-party logistics company, decided to employ Cobots to manage a 30% increase in orders in the immediate aftermath of the outbreak and the Cobots have led to a 300% increase in productivity and a 60% jump in labor cost savings [1]. This paper will look at these flexible robots and discuss the benefits they brought to manufacturing in a time of global crisis.

AB  - Globalization and mass customization are commonly translated into increased levels of complexity in manufacturing systems. One of the main reasons is the increased number of variables, parameters, and interrelations on the shop floor. This intrinsic complexity can grow exponentially when considering the manufacture of large-size products with high levels of variability and variants: the mass production of large recreational motorboats with high levels of customization and low production volumes, mass customization. With the increasing role of sustainability and concepts of Industry 5.0, focusing not just on improving production systems but also human wellbeing, quick decision making becomes essential. Data and digitalization are becoming the cornerstone for system improvement, and digital data availability and analysis can facilitate the utilization of computerized tools to support decision making and maximize the performance of complex systems. For that purpose, simulation can be a powerful analytical tool to design, maintain, and improve complex manufacturing systems. Simulation techniques usually allow handling the size and complexity commonly associated with manufacturing systems. However, in systems with highly customized and large-size products, manual processes, and limited floor space, the implementation of simulation techniques is not straightforward, especially considering the aspects of variability, data collection, model validation, and system reconfiguration. With a particular focus on large-size products and limitations of a constrained existing facility layout, this paper presents the implementation of a simulation-based reconfiguration assessment considering manual production, assembly, and internal logistics requirements. Going through an industrial case study of large recreational motorboats manufacturing, the paper analyses the system analysis, data collection, implementation, and validation of the methodology step by step. Considering different what-if scenarios, the focus is on the capacity reconfiguration using Discrete-Event Simulation. The results can serve as a guideline for decision-makers and stakeholders working with complex mass customization manufacturing systems and space-constrained facility layouts.

AB  - The industrial revolution has changed the socio-economic civilisation of mankind. It started dating back in the late 1700s and has been in continuous evolution since then. Presently, we are experiencing the latest industrial revolution, known as Industry 4.0. Among others, ubiquitous technologies probably have been the most influential in the implementation of Industry 4.0. This has led to a new manufacturing paradigm known as ubiquitous manufacturing. This chapter presents an in-depth discussion on different aspects of ubiquitous manufacturing. In addition to the history of industrial revolutions and the fundamentals of ubiquitous manufacturing, the topics such as production planning and scheduling, automated material handling system, and dynamic manufacturing are meticulously discussed from the perspective of the real-life scenarios, in the age of ubiquitous manufacturing. The ubiquitous technologies that have enabled ubiquitous manufacturing are reviewed in detail. Several other related and advanced manufacturing technologies such as cloud manufacturing, cloud robotics, global manufacturing, lean manufacturing, agile manufacturing, additive manufacturing, chaordic manufacturing, etc. are duly accentuated. A futuristic view on Industry 5.0 is also presented.

AB  - Background: Given the importance of human centricity, resilience, and sustainability, the emerging concept of Industry 5.0 has pushed forward the research frontier of the technology-focused Industry 4.0 to a smart and harmonious socio-economic transition driven by both humans and technologies, where the role of the human in the technological transformation is predominantly focused on. Several studies discuss the impacts of disruptive technologies on smart logistics operations in Industry 4.0. However, since Industry 5.0 is a new concept and still in its infancy, its implications for smart logistics have not been discussed. Methods: To fill this gap, this paper presents a comparative bibliometric analysis to show the connection and differences between Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0 and their implications for smart logistics. A thorough content analysis is then given to illustrate the features of smart logistics in Industry 5.0 concerning four areas, namely intelligent automation, intelligent devices, intelligent systems, and intelligent materials. Results: The results show that, compared with Industry 4.0, the research of smart logistics in Industry 5.0 puts more focus on the interaction between humans and technology in the digital transition, with the increasing adoption of collaborative technologies, e.g., human-machine systems, collaborative robots, and human-robot collaboration. Conclusions: Finally, a research agenda is proposed for identifying future research directions of smart logistics in Industry 5.0.

AB  - Industry 4.0 has brought about a revolution in how the manufacturing industry operates, from the product concept generation to the automated, high-tech factories that fabricate the products. Manufacturing systems are fully integrated, multi-robot and collaborative. The key elements of Industry 4.0 are information and communications technology (ICT), connectedness, sensor technology, robotics and innovative production systems. Smart manufacturing systems producing smart products. The result of this highly automated environment of Industry 4.0 is that the humans are at risk of no longer playing a valuable role. This paper asks the following questions: Can we ensure that humans have a place in the highly automated workplace of the future (Industry 5.0) by optimizing human capital? Can the traditional educational provider supply the skills required to educate this modern worker or do we require an innovative educational system?

To maintain production and adjust quickly to technological transformation, innovative work-based learning approaches are emphasized. Intelligent machines are becoming capable of interaction and collaboration with humans. They not only introduce a new type of learnable workforce to manufacturing but may open opportunities to enhance learning of all learners. Symbiotic relationships of humans and machines have wide potential for human-centric manufacturing (aka Industry 5.0). Moreover, connecting smart devices and deploying self-learning solutions is envisioned to increase flexibility of manufacturing, thus changing work division between humans and machines.

AB  - The new age economy is primarily driven by Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0, which facilitate smartification of organizations by helping them integrate and automate decision making. Recent advances in information and communication technologies, such as the cloud, big data, Internet of things, and artificial intelligence and nanotechnology, have accelerated the adoption of Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0. Because of these advancements, organizations are now facing new challenges in the form of cybersecurity risks that are partly caused by these technologies. In recent years, there has been a spike in the number of cyberattacks, and organizations are taking steps to minimize the impacts of these attacks. To address this critical issue, in this article, we discuss possible future research directions that production and operations management (POM) researchers can undertake to help organizations, supply chains, and governments develop robust strategies for reducing the number of attacks and their repercussions. In particular, we identify several avenues for future research in the following domains of POM: (1) global operations strategy, (2) healthcare operations management, (3) public policy, (4) management of technology, (5) supply chain management, and (6) disruptive technologies. Research on the topic of cybersecurity is not only an opportunity for operations management researchers but also critical for industry and society to overcome the challenges of cybersecurity risks.

AB  - Modern-day agriculture supply chains have evolved from sovereign and autonomous local stakeholders to a worldwide interconnected system of multiple participants linked by complicated interactions, impacting the production, processing, transportation, and delivery of food to end consumers. Regular instances of fraudulent acts reveal a lack of openness in agriculture supply chains, raising worries about financial losses, eroding customer trust, and lowering corporate brand value. To develop an efficient and reliable trading environment, several fundamental modifications in the present supply chain architecture are required. There is broad consensus that blockchain can improve transparency in agriculture-food supply chains (agri-food SCs). Consumers now demand safe, sustainable, and equitable food production processes, and businesses are using blockchains and the internet of things to meet these needs. For enhanced responsiveness in agri-food SCs, new concepts have evolved that combine blockchains with various Industry 5.0 technologies (e.g., blockchain technology, big data, internet of things (IoT), radio frequency identification (RFID), near field communication (NFC), etc.). It is critical to cut through the hype and examine the technology’s limits, which might stymie its acceptance, implementation, and scalability in agri-food supply chains. This study presents Agri-SCM-BIoT (Agriculture Supply Chain Management using Blockchain and Internet of things) architecture to address the storage and scalability optimization, interoperability, security and privacy issues security, and privacy of personal data along with storage concerns with present single-chain agriculture supply chain systems. We also discussed the classification of security threats with IoT infrastructure and possible available blockchain-based defense mechanisms. Finally, we discussed the features of the proposed supply chain architecture, followed by a conclusion and future work.

AB  - The industry transition towards digital transformation opens the possibilities to utilize data for enhancing sustainability in industrial operations and build capabilities towards resilient and circular operations, i.e., shift towards industry 5.0. This paper explores how data-driven decision-making (DDDM) can enable sustainable and resilient supply chain operations within the manufacturing industry. A series of in-depth interviews were conducted with experts, researchers, and company representatives across the manufacturing industry and universities in Sweden. The findings show a consensus among companies, researchers, and literature about the potential of data utilization for sustainability purposes; however, in most cases, the complete transformation towards data-driven has not happened yet. Companies have uncertainty about what data is needed rather than its lack. Reliability & validity of data become essential to exploit the potential of the data organizations already possess. Based on the literature and interview data, a conceptual model is proposed, including three identified parameters connected to DDDM, 1) data and IT infrastructure, 2) current operations, and 3) an improved triple bottom line performance. The model captures the interconnections between such parameters, depicting the benefits and challenges of DDDM and its relation to more sustainable and resilient supply chain operations within the manufacturing industry. In a data-driven approach, real-time analysis of complex & extensive amounts of data gives unlimited possibilities to improve manufacturing operations through decision-making.

AB  - In modern digital era, technology has dominated in all sectors of society. In manufacturing sectors, technology development has been divided into different time zones (Industry 1.0–4.0). These industrial upheavals have highly focused on technology applications. But modern challenges of customization, personalization and technology upgrading can only be done by human involvement. These modern challenges have led to new industrial revolution called “Industry 5.0,” which emphasizes on technology advancement with human empowerment. In this research paper, authors have studied the enablers, which help in execution of Industry 5.0 in Indian manufacturing sector. Eight enablers have been distinguished by literature review and specialist’s supposition. By using total interpretative structural modeling (TISM) technique, authors have studied the relationship between these enablers. Authors have developed a diagraph to show structural relationship between different enablers influencing implementation of Industry 5.0 in Indian manufacturing sector.

AB  - Internet of Things is becoming more prominent development domain globally. Developments in the Industrial IoT are necessary for consideration of future pandemic situations like COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 pandemic almost affected all domains throughout the world. Now it is necessary to think in a progressive manner and be ready to tackle such situations. One of the most affected sectors is the manufacturing sector, which failed to match the demand and supply chain due to frequent lockdowns. A development of recent Industry 5.0 is a result of a need for the industrial automation. Even though the challenge remains to lower the human–machine interfacing with the development of maximum IoT automation and we may call this as a building block of Industry 6.0 based on feedback from Industry 4.0. What if manufacturing industry is moulded like call centre support where workers can manage the production line by operating processes from anywhere? As an initial step, this paper presents the new middleware broker communication architecture design for MQTT and CoAP protocols, which can be a building block for Industry 6.0. This paper focuses on two key roles as the design of middleware broker communication architecture for MQTT and CoAP for industrial automation with consideration of common packet format parameters and development of deep learning algorithm “Multi-ProTest” for IIoT security analysis. This improves the overall system performance by reducing delay by 6.17% and jitter by 14.10%.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce cloud supply chain which is a business model based on cloud-enabled networking of some third-party physical and digital assets to design and manage a supply chain network. Cloud supply chain integrates concepts and technology of Industry 4.0 and digital platforms emerging in the “supply chain-as-a-service” paradigm. This paper conceptualizes the cloud supply chain as a new and distinct research area. Through analysis of practical cases, we deduce some generalized characteristics of the cloud supply chain. In the generalised model, we formalize supply chain multi-structural dynamics and dynamic service composition. Our results show that the main generalized characteristics of the cloud supply chain are related to (i) multi-structural dynamics; (ii) platforms, digital supply chains, ecosystems, and visibility, (iii) dynamic service composition with dynamically changing buyer/supplier roles, (iv) resilience and viability, and (v) intertwined supply networks and circular economy. We close by discussing future research directions including novel context of Industry 5.0.

AB  - With the introduction of Society 5.0 for the sustainable future, special caution is given to humans’ role within the general system. Similarly, Industry 5.0 as a concept has been presented, followed by Logistics 5.0 in its theoretical framework. The transition towards the new concept of Logistics 5.0 requires an accurate and optimal strategic plan definition for which, in this paper, an implementation model based on decision support systems will be developed. The output data from this model are the priority of Logistics 5.0 elements (from five groups—green warehousing, green transport, green packaging, infrastructure and organization, and human resources) for the optimal implementation, based on three goals (initial investment, return of investment time, implementation and exploitation complexity) that companies aim to achieve in the future. The model is based on the analytic hierarchy process, and data were collected from an expert group and analyzed with several statistical methods. The result is a model that provides an optimal strategy for the implementation of elements of Logistics 5.0. The implementation priority list of elements is very beneficial for the management of many companies from various types of industries.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has been implemented by multiple manufacturing companies into their production chain as this technology is the main source of digitalization in a production plant. It improves the data assembling, productivity of the operation, communication efficiency, and overall manufacturing performance. IoT is also serves to be a good means for improved and efficient warehouse automation. It makes the delivery of products more efficient by calculating the least routes and also reduces the time that is consumed during the management of inventory. The basic objective of Industry 4.0 is to lessen the participation of human operators and to emphasize the automation systems. However, this objective has changed in Industry 5.0, which aims to achieve the maximum benefits through the human–machine interaction by maintaining a balance. Industry 5.0 aims to strengthen the interaction between ever-increasing powerful machinery and the productive abilities of human beings. This paper introduces a detailed overview of IoT in enabling digital transformations and Industry 4.0. The authors have discussed the application of IoT in different industrial sectors, and how the concept of IIoT has evolved. In addition to this, the present paper highlights several research studies that enable the authors to elicit the major challenges, implementation analysis, and future scope of IIoT.

AB  - Staying at the top is getting tougher and more challenging due to the fast-growing and changing digital technologies and AI-based solutions. The world of technology, mass customization, and advanced manufacturing is experiencing a rapid transformation. Robots are becoming even more important as they can now be coupled with the human mind by means of brain–machine interface and advances in artificial intelligence. A strong necessity to increase productivity while not removing human workers from the manufacturing industry is imposing punishing challenges on the global economy. To counter these challenges, this article introduces the concept of Industry 5.0, where robots are intertwined with the human brain and work as collaborator instead of competitor. This article also outlines a number of key features and concerns that every manufacturer may have about Industry 5.0. In addition, it presents several developments achieved by researchers for use in Industry 5.0 applications and environments. Finally, the impact of Industry 5.0 on the manufacturing industry and overall economy is discussed from an economic and productivity point of view, where it is argued that Industry 5.0 will create more jobs than it will take away.

AB  - The development of modern industrial production, based on the principles of Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0, inevitably implies the introduction of a complete digitization of information flows used for business management. The implementation and use of information technology by business organizations is the basis of their competitiveness and development opportunity, especially when it comes to optimizing supply chain management (SCM) processes. In this respect, it is necessary to improve the skills and competencies of entrepreneurs from different sectors, the main role being played by training for effective use of Supply Chain Management Systems (SCMS). Finally, each training should end with an evaluation and analysis of the information received from the feedback received from learners and trainers. This paper focuses on the process of conducting SCMS training for entrepreneurs and management staff, as well as the derivation of indicators to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of training. A general sequence of training is indicated.

AB  - The construction industry’s inherent fragmentation fuels Construction Supply Chain (CSC) complexity. Logistics form an essential part of the CSC in terms of costs and project management. In turn, transportation accounts for more than half the logistics costs due to construction materials being low-cost/high-volume, and most other logistics processes being business processes and not physical ones. Construction transport is almost entirely road bound, one of the least sustainable modes with externalities far out of proportion to its numbers. Ergo, its optimisation presents substantial greening (de-carbonisation) opportunity, with potentially far-reaching sustainability impacts. The ASI (Avoid-Shift-Improve) concept considers activity, modal structure, and energy intensity/efficiency as transport carbon components, providing a fundamental optimisation framework. 93% of New Zealand’s freight (a third of it construction related) is road bound, with 99% fossil-fuel (diesel) dependence. Government adoption of ASI elements viz Supply Chain (SC) efficiency, transport optimisation, data/information sharing, and collaboration for transport decarbonisation aligns with Industry 5.0, but seeks further research for concrete implementation pathways. This paper aims to bridge the gap by proposing a research framework for greening of construction transport as a sustainability enabler for New Zealand.

                    The paper proposes conceptual model of a digital platform for cyber-physical management of manufacturing enterprises in the upcoming era of Industry 5.0, characterized by the vision of any business, including industrial production or logistics, as a complex adaptive system built on fundamental principles of self-organization and evolution, as well as interaction of artificial intelligence systems and people. The first part discusses principles of building a digital platform that can support operation of an enterprise within Industry 5.0 as a digital ecosystem of smart services. This part of the paper proposes typing of vasic platform services, lists the minimum set of services of each type, and gives description of their functionality. It also substantiates the leading role of multi-agent systems as a basic software architecture and technology for developing applications of the digital eco-systems. The paper provides examples of digital platforms and ecosystems of smart services for management of cargo transportation of the Russian Railways on the principles of "uberisation", life cycle of complex technical products, as well as enterprises of the plant-growing industry. It is shown that results are applicable to modern industrial corporations and enterprises in industry and agriculture, logistics, design, consulting and service.

AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) that combine IoT (Internet of Things) and Cloud computation technologies are an emerging trend in Industry 5.0. Such systems could lead to a different manufacturing process closer to the current market needs. In addition, the factories can be more efficient, sustainable, and environmentally friendly. This work intends to explore a different approach to the manufacturing process, where there is no production planned behind and the shop floor is a provider of services for the products to be built. For that purpose, this paper proposes an executable model defining the interaction between the different actors and representing the digital counterpart of the CPS. We use a high-level graphical language to create the executable model that allows easy and flexible experimentation with different scenarios. Also, the model can be made as detailed as needed while providing a precise and readable simulation and a resulting detailed log amenable to further analysis.

AB  - Scholars believe that the newly introduced Industry 5.0 has the potential to move beyond the profit-centered productivity of Industry 4.0 and to promote sustainable development goals such as human-centricity, socio-environmental sustainability, and resilience. However, little has been done to understand how this ill-defined phenomenon may deliver its indented sustainability values despite these speculative promises. To address this knowledge gap, the present study developed a strategy roadmap that explains the mechanism by which Industry 5.0 delivers its intended sustainable development functions. The study first developed and introduced the Industry 5.0 reference model that describes the technical and functional properties of this phenomenon. The study further conducted a content-centric synthesis of the literature and identified the sustainable development functions of Industry 5.0. Next, the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique was employed to identify the sequential relationships among the functions and construct the Industry 5.0-enabled model of sustainable development. The ISM involved collecting the opinions of 11 Industry 5.0 experts through expert panel meetings. Results revealed that Industry 5.0 delivers sustainable development values through 16 functions. Circular intelligent products, employee technical assistance, intelligent automation, open sustainable innovation, renewable integration, and supply chain adaptability are examples of the functions identified. These functions are highly interrelated and should be developed in a specific order so that the synergies and complementarities among them would maximize the sustainable development value gains. The roadmap to Industry 5.0-driven sustainability developed in this study is expected to provide a better understanding of ways Industry 5.0 can contribute to sustainable development, explaining how the development of its functions should be managed to maximize their synergies and contribution to the intended sustainability values. The study also highlights important avenues for future research, emphasizing the potential enablers of Industry 5.0 development, such as Government 5.0 or Corporate Governance 5.0.

AB  - In recent years, the introduction of collaborative robotic solutions is constantly revolutionizing and innovating production processes by identifying new types of physical, cognitive, sensory, social and emotional interaction between user-operator and robot aimed at enhancing human capital. Starting from the preliminary study already realized on the different user-robot collaboration categorizations present in the literature (Formati et al, 2021), the new contribution, through the review of the still insufficient regulatory framework, ergonomic factors and robotic systems existing in the manufacturing field, returns the definition of further specifications about the collaboration modalities. In the current technological ecosystem, through the discipline of design is possible to prefigure and reinforce the collaborative processes through the introduction of new protocols and tools to support the regulatory standards, synthesis and evolution of the investigated categorizations, in order to optimize the production system as a whole and improve the working conditions of the operator with the robotic systems in terms of predictability, reliability, and usability.

AB  - Advanced manufacturing solutions, augmented reality, and cloud and big data are technologies pertaining to Industry 4.0. These technologies improve working conditions, create new business models, and increase both productivity and firm quality production. However, they can also improve life and society as a whole. This new perspective, oriented toward social and global well-being, is called Society 5.0. As has happened for all past industrial revolutions, Industry 4.0 will support the transition to a different society, i.e., Society 5.0. In this transition, open innovation and value co-creation can play an important role. The aim of the study was twofold: to examine how Industry 4.0 features and enabling technologies can support the transition to Society 5.0 and to investigate the roles of both open innovation and value co-creation within this transition. A conceptual framework was developed to jointly consider for the first time Industry 4.0, Society 5.0, open innovation, and value co-creation, which are all challenging issues that firms must cope with nowadays. Managers could profit from these insights to design ad hoc strategies in order to benefit from the opportunities emerging from this transition and overcome the main related challenges.

AB  - Current research on smart contracts focuses on technical, conceptual, and legal aspects but neglects organizational requirements and sustainability impacts. We consider this a significant research gap and explore the relationship between smart contracts and sustainability in supply chains. First, we define the concept of smart contracts in terms of supply chain management. Then, we conduct a content analysis of the literature to explore the overlapping research fields of smart contracts and sustainability in supply chains. Next, we develop a semi-structured assessment framework to model the potential environmental and social impacts induced by smart contracts on supply chains. We propose a conceptual framework for supply chain maturity by mapping the relationships between organizational development, sustainability, and technology. We identify smart contracts as a foundational technology that enables efficient and transparent governance and collaborative self-coordination of human and non-human actors. Thus, we argue that smart contracts can contribute to the economic and social development of networked value chains and Society 5.0. To stimulate interdisciplinary research on smart contracts, we conclude the article by formulating research propositions and trade-offs for smart contracts in the context of technology development, business process and supply chain management, and sustainability.

AB  -  Purpose This study aims to empirically examine the effect of supply chain innovation (SCI) announcements on shareholder value within the context of Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0.   Design/methodology/approach This study uses an event study method to examine the effect of SCI announcements on shareholder value of the 156 listed companies in China.   Findings  First, SCI announcements have a positive effect on shareholder value. Second, SCI with an integrated form more positively affects shareholder value than SCI with an independent form. SCI at the strategy level more positively affects shareholder value than SCI at the operation level. Technology-type SCI more positively affects shareholder value than process-type SCI. Third, this study finds that investors pay more attention to the SCI of companies in the service industry than that of in the manufacturing industry. Finally, the post-hoc analysis finds that digital SCI more positively affects shareholder value than intelligent SCI.    Originality/value First, most scholars use questionnaire data rather than second-hand data to conduct empirical research to explore the impact of SCI on performance. Second, although scholars focus on performance comprehensively, including operational, financial, relational and environmental performance, no scholars use an event study to explore the impact of SCI on the stock market. Third, no scholars have explored the differential impact of SCI in different industries. Forth, few scholars have classified SCI according to the characteristics to explore the differential impact of SCI. Finally, the differences between SCI of Industry 4.0 and SCI of Industry 5.0 have been described, but no scholars have used empirical research to explore the differences.

AB  - Textile MSMEs are going through a period of instability and greater difficulty in executing their operations due to factors derived from the pandemic, globalization, policies, and environmental and social needs. This is driving companies to abandon classic methods and turn to the use of innovative concepts as manners to promote sustainability and resilience. One of these concepts is Industry 5.0, which, according to the European Commission, focuses on sustainable manufacturing and operator well-being and complements Industry 4.0 as it seeks to improve factory efficiency through technology by placing the human being at the center of development. At the same time, it minimizes environmental and social impacts and enhances resilience. Aware that implementing these new trends is a challenge for MSMEs, this study contributes to the generation of indicators to evaluate elements of Industry 5.0 in the textile production of MSMEs, supporting the development and implementation of strategies focused on this area. The construction of the set of indicators is based on a 3-phase framework that consists of doing a systematic literature review, selecting the indicators by a process of analysis and comparison, and expanding their characteristics through elaborating data sheets. As part of the results, 172 indicators completed a rigorous selection and validation process. These will serve as the basis for developing sustainable, resilient, and human-centered production models that can be carried out in future research.

We still need more practical guidelines and cases to get an understanding of how, or whether Industry 5.0 could be relevant as an approach for manufacturing companies to meet the challenges they are facing. This paper investigates how Industry 5.0 can be the reference for developing capabilities needed for meeting the increasingly challenging market and sustainability requirements. To be able to capture all facets and effects of Industry 5.0, the sustainability, resilience and human centricity principles have to work jointly together aligned with roadmaps. This paper presents a platform for industry 5.0 capability development based upon literature that is tested in two firms in the agricultural industry. “The Core Product Service Platform” describing the products and services to deliver and capabilities needed to become an Industry 5.0 company.

AB  - In the next years, it will be increasingly important to re-think manufacturing and logistics systems from a human-centred perspective to promote a balanced use of automation and digital technologies to enhance the unique and irreplaceable capabilities of operators, who will continue to play a fundamental role in the factories of the future. The sixteen papers published in this special issue aim at contributing to the main emerging research streams about human-technology integration in the next-generation manufacturing and logistics systems. In particular, four main macro-topics have emerged: human-machine integration, human-robot collaboration, worker assistance systems and work design 4.0. In the papers, novel conceptual frameworks and architectures are presented and laboratory tests are carried out, promoting relevant advances in the field of human-technology integration. Nevertheless, the analysis of the papers in the special issue reveals that it is still necessary to investigate and explore human-technology integration, especially by developing interfaces that increasingly support the operators. At the same time, it is necessary to rethink the traditional workforce, taking more account of human factors, which intervene in the tasks of operators and managers in order to increase technology acceptability and usage. As a result, there is a growing need to move towards Industry 5.0, with human-centred and socially sustainable design and development of new manufacturing and logistics solutions.

AB  - Industry 5.0 constitutes a change of paradigm where the increase of economic benefits caused by a never-ending increment of production is no longer the only priority. Instead, Industry 5.0 addresses social and planetary challenges caused or neglected in Industry 4.0 and below. One relevant the most relevant challenges of Industry 5.0 is the design of human-centered smart environments (i.e., that prioritize human well-being while maintaining production performance). In these environments, robots and humans will share the same space and collaborate to reach common objectives. This article presents a literature review of the different aspects concerning the problem of quality measurement in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) applications for manufacturing environments. To help practitioners and new researchers in the area, this article presents an overview of factors, metrics, and measures used in the robotics community to evaluate performance and human well-being quality aspects in HRI applications. For this, we performed a systematic search in relevant databases for robotics (Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, ACM digital library, and Springer Link). We summarize and classify results extracted from 102 peer-reviewed research articles published until March 2022 in two definition models: 1) a taxonomy of performance aspects and 2) a Venn Diagram of common human factors in HRI. Additionally, we briefly explain the differences between often confusing or overlapped concepts in the area. We also introduce common human factors evaluated by the robotics community and identify seven emergent research topics which can have a relevant impact on Industry 5.0.

AB  -  Purpose The paper aims to explore the various dimensions of human factor relevant for integrating data-driven supply chain quality management practices (DDSCQMPs) with organizational performance. Keeping the transition phase from “Industry 4.0” to “Industry 5.0” in mind, the paper reinforces the role of the human factor and critically discusses the issues and challenges in the present organizational setup.   Design/methodology/approach Following the grounded theory approach, the study arranged in-depth interviews and focus group sessions with industry experts from various service-oriented firms in India. Dimensions of human factor identified from there were grouped together through a morphological analysis (MA), and interlinkages between them were explored through a cross-consistency matrix.   Findings This research work identified 20 critical dimensions of human factor and have grouped them under five important categories, namely, cohesive force, motivating force, regulating force, supporting force and functional force that drive quality performance in the supply chain domain.   Originality/value In line with the requirements of the present “Industry 4.0” and the forthcoming “Industry 5.0”, where the need to collaborate human factor with smart system gets priority, the paper made a novel attempt in presenting the critical human factors and categorizing them under important driving forces. The research also contributed in linking DDSCQMPs with organizational performance. The proposed framework can guide the future researchers in expanding the theoretical constructs through initiating further cross-cultural studies across industries.

AB  - Due to recent technology progress in areas such as IoT, AI, big data and robotics, Japanese industry is heading towards the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The industrial system is shifting from manufacturing worksite superiority to intelligence or software superiority in manufacturing. The government promotes these trends through its Society 5.0 initiative. Software superiority in manufacturing facilitates front loading; the conversion of skills to explicit knowledge makes progress in manufacturing processes through the use of IT and craftsmanship. This research deals with three cases. The first case is a company-developed system that’s scalable from customized products to standard products and that realizes diversified products via microscale production. The second case, focusing on the introduction of robots and a robot system integrator (SIer), is the keystone company within the SIer community; its business consists of robot engineering projects and FA educational system projects. The third case, metal 3D printing manufacturing, is invigorating. The company is the first service bureau in Japan that is capable of providing comprehensive services in the field of metal additive manufacturing (AM), handling everything from powder development and manufacture to prototyping and mass production needs. Clearly, IoT and the servitization of industry are the two wheels of a cart in industry, significantly transforming not only manufacturing sites but also business models. Although each case represents a different field of industry, each meets a unique and remarkable challenge in standardization, platform and ecosystem. In the digital age, IoT is an enabler and provides a background for transformation of business models. Through servitization, businesses can be the field for co-creation by feeding back the experience of learning-by-doing and reorganizing it. It is a powerful option for company to meet the challenge of service platform building.

AB  - The development of modern industrial production, based on the principles of Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0, inevitably implies the introduction of an entire digitalization of information flows used for managing the industrial enterprise. In this respect, the implementation of business information systems of the ERP class is an obligatory process for any modern production process, not only in order to optimize the internal processes for the company, but also because of the need for reliable and effective integration with other actors in the supply chain. This paper presents the author’s views on how to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of an ERP system in specific business conditions. In this respect, a group of indicators has been developed that account for the different influences on the efficiency and effectiveness of the implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning System.

AB  - This paper introduces an architecture – B2H – to enable a delay-tolerant public blockchain network (PBCN) in healthcare systems for Society 5.0. Healthcare systems in Society 5.0 envision an abstract paradigm that provides beyond health monitoring services to all the citizens of the society. These services include healthcare medical supply chain, clinical trial, and hospital management. To provide these services, the existing healthcare systems upload their important information, such as users’ health parameters, medicinal details, and clinical trial information into the cloud using PBCN (Ioppolo et al., 2020). Additionally, PBCN provides end-to-end security in uploading of such healthcare information in healthcare systems by decentralizing and distributing the information validation among multiple end-user devices. The existing PBCN-based healthcare systems enable its users to validate information before the transaction of healthcare information. Enabling such a facility in the healthcare systems of Society 5.0 increases the validation latency of PBCN in healthcare systems, considering the presence of a huge number of citizens in Society 5.0. On the other hand, the existing PBCN-based healthcare systems are unable to detect malicious end-users, which may degrade the efficiency of the healthcare systems of Society 5.0. We introduce B2H to address the issues of increasing validation latency and detecting malicious end-users in the healthcare systems of Society 5.0. The architecture of B2H utilizes the features of PBCN. B2H introduce a layer of validation service providers (VSPs) in a PBCN that collects information from the end-user, distributes it among multiple validation devices. VSP in B2H reduces the validation time by distributing the information among a specific set of validation devices (VDs). B2H also allows the end-user to optimally select a VSP and a VSP to select a set of validation devices optimally. Through extensive experiments, we observe that B2H performs better than the existing schemes by reducing 94%–95% average network delay, 88%–94% average energy consumption, and 94%–96% average cost.

AB  - The contemporary world becomes more and more volatile and unpredictable every year (dynamic development of technology—Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0, dynamic global changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic, great changes in consumer behavior, climate crisis, geopolitical disruptions). Individuals, companies, and supply chains face challenges emerging from economic, sociological, and political phenomena. These phenomena disrupt regular performance and limit the efficient functioning of companies and economies. Due to numerous relations and connections in the economy, disruptions in one area affect the others and spread, growing in range and severity. Hence, disruptions should be dealt with to provide continuity of supply chains and to ensure their efficient and effective performance. The study aims to identify crucial characteristics of disruptions to facilitate disruption minimization strategies. The characteristics of disruptions in supply chains are identified based on a literature review, synthesized and validated by the experts. A study is implemented to validate identified characteristics and to confront theoretical findings with the practical experience and observations of the experts. The results of the study are discussed and commented on. The conclusions from the study refer to the nature and characteristics of disruptions in the contemporary economy, equipping managers with useful knowledge when dealing with disruptions, and academics with observations that can stimulate further discussion on stability, flexibility, and resilience of companies and supply chains.

AB  - The last 20 years have brought significant developments to digital fabrication technology, known as additive manufacturing (3D printing), and it has finally started to shed its prototyping mantel in favor of an industrial one. Yet its innovations are in danger of being subsumed into existing commercial practices, as society arguably continues to underestimate its ability, in conjunction with data collection, analysis, and communication tools, to disrupt current systems and enable a more equitable distribution of manufacturing wealth, capability, and capacity. This chapter highlights the potential of emerging industrial technologies to support a shift towards a more human-centered, responsible society where social and environmental problems are addressed through systems that maximises cyberspace and physical space integration, through the reframing of higher education engineering curriculum and pedagogy for manufacturing in Society 5.0.

AB  - The ongoing Industry 4.0 is characterized by the connectivity between components in the manufacturing system. For modern machines, the Internet of Things is a built-in function. In contrast, there are legacy machines in deployment functioning without digital communication. The need to connect them became popular to improve overall production efficiency. As building a new smart factory as a greenfield investment is a capital-intensive choice, retrofitting the existing infrastructure with IoT capability is more reasonable than replacing them. However, this so-called brownfield development, or retrofitting, requires specific prerequisites, e.g., digitization status assessment, technical and connectivity development, management requirement, and operational need, representing a significant disadvantage: lack of scalability. In the meantime, Industry 5.0 is under human-centric priority, which poses new challenges to the retrofitted system. Aware of the challenge, this paper provides a systematic overview of brownfield development regarding technical difficulties, supporting technologies, and possible applications for the legacy system. The research scope focuses on available Industry 4.0 advancements but considers preparing for the forthcoming Industry 5.0. The proposed retrofitting project approach can be a guideline for manufacturers to transform their factories into intelligent spaces with minimal cost and effort but still gain the most applicable solution for management needs. The future direction for other research in brownfield development for Industry 5.0 is also discussed.

AB  - Industry 5.0 complements the Industry 4.0 paradigm by highlighting research and innovation as drivers for a transition to a sustainable, human-centric and resilient industry. In this context, new types of interactions between operators and machines are facilitated, that can be realized through artificial intelligence (AI) based and voice-enabled Digital Intelligent Assistants (DIA). Apart from the existing technological challenges, this direction requires new methodologies for the evaluation of such technological solutions that will be able to treat AI in manufacturing as a socio-technical system. In this paper, we propose a framework for the evaluation of voice-enabled AI solutions in Industry 5.0, which consists of four dimensions: the trustworthiness of the AI system; the usability of the DIA; the cognitive workload of individual users; and the overall business benefits for the corporation.

AB  -  The paper proposes conceptual model of a digital platform for cyber-physical management of modern enterprises in the upcoming era of Industry 5.0. Unlike Industry 4.0, which focuses on automation of physical processes, Industry 5.0 is oriented on digitization of knowledge and automation of reasoning processes for creating artificial intelligence that is able to manage enterprises. This still emerging era will be characterized by the vision of any business, including industrial production or logistics, as a complex adaptive system built on fundamental principles of self-organization and evolution, as well as interaction of artificial intelligence systems and humans. The paper shows that implementation of such production and logistics management systems will require development of new models and decision-making methods based on knowledge and semantic information processing, integration of computational and communication components, accumulation of big data and its processing for predictive analytics, blockchain technologies for fixing mutual obligations of systems components in the for m of smar t contracts, as well as human-machine and software inter faces. Existing approaches to creation of digital platforms within the digital economy of Industry 4.0 and their limitations are analyzed. The concept of digital ecosystem is developed as an open, distributed, self-organized "system of systems" of smart services capable of coming up with solutions and automatically resolving conflicts through negotiations and concessions. The concept of the digital platform within Industry 5.0 is described, which will be able to support functioning of the digital ecosystem of "smart services" of cyberphysical management of both individual objects and enterprises of humans and robots, and in the future, industries of such enterprises — implemented using self-organizing autonomous agents at all levels.

AB  - This article aims at contributing to the celebration of the 25th Anniversary of Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review (TRE). It provides an overview of the role of Facility Location in Logistics and Transportation highlighting the contribution of TRE to such an enduring relationship. Several conventional problems are revisited showing that the three above fields have been intertwined for a long time. Nevertheless, the role of Facility Location has become even stronger in the past decades due to challenges posed by new technological developments together with a fast economy globalization and a strong increase in environmental concerns. This has called for the study of more complex problems and the development of comprehensive mathematical models leading to major advances in areas such as reverse and green logistics, humanitarian supply chains, and multimodal transportation, to mention a few. These and other related topics are discussed. Hedging against uncertainty has gained much practical relevance and thus it will be much in focus throughout the paper. Several current trends and future challenges are thoroughly discussed. These include but are not limited to the steps already made and those still missing for paving the way from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0, as well as the challenges posed by data-driven decision making in the Era of big data.

AB  -  Research background: At a time when we are looking for ways to recover the economy most effectively from a global pandemic, digitalization represents a significant opportunity. This is a specific aspect of digitalization, i.e. automation through artificial intelligence-driven technologies, in various areas of society, particularly in the industry and related education.   Purpose of the article: The aim of this article is to present the changes in the labour market and education in the context of the global pandemic. Even after the end of the pandemic, it will be necessary to continue increasing productivity through the use of modem technologies. Education will no longer be tailored to one profession, as it has been so far, but shall emphasise interdisciplinarity, comprehensiveness, creativity and flexibility. The Fifth Industrial Revolution (Industry 5.0) will logically follow. It is a vision of the return of a man and his creativity to the production processes.   Methods: The paper analyses the survey of the international research into the global crisis caused by the pandemic using desk research and mathematical statistics methods.   Findings and added value: Many professions tend to be at risk as work becomes increasingly digitalized and automated. This article looks at the possible evolution of the market and the emergence of new professions that cannot be imagined now. Therefore, it is very important to focus education in all areas of society to prepare the graduates to be able to flexibly respond to changes in the labour market requirements.

AB  - Today, sustainable innovation is designed to develop from the lineal model to the circular one. Attempts are made to offer – starting from an upgrade of knowledge and educational paths – a new innovative society (known as Society 5.0 or Super Smart Society) where companies and territorial stakeholders are a part of complex relation systems leading to the creation of new sustainable and intertwined supply chains (territorial networking), also with the support of properly designed tools such as the service platforms. In this scenario, design develops new planning visions based on relational paradigms and represents the bridge between technological innovation and social contexts since it is able to plan technology by harmonizing cultural, social, economical and political elements.

AB  - Enterprises and societies currently face crucial challenges, while Industry 4.0 becomes important in the global manufacturing industry all the more. Industry 4.0 offers a range of opportunities for companies to increase the flexibility and efficiency of production processes. The development of new business models can be promoted with digital platforms and architectures for Industry 4.0. Therefore, products from the healthcare sector can increase in value. The adaptive integrated digital architecture framework (AIDAF) for Industry 4.0 is expected to promote and implement the digital platforms and robotics for healthcare and medical communities efficiently. In this paper, we propose that various digital platforms and robotics are designed and evaluated for digital healthcare as for manufacturing industry with Industry 4.0. We argue that the design of an open healthcare platform “Open Healthcare Platform 2030 - OHP2030” for medical product design and robotics can be developed with AIDAF. The vision of AIDAF applications to enable Industry 4.0 in the OHP2030 research initiative is explained and referenced, extended in the context of Society 5.0.

AB  -  Purpose The purpose of this paper is 1) to investigate the effects on the crucial Industry 4.0 technological innovations that interact between the real and virtual worlds and that are applied in the sustainable supply chain process; 2) to contribute to the identification of the opportunities, the challenges and the gaps that will support the new research study developments and 3) to analyze the impact of the Industry 4.0 technologies as facilitators of the sustainable supply chain performance in the midst of the Coronavirus (COVID-19).   Design/methodology/approach This research is performed through a bibliographic review in the electronic databases of the Emerald Insight, the Scopus and the Web of Science, considering the main scientific publications on the subject.   Findings The bibliographic search results in 526 articles, followed by two sequential filters for deleting the duplicate articles (resulting in 487 articles) and for selecting the most relevant articles (resulting in 150 articles).   Practical implications This article identifies the opportunities and the challenges focused on the emerging Industry 4.0 theme. The opportunities can contribute to the sustainable performance of the supply chains and their territories. The Industry 4.0 can also generate challenges like the social inequalities related to the position of the man in the labor market by replacing the human workforce with the machines. Therefore, the man-machine relationship in the Industry 4.0 era is analyzed as a gap in the literature. Therefore, as a way to fill this gap, the authors of this article suggest the exploration of the research focused on the Society 5.0. Also known as “super-smart society,” this recent theme appeared in Japan in April 2016. According to Fukuda (2020), in addition to the focus on the technological development, the Society 5.0 also aims at the quality of life and the social challenge resolutions.   Originality/value This article contributes to the analysis of the Industry 4.0 technologies as facilitators in the sustainable supply chain performance. It addresses the impacts of the Industry 4.0 technologies applied to the supply chains in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it analyzes the research gaps and limitations found in the literature. The result of this study can add value and stimulate new research studies related to the application of the Industry 4.0 technologies as facilitators in the supply chain sustainable performance. It can encourage the studies related to the COVID-19 impacts on the sustainable supply chains, and it can promote the research development on the relationship among the man, the machine and the labor in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

AB  - Over time, industrial revolutions have marked human existence and the work environment, impacting efficiency, effectiveness, and productivity. In the new promoted concept, Industry 5.0, it is expected that humans interact with robots, known as cobots, in a collaborative working space using innovative technologies. This chapter brings some new insights on the way the components of Industry 5.0 readiness model influence value added reported by countries, for the period between 2017 and 2019, on four levels of analysis, namely: (i) country gross value added; (ii) environmental activities value added; (iii) ICT sector value added; (iv) labour productivity. Our results prove that selected components of the Industry 5.0 readiness model determine a positive marginal effect on the value added reported by countries. We also registered a significant influence on the development of the circular economy, in strong relation with the development of the knowledge economy. This highlights the fact that the results of the research are efficiently implemented on manufacturing operations by highly skilled employees, leading to increase firms’ performance, improving at the same time the cooperation between humans and smart machines, as stated in the Industry 5.0 framework.

AB  - Over the years, organizations have had to adapt to constant changes in their surroundings. To this end, they began to adopt methodologies such as lean manufacturing and Industry 4.0. Their implementation has increased the competitiveness of organizations. Sustainability is getting much attention, leading to the advent of Industry 5.0, which, unlike Industry 4.0, takes sustainable production into account. Forestry sectors are significant for the Portuguese economy, especially cork. This study examines a company in the cork sector to determine how automation and monetization of new resources could increase efficiency, quality, and safety. A qualitative approach was applied in the study through literature review and participant observation actions to analyze and propose improvements. The study fulfilled the purposes defined, identifying options to improve the production process and increase customer satisfaction and worker safety.

AB  - This article provides a review about how uncertainties in increasingly complex production and supply chains should be addressed in scheduling tasks. Uncertainty management will be particularly important in Industry 5.0 solutions that will require the close integration of operators and technical systems. To prepare for these challenging developments, this work reviews the sources of uncertainty and the scheduling algorithms that deal with the different types of models developed to handle the uncertain nature of the elements and the environment of complex technological systems. The paper not only identifies the challenges, but also the main building blocks that can help to manage and reduce uncertainties based on the I4.0 and I5.0 solutions. We hope that this study will serve as a starting point for R&D projects and algorithm developments, which will be needed primarily in the field of multi-agent, multistage and inverse optimizations.

AB  - The recent shift to wellbeing, sustainability, and resilience under Industry 5.0 has prompted formal discussions that manufacturing should be human-centric – placing the wellbeing of industry workers at the center of manufacturing processes, instead of system-centric – only driven by efficiency and quality improvement and cost reduction. However, there is a lack of shared understanding of the essence of human-centric manufacturing, though significant research efforts exist in enhancing the physical and cognitive wellbeing of operators. Therefore, this position paper presents our arguments on the concept, needs, reference model, enabling technologies and system frameworks of human-centric manufacturing, providing a relatable vision and research agenda for future work in human-centric manufacturing systems. We believe human-centric manufacturing should ultimately address human needs defined in an Industrial Human Needs Pyramid – from basic needs of safety and health to the highest level of esteem and self-actualization. In parallel, human-machine relationships will change following a 5C evolution map – from current Coexistence, Cooperation and Collaboration to future Compassion and Coevolution. As such, human-centric manufacturing systems need to have bi-directional empathy, proactive communication and collaborative intelligence for establishing trustworthy human-machine coevolution relationships, thereby leading to high-performance human-machine teams. It is suggested that future research focus should be on developing transparent, trustworthy and quantifiable technologies that provide a rewarding working environment driven by real-world needs.

AB  - Although manufacturing companies are currently situated at a transition point in what has been called Industry 4.0, a new revolutionary wave—Industry 5.0—is emerging as an ‘Age of Augmentation’ when the human and machine reconcile and work in perfect symbiosis with one another. Recent years have indeed assisted in drawing attention to the human-centric design of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) and to the genesis of the ‘Operator 4.0’, two novel concepts that raise significant ethical questions regarding the impact of technology on workers and society at large. This paper argues that a value-oriented and ethical technology engineering in Industry 5.0 is an urgent and sensitive topic as demonstrated by a survey administered to industry leaders from different companies. The Value Sensitive Design (VSD) approach is proposed as a principled framework to illustrate how technologies enabling human–machine symbiosis in the Factory of the Future can be designed to embody elicited human values and to illustrate actionable steps that engineers and designers can take in their design projects. Use cases based on real solutions and prototypes discuss how a design-for-values approach aids in the investigation and mitigation of ethical issues emerging from the implementation of technological solutions and, hence, support the migration to a symbiotic Factory of the Future.

AB  - The fourth industrial revolution carries with it various expectations for the future of sustainable and effective development. Industry 4.0 takes a significant part of everyday life. There is no way. The application of digital life on smart phones, touch screens and smart classrooms may be significant indicators of this. Not just computer information and life but also human-like robotics would take a long time. In the immediate future, you will also see the picture of a modern 5.0 model for manufacturing. Since of emerging technology and increasingly evolving and increasing AI-based approaches, remaining on the top is getting more and more challenging. Robots are much more relevant as now the brain-machine’s technology can be merged with the human mind, as artificial intelligence advances. There are coercive problems in the world economy because efficiency is to be improved without the human workforce being robbed of the manufacturing sector. This paper presents the idea of sustainable business 5.0, where machines are intertwined with the human brain and function as partners rather than rivals, against these obstacles. In addition, the effect of Industry 5.0, which is more likely to create more jobs than to reduce, will be discussed on manufacturing and the economy as a whole. The paper describes modern technology, from IoT to news. Thanks to our view, the integration of these innovations would turn industry 4.0 into industry 5.0.

AB  - Fourth industrial revolution is the introduction of ICT (mostly IoT) in industry and elsewhere, which enables the creation of cyber-physical systems, i.e., digital twins of reality. The application of widespread digitization of processes brings changes in terms of increased efficiency of processes, increased flexibility of production, and the possibility of realizing prosocial and pro-ecological goals, such as sustainable development, sustainable production and consumption, and reducing the consumption of increasingly expensive energy. Nowadays, the high autonomy of cyber-physical systems and benefits to society are expected by including human factors within the Industry 5.0 concept. Implementing the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies and meeting the expectations of sustainable development also means new challenges for the knowledge and skills of industry employees, mainly engineers implementing modern solutions. Hence, the article’s aim is to identify the critical knowledge and skills of engineers responsible for implementing the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies. The achievements and results presented in the article were obtained based on research conducted among experts from the University of Pennsylvania (USA). The study considers aspects connected to the problems of implementing the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies and identifies the benefits and risks of their implementation for Society 5.0.

Grounding on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Socio-Technical Systems theory (STS), this study proposes a conceptual model to better understanding critical factors that influence the acceptance of cobots and how these factors can drive perceived work performance improvement in the organizational level. This study was conducted by catching the critical issue, reviewing the literature on the subject of this study, identifying previous research gaps, and subsequently developing constructs of the model. As a result, this study offers valuable contributions to robotics and manufacturing literature and further suggests empirical research to generally examine and validate the conceptual model.

AB  - Industry 5.0 follows the steps of the Industry 4.0 paradigm and seeks for revolutionizing the way industries operate. In fact, Industry 5.0 focuses on research and innovation to support industrial production sustainability and place the well-being of industrial workers at the center of the production process. Thus, Industry 5.0 relies on three pillars: it is human-centric, it encourages sustainability and it is aimed at developing resilience against disruptions. Such core aspects cannot be fully achieved without a transparent end-to-end human-centered traceability throughout the value chain. As a consequence, Auto-Identification (Auto-ID) technologies play a key role, since they are able to provide automated item recognition, positioning and tracking without human intervention or in cooperation with industrial operators. Although the most popular Auto-ID technologies provide a certain degree of security and productivity, there are still open challenges for future Industry 5.0 factories. This article analyzes and evaluates the Auto-ID landscape and delivers a holistic perspective and understanding of the most popular and the latest technologies, looking for solutions that cope with harsh, diverse and complex industrial scenarios. In addition, it describes a methodology for selecting Auto-ID technologies for Industry 5.0 factories. Such a methodology is applied to a specific use case of the shipbuilding industry that requires identifying the main components of a ship during its construction and repair. To validate the outcomes of the methodology, a practical evaluation of passive and active UHF RFID tags was performed in an Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV) under construction, showing that a careful selection and evaluation of the tags enables product identification and tracking even in areas with a very high density of metallic objects. As a result, this article serves as a useful guide for industrial stakeholders, including future developers and managers that seek for deploying identification and traceability technologies in Industry 5.0 scenarios.

AB  - At present in Europe and Russia there are active discussions of the next mega stage of human social and economic development. It concerns the Industry 5.0 concept. In 2020–2021 members of scientific research and technological organizations discussed the aspects of Industry 5.0 at a number of well-known European and Russian forums. Major attention was paid to technologies maintaining Industry 5.0. As a result the world scientific community reached a consensus on two fronts: firstly, on integration of opportunities of the existing technologies of Industry 4.0 with the human-oriented approach of Industry 5.0 which will give way to harmonious interaction of human intelligence with cognitive calculations; and, secondly, on integration of human and machine intelligence to create collective intelligence which will make it possible to avoid technological singularity in future as well as provide for simultaneous humans’ evolution and technologies’ development. These will become the basis for creating a fundamentally new social, economic and cultural strategy of the society’s development for the coming decades. The strategy is based on applying collective intelligence and meta-system technologies in all spheres of life. For the first time in the world scientific practice the authors introduce the concept of Industry 5.0 as a cyber social system which allows the alliance of human and artificial intelligence aimed at creating collective super intelligence and becomes a source of harmonious technological development of human civilization. The authors present a neuro-ecosystem model of Industry 5.0 concept which will make it possible to set the task of implementing the systems of global meta-system strategized development of cognitive production and industry. Such systems are established as part of organization of cognitive production and new types of social and economic, cyber-social and industrial ecosystems by means of implementing collective intelligence and neuro-digital meta-technologies. This is the first stage of a new evolution process of developing Industry 4.0 concept, transition to Industry 5.0 and to meta-system transformations economics.

AB  - Enterprises and information societies confront crucial challenges currently, while Industry 4.0 becomes important in the global manufacturing industry and Society 5.0 should contribute to a supersmart society, especially for healthcare. Physical activity monitoring digital platforms are architected to improve the healthcare status of patients with diabetes and other lifestyle-related diseases. Furthermore, digital platforms are expected to generate profits for health technology companies and help control costs in the healthcare ecosystem. However, current digital enterprise architecture approaches are not well-established, and the potentials have not yet been realized. Design thinking approach and agile software development methodologies can overcome these limitations, beginning with proof of concept and pilot projects and then scaling to the production environment. In this paper, we describe how that the adaptive integrated digital architecture framework (AIDAF) for Design Thinking approach is proposed and verified in a case of a university hospital in the Americas. In addition, challenges and future activities for this area are discussed that cover the directions for Society 5.0.

AB  - With the emergence of Industry 5.0, the human-centric manufacturing paradigm requires manufacturing equipment (robots, etc.) interactively assist human workers to deal with dynamic and complex production tasks. To achieve symbiotic human–robot interaction (HRI), the safety issue serves as a prerequisite foundation. Regarding the growing individualized demand of manufacturing tasks, the conventional rule-based safe HRI measures could not well address the safety requirements due to inflexibility and lacking synergy. To fill the gap, this work proposes a mutual-cognitive safe HRI approach including worker visual augmentation, robot velocity control, Digital Twin-enabled motion preview and collision detection, and Deep Reinforcement Learning-based robot collision avoidance motion planning in the Augmented Reality-assisted manner. Finally, the feasibility of the system design and the performance of the proposed approach are validated by establishing and executing the prototype HRI system in a practical scene.

AB  - Industry 4.0 (Fourth Industrial Revolution) and green process manufacturing are similar to each other and work closely as they are new concepts in manufacturing production & operations management. Today the need of expansion in businesses directly leads to adoption of new concepts of manufacturing and also making awareness of those used processes to ultimate consumers is needed. Industry 4.0 is related to the processes with latest technologies such as clean-green energy, automation, internet of things (IoT) and digitization, whereas, green manufacturing is almost similar like use of fewer natural resources, reduction in pollution & waste, reducing carbon footprints, recycle & reuse of material and moderate emission in processes. Country’s sustainable growth right now is major among other strategies and every country is trying and working hard to incorporate the development process through adoption of these types of tools & techniques. Industry 4.0 technologies and green manufacturing relate to “Green Dialogue” and to some extent proving the object also. Now, introduction of Industry 5.0 is welcoming fully fledged automation of industries with green processes like G-IoT. However, climate health, consumers health and production & operation health is on priority to have healthier green clean sustainable development in the world. From the above title, the purpose of this study is to present the potential of the industries under new industrial revolution with the combination to eco-friendly manufacturing leading to knowledge of the updated technologies used for their respective ecological production & operation management. These concepts are considered to be new around the world and most of the developed countries are more active in accepting these sustainable concepts in their operations and production in industries. Developing countries like India are way behind in acquiring these concepts as manufacturing is aware but not willing to pay extra cost of production in advancing the operation & production process. Most of the top manufacturers of India have already started using this sustainable process as they have to prove their responsibility towards society at large by Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) also.

AB  - Technological innovations play a crucial role in designing an effective green supply chain. However, it is crucial to know the factors influencing technological innovation in a green supply chain. Some preconceptions show that technological innovation in a business can be affected by internal and external factors, and therefore there must be correlations between such factors to flourish the technological innovation and, subsequently, the green supply chain. Besides, predicting the technological innovation level in a supply chain can be vital and direct it to the Industry 5.0 goals. In this research, a 3-phased framework will be proposed to predict the Technological Innovation Level of Green Supply Chains. The scope of this research includes Green Investment, Eco-friendly Design and Customer Collaborations. In the 1st phase of the framework, dependent and independent factors considering the scope of the Research will be determined; and then, using statistical data analysis, the weight of factors, which reflects their impact on technological innovation (dependent factor), will be determined. Then, in the 2nd phase, a comprehensive model will be developed and trained. Using the data of supply chains that were gathered in the first phase, the train and test data would be selected. In continuation, the model will be trained and its performance will be evaluated using some metrics. Then, in the last phase (phase 3), the developed model will be used to predict the technological level of supply chains. The outcomes of this research can help top managers of supply chains to predict the level of technological innovation by investing a certain budget in improving the dependent variables. The outcomes demonstrated that Customer Collaboration (0.481), Eco-friendly design (0.419) and Green Investment (0.41) have significant impacts on technological innovation improvement in the studied cases, respectively. Besides, the results showed the superiority of the K-nearest Neighbor algorithm while using the Minkowski distance method and considering 5 neighbors. The findings indicated that the proposed framework could predict Technological Innovation with 0.751 accuracies. The outcomes of this research can be helpful for industry owners to predict the expected technological innovation level of their system by investing a certain budget in green investment, eco-friendly design and customer collaborations in their enterprises.

AB  - In the XX century, arises the mass production implemented by Henry Ford to overcome the period of crisis lived in the World. In 1988, the term Lean emerged and this philosophy successfully challenged the mass production implemented in the automotive industry, focused on customers’ requirements and satisfaction with the minimum use of resources and waste elimination. A Lean environment can be a promoter in the implementation of the fourth industrial revolution, named Industry 4.0 (I4.0). In the succession of Industry 4.0 emerged the Society 5.0 in Japan, as a strategy to deal with the impact of an ageing population. The focus of this quiet revolution is the humankind and the creation of conditions to promote a happy, motivated and satisfied society with more time for leisure and consequently increase productivity and wealth. This article presents a historical approach to the technological evolution of productive systems, and their influence on societies.

AB  - Smart machine companions such as artificial intelligence (AI) assistants and collaborative robots are rapidly populating the factory floor. Future factory floor workers will work in teams that include both human co-workers and smart machine actors. The visions of Industry 5.0 describe sustainable, resilient, and human-centered future factories that will require smart and resilient capabilities both from next-generation manufacturing systems and human operators. What kinds of approaches can help design these kinds of resilient human–machine teams and collaborations within them? In this paper, we analyze this design challenge, and we propose basing the design on the joint cognitive systems approach. The established joint cognitive systems approach can be complemented with approaches that support human centricity in the early phases of design, as well as in the development of continuously co-evolving human–machine teams. We propose approaches to observing and analyzing the collaboration in human–machine teams, developing the concept of operations with relevant stakeholders, and including ethical aspects in the design and development. We base our work on the joint cognitive systems approach and propose complementary approaches and methods, namely: actor–network theory, the concept of operations and ethically aware design. We identify their possibilities and challenges in designing and developing smooth human–machine teams for Industry 5.0 manufacturing systems.

AB  - Despite the current slowdown in global economic growth due to the impact of COVID-19, the digital economy is still performing well. Under the background of double carbon, green innovation and intelligent production of manufacturing enterprises have become the general trend of sustainable development. It is particularly important to study the integration of digital technology into green innovation and production processes to improve the performance of digital green innovation and the competitiveness of enterprises. However, the integration of digital technology and green innovation from the perspective of knowledge management has not been fully introduced into current literatures. In this study, hierarchical regression and fsQCA approaches were used to empirically verify the adoption process of digital green innovation activities and the impact of digital green knowledge creation on digital green innovation performance (DGIP), and explores the moderating effects of digital green risk perception (DGRP) and digital green complexity perception (DGCC) through 429 questionnaires from Chinese manufacturing enterprises. In addition, knowledge search is divided into three dimensions: scientific digital green knowledge search (SDGKS), market digital green knowledge search (MDGKS) and supply chain digital green knowledge search (SCDGKS). The results show that: i) SDGKS promotes exploitative digital green knowledge creation (EDGKC). MDGKS has a positive impact on both utilizing digital green knowledge creation (ADGKC) and EDGKC. SCDGKS promotes EDGKC. ii) The relationship between SDGKS and EDGKC is only moderated by DGCC (positive). The relationship between MDGKS and EDGKC is only moderated by DGCC (negative). The relationship between SCDGKS and EDGKC is moderated by DGRP (negative) and DGCC (negative). iii) There is an inverted U-shaped relationship between ADGKC and DGIP. There is a U-shaped relationship between EDGKC and DGIP. The essence of this study is to help manufacturing enterprises find external partners to improve their digital green innovation performance through external knowledge search partner selection. The conclusion of this study has certain theoretical contribution to the clarification of the complex process of digital green innovation. This study provides a theoretical basis for enterprises to select knowledge search partners according to their own environment to carry out digital green innovation activities smoothly. This study has practical value for enterprises to improve competitiveness, better survival and development process under the current environment.

AB  - The research objective of the present article is to study new world trends in industrial deve¬lopment and the reaction speed of national governments, companies and workers to technological changes. As research methods, analysis and synthesis of current world trends were applied, as well as special methods were used: expert assessments of international organizations were analyzed, a comparative and economic-statistical analysis was carried out. As a result, the distinctive features of Industry 5.0 are highlighted – this is the coexistence of industry and new social and environmental trends and needs. Change is inevitable: green energy and sustainable products will initially be a monopoly factor and benefit insiders. It is emphasized that in order to achieve global competitiveness, companies need to transform established business models and invest in technology and network forms of business, taking into account social goals: in addition to creating new jobs and ensuring flexible employment, we are talking about personalization of goods and greening. The poli¬tical and economic goals of the fifth industrial revolution and the direction of technological innovations are considered. It is emphasized that technology, according to the new approach, should serve people and society, which means that the technology used in production adapts to the needs and diversity of industry workers. The leaders are artificial intelligence, quantum information and semiconductors. Technological transformation is based on the development of the following areas: individual technologies for human-machine interaction, biotechnology and smart materials, artificial intelligence, digital twins, data transmission, storage and analysis technologies, as well as energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, storage and autonomy. It is an ecosystem-based innovation policy with a flexible focus on results. It is noted that technological transformation will help solve a number of unique social problems. It puts a bold focus from individual technologies to a system approach that allows the industry to achieve social goals beyond job creation and growth, and puts the well-being of industry workers at the center of the production process. In conclusion, the techno-social nature of the fifth revolution is revealed, with technology as tools and social needs as the ultimate goal.

AB  - In Industry 5.0 paradigm, AI-based systems are the essential component for the Internet of Things. In most applications, Industry 5.0 showed a significant connection between intelligent systems and humans through accurate manufacturing automation with critical thinking skills. Also, Industry 5.0 brings several competent tools that help organizations work inexpensively and instantly change without any principal investment. In recent years, smart devices, wireless communication, and sensor nodes have made considerable advances, making the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of interconnected, Internet-connected devices that can capture and transmit data without the need for human interaction over a wireless network. With the introduction of IoT, human beings take some relaxed and unburden feelings. IoT devices enable users to obtain information even in rural surroundings and prepare reports without restrictions. In addition, they accurately guide human beings with intelligent judgments via communication, as mentioned earlier, technologies. Numerous connected devices collect a considerable quantity of raw sensed data, where it needs pre-processing. However, only it turns into something valuable because of IoT devices’ adequate resources entailed to edge computing. Artificial intelligence-based algorithms are the necessary means for information inference in edge computing. Besides, the sensed data accumulated from IoT applications are generally unstructured and need further analysis, where AI-based models help extract relevant information.Furthermore, transmitting data from device to device, there is a chance for malicious attacks. Hence, this chapter explores Industry 5.0, IoT architecture, and AI-based IoT; we analyze IoT network’s technical details; communication enables technologies. Then we discussed various AI-based technologies integrated into IoT, AI-based tools, edge computing, and trust models for IoT appliances.

AB  - Abstract  Currently, there is growing attention towards improving sustainability, including the worldwide agenda in moving towards Society 5.0. Since the formulation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the green logistics issue has been widely recognized as one crucial element to reducing environmental and social impact. Nevertheless, only a few studies in this area were established since the ignorance regarding this issue was immense globally, including in the Malaysian context. This paper intends to examine the relationship of organizational performance consciousness, economic performance consciousness, and environmental performance consciousness towards green logistics consciousness in enlightening environmental and social sustainability in the Malaysian situation. The data of 387 respondents throughout Malaysia were collected using a convenience survey sampling technique. This data was initially analyzed via descriptive, validity, reliability, and normality test using IBM SPSS Statistics. All hypotheses were analysed using the hierarchical regression analysis, which confirmed that organizational performance consciousness, economic performance consciousness, and environmental performance consciousness directly influence green logistics consciousness in Malaysia. This study is significant and crucial for business strategies formulation, predicting and assessing the potential environmental and social impacts of a proposed project, including evaluating alternatives, designing appropriate mitigation, management and monitoring measures via several entities such as government and policymakers.

AB  - Needs for new competences and knowledge arise as industry 4.0 evolves in increasingly digitalized production. This development entails that job transformations and future skills need attention from the perspective of industry 5.0, where human and machine find ways of working together to improve production performance. Facing this perspective, one challenge is a growing need for novel lifelong learning initiatives, to meet emerging and altering occupations for the fulfilment of future skill requirements. This challenge is addressed here by portraying a case where three Swedish universities have formed a distinctive collaboration to develop a flexible (i.e. blended) course for professionals, in the subject of Digitally-enabled production. The purpose is to develop a sustainable collaboration between the universities and create a course format on master level addressing lifelong learning for the increasingly digitalized production. The ambition is to increase the impact of the universities respective efforts by sharing resources and utilizing individual specialized expertise to develop a practical and relevant course that can reach a larger target group. The course encompasses industry 4.0 readiness on three levels of production systems; plant-, production cell-, and component level; to adopt a holistic view of digitalization in production. We followed an action research approach for continuously collecting and documenting our experiences during the course development, implementation, and dissemination of the course. Within the frame of action research, an explorative case study describes and analyzes the initiative. The results highlight challenges and opportunities for succeeding with this form of co-produced course. The joint course gives professionals possibilities to work on cases from their own companies with expert supervision from three manufacturing levels to address complex challenges in industry 4.0 implementation. To conclude, the importance of lifelong learning in relation to the human-centric approach of industry 5.0 is emphasized as a future direction.

AB  - Industrial civilization transforms current cutting edge technologies and the evolution of Industry 5.0 is more aggressive with the use of IoT-enabled smart machines and robots in the manufacturing sector today. IoT technology deals with digital data as in additive manufacturing (AM). The potential and progressive aspects of AM embarks for functional part development instead of initial prototyping. AM is one of large-scale production with less buy-to-fly (BTF) ratio. In the present work, a novel framework has been proposed and utilized to attain adaptive bead modeling and an appropriate path plan for enhanced deposition and surface quality of weld beads. Further, the influence of input process parameters toward sustainable wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is also focused. Machine learning-based hybrid-TLBO (h-TLBO) and support vector machine (SVM) is deployed for the optimization process. With the aid of graph theory, weights are estimated for h-TLBO. The overall process parameters and entire data module is handled with IoT technology and can be accessed for processing. The simulated post-processing results are validated experimental test results and found to be in good concurrence.

AB  - The industry is a key driver of economic development. However, changes caused by introduction of modern technologies, and increasing complexity of products and production, directly affect the industrial enterprises and workers. The critics of the Industry 4.0 paradigm emphasized its orientation to new technologies and digitalization in a technocratic way. Therefore, the new industrial paradigm Industry 5.0 appeared very soon and automatically triggered a debate about the role of, and reasons for applying, the new paradigm. Industry 5.0 is complementing the existing Industry 4.0 paradigm with the orientation to the worker who has an important role in the production process, and that role has been emphasized during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this research, there is a brief discussion on main drivers and enablers for introduction of these new paradigms, then a literature-based analysis is carried out to highlight the differences between two paradigms from three important aspects—people, organization, and technology. The conclusion emphasizes the main features and concerns regarding the movement towards Industry 5.0, and the general conclusion is that there is a significant change of the main research aims from sustainability towards human-centricity. At the end, the analysis of maturity models that evaluates enterprises’ readiness to introduce features of new paradigms is given as well.

AB  - According to the Industry 5.0 framework, the smart factory should combine digitalization and prediction activities with a greater sustainability and human centrality within working processes. Indeed, the optimization and improvement of the manufacturing processes have to meet cost criteria related to energy consumption, safety, and implementation of new technologies. The development of better and more advanced technologies boosts Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) in the manufacturing processes. However, due to the high number of safety standards about collaborative robotics and the absence of tools and specific design approaches, collaborative robots (cobots) are still widely adopted as traditional industrial robots wasting the huge potential of a properly Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC). The layout designing is a crucial activity in achieving a proper and effective HRC. This work illustrates how to transfer standard-compliant layout solutions towards an interactive three-dimensional (3D) visualization environment in order to enable the digital prototyping of HRC workplaces. The possibility to automatically generate and visualize multiple layout solutions of collaborative workplaces, and then, to simulate the interaction between human and robot, represents one of the most significant tasks during the designing process. HRC workplace layout is designed according to an optimization criterion, by using the full integration of a numerical computing platform with an interactive 3D visualization environment. Then, by means of the variation of the input parameters, the visualization of new layout solutions is enabled in a fast and effective way.

AB  - In the last few decades, there has been a growing necessity for systems that handle market changes and personalized customer needs with near mass production efficiency, defined as the new mass customization paradigm. The Industry 5.0 vision further enhances the human-centricity aspect, in the necessity for manufacturing systems to cooperate with workers, taking advantage of their problem-solving capabilities, creativity, and expertise of the manufacturing process. A solution is to develop a flexible manufacturing system capable of handling different customer requests and real-time decisions from operators. This paper tackles these aspects by proposing a digital twin of a robotic system for solution preparation capable of making real-time scheduling decisions and forecasts using a simulation model while allowing human interventions. A discrete event simulation model was used to forecast possible system improvements. The simulation handles real-time scheduling considering the possibility of adding identical parallel machines. Results show that processing multiple jobs simultaneously with more than one machine on critical processes, increasing the robot speed, and using heuristics that emphasize the shortest transportation time can reduce the overall completion time by 82%. The simulation model has an animated visualization window for a deeper understanding of the system.

AB  - Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a cost-effective method to support the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and is an enabling technology for Industry 5.0. The use of RFID is particularly suited to IIoT as it does not require a line of sight for communication and can be retroactively affixed to non-smart items. However, RFID communication is affected by the properties of the material the tag is affixed to, specifically the material permittivity. Metal is commonly present in smart factory environments and supply chains and impedes RFID communication. A suitable tag design is required to accommodate these challenges and ensure resilience for Industry 5.0 applications. The research presented in this paper has assessed the communication performance of RFID antenna designs with and without metal present beneath the tag. The RFID tag designs that performed reliably in the simulation were manufactured, and their read range was tested on materials of varying relative permittivity and thickness to represent MP and NMP scenarios. The results have verified the robustness of “Cyber” to “Physical” designs and provide recommendations to support practitioner IIoT tag selection.

AB  - In the context of the Industry 4.0 approach, applications and solutions supporting monitoring, simulation, optimisation and decision-making in production systems are exponentially growing. These solutions are commonly built on digital twins, i.e., comprehensive, structured and effective digital representations of the production system and its entities, whose current status is constantly updated by the plugged data sources. The arising of the Industry 5.0 paradigm and the established key role of workers in manufacturing require new Digital Twins to represent also humans. In fact, as cognitive automation becomes more and more pervasive and its behaviour unintelligible to humans, it becomes essential for improving performance and well-being, at the same time, to model humans as data-driven agents and to represent their interaction with the factory systems. Currently, a standardised solution for creating Digital Twins is missing, forcing industrial solution architects to resort to ad-hoc implementations and models. These solutions lack re-usability, scalability and extensibility, preventing the introduction of a human digital representation in existent twins, so hindering the complete shift to the new Industry 5.0 paradigm. In this paper, such limitations are faced by introducing an extensible and flexible IIoT-industrial internet of things-based platform with a twofold benefit: on the one hand, to support the creation of customised data representations of production systems and their entities including humans; on the other hand, to provide a modular infrastructure, along with its interchangeable components, for easy digital twin instantiation and ramp-up. An implementation of the platform has been tested with different applications in a laboratory setting and released as a public resource. Finally, potential future applications of the proposed digital twin are discussed, highlighting its main benefits.

AB  - Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is the concrete practice of sustainable development at the enterprise level, emphasizing the human value in the production process. The proposal of Industry 5.0 begins to take the coordinated development between human and various production factors as one of the key points of corporate sustainable management. Therefore, this paper studies the optimization of medical enterprise’s operations management considering enterprise CSR under Industry 5.0. A mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is developed to maximize the CSR with the consideration of the impact of precision medical technologies such as surgical robots (SRs) and 3D bone printing on employee social welfare, corporate profits, social environment, and customer surplus value. An improved variable neighborhood tabu search (IVNTS) algorithm which combines the variable neighborhood tabu search (VNTS) algorithm and simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is designed to solve the model, and numerical experiments are analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed IVNTS. The research aids medical enterprise to make reasonable operations management decisions, while providing a reference for the government to draft and implement related policies, thereby achieving sustainable social development.

AB  - Zero defect manufacturing (ZDM) aims at eliminating defects throughout the value stream as well as the cost of rework and scrap. The ambitious goal of zero defects requires the extensive utilization of emerging technologies. Amidst the major drive for technological advancement, humans are often kept out of the loop because they are perceived as the root cause of error. The report from the European Commission on Industry 5.0 emphasizes that human-centric is a key pillar in building a more resilient industry and is vital to incorporate the human component into the manufacturing sector. However, we did not find any publications that explain what human-centric ZDM is, nor what the roles of humans are in advancing ZDM. As a contribution to bridging this gap, a systematic literature review is conducted using different databases. We collected 36 publications and categorised them into 3 different human roles which are managers, engineers, and operators. From our search, we found out that managers play a vital role in cultivating ZDM in the entire organization to prevent errors despite the fact they often do not have direct contact with the production line as operators. Operators can help advance ZDM through knowledge capturing with feedback functions to the engineer to better design a corrective action to prevent errors. Assistive technologies such as extended reality are efficient tools used by operators to eliminate human errors in production environments. Human-centric is now a goal in the future manufacturing sector, but it could face barriers such as high technological investments and resistance to changes in their work tasks. This paper can contribute to paving the roadmap of human-centric ZDM to bring defects to zero and reposition the manufacturing sector to become more resilient.

AB  - The presented article points to the combination of mixed reality with advanced robotics and manipulators. It is a current trend and synonymous with the word industry 5.0, where human-machine interaction is an important element. This element is collaborative robots in cooperation with intelligent smart glasses. In the article, we gradually defined the basic elements of the investigated system. We showed how to operate them to control a collaborative robot online and offline using mixed reality. We pointed out the software and hardware side of a specific design. In the practical part, we provided illustrative examples of a robotic workplace, which was displayed using smart glasses Microsoft HoloLens 2. In conclusion, we can say that the current trends in industry 4.0 significantly affect and accelerate activities in manufacturing companies. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare for the arrival of Industry 5.0, which will focus primarily on collaborative robotics.

AB  - Recent trends towards Industry 5.0 focus on a sustainable and resilient industry, aiming to make technology and innovation more focused on humans and today’s societal concerns. Consequently, this trend also leads to more sustainable and resilient manufacturing, for which collaborative networks play a main role due to the needed involvement of multiple players, being important to consider a perspective of co-responsibility. Establishing adequate performance indicators to assess how collaborative manufacturing ecosystems can support sustainability is thus relevant. Furthermore, this work also analyses how such performance indicators can be used as an influencing factor contributing to improving the players’ behaviour, representing the idea of co-responsibility for a more sustainable manufacturing network. This article proposes a set of performance indicators and a related simulation model to set up several scenarios to analyse how collaboration can influence sustainability in horizontal manufacturing networks. Results from simulation scenarios are included and discussed.

AB  - Quadruple and Quintuple Helix innovation systems are based on democracy and ecology. Two propositions are here key: (1) without a democracy or knowledge democracy, the further advancement of knowledge and innovation are seriously constrained, so in that sense, knowledge and innovation evolution depend on democracy and knowledge democracy; (2) ecology and environmental protection represent a necessity and challenge for humanity, but they also act as drivers for further knowledge and innovation (this should lead to a win–win situation for ecology and innovation). Therefore, for an innovation system to be a Quadruple/Quintuple Helix innovation system, the political regime hosting these helixes needs to be democratic in essence, not just in form. The next stage in evolution of innovation systems may be that this also will require a “democracy of climate” (promoting a social, cultural, economic, and political “climate for democracy”), where democracies as innovation enablers are creating innovation that regard the ecology as a crucial driver for further innovation and for responsible innovation.

AB  - Developing technologies, advancement in science, evolving globalized perspectives and the massive dependence on digital platform for a routine sustenance has led to the core building of Industry 4.0. In general, industry 4.0 focuses on the metamorphosis of all industrial components with the help of strong digital support. It's very often interlinked with the successful fourth industrial revolution. It is to be noted that the very fourth outburst of industrialization plunges forward in order to achieve an optimized and sustained form of production. With the uplift of the fourth generation of this stirring revolution, the efficient extraction of advanced informatics analytics along with internetworked machines have grown to a great extent, complementing the digital platform. On the other hand, society 5.0 involves a human centric community which is capable of striking a balance between the economical proliferations and resolving societal liabilities by the core combination of cyber and physical space. Just like how industry 4.0 carries out the digital transformation of every industrial perspective, society 5.0 encourages mundane life to leap towards a digital revamp expanding across different tiers of the community. Indeed, the rapid change of information and Communication Technology along with the portrayal of society 5.0 as a global trend and a key aspect of the Science and Technology Basic plan, the interplay of the two proves to be a constant support for each other. This paper discusses about the future look of industry 4.0 and society 5.0 and elaborates on the challenges and opportunities rooted from them.

AB  - Big Data, the Internet of Things, and robotic and augmented realities are just some of the technologies that belong to Industry 4.0. These technologies improve working conditions and increase productivity and the quality of industry production. However, they can also improve life and society as a whole. A new perspective is oriented towards social well-being and it is called Society 5.0. Industry 4.0 supports the transition to the new society, but other drivers are also needed. To guide the transition, it is necessary to identify the enabling factors that integrate Industry 4.0. A conceptual framework was developed in which these factors were identified through a literature review and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) methodology. Furthermore, the way in which they relate was evaluated with the help of the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) methodology. The proposed framework fills a research gap, which has not yet consolidated a strategy that includes all aspects of Society 5.0. As a result, the main driver, in addition to technology, is international politics.

AB  - The Japanese demography is drastically changing. It has seen a rapid increase in the elderly population and a decrease in the birth rate. This caused Japan to be a hyper-ageing society. Japanese’s first Baby-boomers who were born in 1947-1949 are now entering old age. Elderly care is a major problem in Japan. Children and care-workers for elderly parents are scarce. Therefore, the second Baby-boomers (born in 1971-1974) aged 40-50 years old have quit working to care for their elderly parents. This situation is known as ‘kaigo rishoku.’ This study looked into the practice of elderly care in Japanese 5.0 Society. Society 5.0 is a concept developed by Japan. It is human-centred and technology-based. In society 5.0, robots and the internet play an essential role in human life. Therefore, we proposed a critical question: Can robots replace humans to care for the elderly in Society 5.0? This study used the qualitative method with a phenomenological approach and descriptive analysis. The results revealed that although robots can assist elderly care, due to the high cost, only a certain elderly can buy them. Therefore, in order for robots to become caregivers of the future, mass production is needed. Thus, robots can be marketed at relatively lower prices. However, sick elderly who live alone still need human assistance. On the one hand, technology helps human life in Society 5.0. On the other hand, the human touch is still necessary for elderly care.

AB  - The industrial revolution 4.0 presents challenges that must be faced by the business world, namely the lack of adequate HR (Human Resource) skills, the problem of security of communication technology, the reliability of the stability of production machines, the inability to change by stakeholders, and the number of job losses due to automation. Society 5.0 offers a human-centered society that makes a balance between economic progress and the resolution of social problems through a system that is highly connected through cyberspace and the real world. If society 4.0 allows anyone to access also share information on the internet. Society 5.0 is an era where all technology is part of humanity itself. To take advantage of opportunities and answer the challenges of the industrial revolution 4.0, Indonesian people in particular are required to have data, technology and human literacy capabilities. Data literacy is needed by HR to improve skills in processing and analyzing big data for the benefit of improving public and business services. Technology literacy shows the ability to utilize digital technology to process data and information, while human literacy must be mastered because it shows the element of soft skills or the development of individual character to be able to collaborate, be adaptive, and innovative. Indonesia is demanded to be able to follow industry 4.0 workflows juxtaposed with society 5.0. The need for human resources in several business fields is still very massive if all of them are carried out by robotics. Indonesia is a developing country with a fairly dense population that is certainly able to align between the needs of industry 4.0 and society 5.0. Leadership in organizations must stay alive so that every innovative competitive strategy is able to run with the existing vision. To go to the era of society 5.0 the government is obliged to continuously control it.

AB  - Deep natural language processing is an algorithmic approach that enables computers to understand language using patterns, purpose, adequate experience, and a natural human data extraction context. It goes beyond a strategy for syntax and depends on a semantic strategy. Industry 5.0 democratizes the co-production of information from Big Data, building on the current symmetrical innovation concept. The Industrial Revolution 5.0 is transforming companies into working through human and computer cooperation with the massive amount of data. Industry 5.0 develops human expertise and accuracy of the computer and will be creative and satisfy consumer needs with the final product. Big data produces usable data and analyzes the best data suited for the good of the industry. The industry has no benefit from NLP converted knowledge without Big Data. Currently, users can get information from several Web sites and do not have enough time to scan all Web sites. Data is distributed with various forms of data such as education, cinema, and politics. Numerous Web sites and social media (WhatsApp, Twitter, etc.) data are distributed in the world. These different data are collected via social media and stored in one SoloDB database that allows the user to access it quickly and easily. With the authorization of the administrative process, the database information can be accessed. Deep natural language, Big Data, and artificial intelligence will be discussed, and the results will be evaluated using the Industry 5.0 private database. The combination of computer and person would make it easy to access information from the database in a customized manner.

AB  - The manufacturing industry has undergone numerous revolutions over the years, with a unanimous acceptance of the greater benefits of being sustainable. The present industrial wave—Industry 4.0—by using its enabling technologies and principles holds great potential to develop sustainable manufacturing paradigms which require balancing out the three fundamental elements —products, processes, and systems. Yet, numerous stakeholders, including industrial policy and decision makers, remain oblivious of such potential and requirements. Thus, this bibliometric study is aimed at presenting an overview of the broad field of research on the convergence of sustainable manufacturing and Industry 4.0 under the umbrella of “Sustainable Manufacturing 4.0”, which has yet to be developed. It includes the dissemination of original findings on pathways and practices of Industry 4.0 applied to the development of sustainable manufacturing, contributing a bibliometric structure of the literature on the aforementioned convergence to reveal how Industry 4.0 could be used to shift the manufacturing sector to a more sustainable-based state. An initial research agenda for this emerging area has accordingly been presented, which may pave the way for having a futuristic view on Sustainable Manufacturing 5.0 in the next industrial wave, i.e., Industry 5.0.

AB  - There is a lack of a single architecture specification that addresses the needs of trusted and secure Artificial Intelligence systems with humans in the loop, such as human-centered manufacturing systems at the core of the evolution towards Industry 5.0. To realize this, we propose an architecture that integrates forecasts, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, supports collecting users’ feedback and uses Active Learning and Simulated Reality to enhance forecasts and provide decision-making recommendations. The architecture security is addressed at all levels. We align the proposed architecture with the Big Data Value Association Reference Architecture Model. We tailor it for the domain of demand forecasting and validate it on a real-world case study.

AB  - Industry 5.0 is regarded as the next industrial evolution which is still on its infancy stage and under investigation phenomena. How shared economy can perform a superlative role in augmenting the corporate sustainable performance is another interesting gap that needs to be unveiled. This study investigates the linkage between shared economy practices and corporate triple bottom line (TBL) in three core streams—environmental performance (ENVP), social performance (SP), and economic performance (EP)—using empirical data. An additional factor of industry 5.0 (i5.0) technologies was treated as a moderator between shared economy and TBL. The findings assured the positive nexus of shared economy (i.e., contract manufacturing services, professional services, data entry & clerical services, creative and multimedia services, sales and marketing services, software development services, and writing or translation services) on TBL (i.e., ENVP, SP, and EP). The positive moderating influence of i5.0 technologies was further affirmed between the relationships of shared economy and TBL. The findings yield multidimensional insights for operational management to adopt shared economy and i5.0 practices to improve corporate TBL in today’s competitive era. In addition, this study accentuates the notion of shared economy by providing positive evidence from developing nations. The study also highlights insightful implications for managers along with future avenues for the researchers to conduct additional multi-directional studies worldwide.

AB  - Data transmission for the industrial Internet of Things (IoT) is crucial for industrial production, especially in the Industry 5.0 era, where humanmachine collaboration is increasingly intensive. To ensure the continuity and robustness of industrial IoT communications in the case of damaged infrastructure communication facilities postdisaster, the industrial IoT can be connected with satellite networks in emergencies. This article presents a cross-regional, end-to-end, transmission control scheme for satellite-supported, multihop industrial IoT. The proposed scheme adjusts the window of data transmission from two phases, slow start and congestion avoidance, to accommodate the low-transmission performance caused by a long delay and high bit error rate in converged networks. The window of data transmission is also adjusted to increase the amount of data transmission for the slow start to fill the high bandwidth-delay product of the converged network, while adjusting the threshold of data transmission based on feedback information to distinguish different data losses during congestion avoidance. The feasibility of the heterogeneous network transmission model is experimentally verified. The results show that the scheme can achieve good performance in heterogeneous networks of industrial IoT and satellite networks. The scheme is effective in ensuring the continuity and stability of intelligent machine production in Industry 5.0 in emergency communication cases.

AB  - Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) paves way into Industry 5.0, which incorporates humanmachine collaboration, thereby making manufacturing industry efficient. As 5G architecture supports massive IoT connectivity and has higher spectrum efficiency, device-to-device (D2D) communication is favorable at 28 GHz. While transmitting data from sensors to end user through IoT network, interference affects the system. Thus, an efficient resource allocation scheme is needed for minimizing interference and increasing data rate. Here, formulated problem is divided into two subproblems, channel assignment and power optimization in order to lower computational complexity. A partial resource multiplexing scheme is proposed that will allocate channels to available D2D users. Later, power optimization problem is formulated which is determined through Lagrangian dual optimization technique. Dynamic sectorization overcomes issue of increase in user traffic. Stability factor, fairness index (FI), and energy efficiency depict the performance superiority of proposed scheme over existing schemes. Simulation results prove efficacy of proposed system.

AB  - The introduction of collaborative robots aims to make production more flexible, promoting a greater interaction between humans and robots also from physical point of view. However, working closely with a robot may lead to the creation of stressful situations for the operator, which can negatively affect task performance. In Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), robots are expected to be socially intelligent, that is, capable of understanding and reacting accordingly to human social and affective clues. This ability can be exploited implementing affective computing, which concerns the development of systems able to recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affects. Social intelligence is essential for robots to establish a natural interaction with people in several contexts, including the manufacturing sector with the emergence of Industry 5.0. In order to take full advantage of the human-robot collaboration, the robotic system should be able to perceive the psycho-emotional and mental state of the operator through different sensing modalities (e.g. facial expressions, body language, voice, or physiological signals) and to adapt its behavior accordingly. The development of socially intelligent collaborative robots in the manufacturing sector can lead to a symbiotic human-robot collaboration, arising several research challenges that still need to be addressed. The goals of this paper are the following: (i) providing an overview of affective computing implementation in HRI; (ii) analyzing the state-of-art on this topic in different application contexts (e.g. healthcare, service applications, and manufacturing); (iii) highlighting research challenges for the manufacturing sector.

AB  - While pre-fifth and fifth generation networks have been designed mainly to support machine-to-machine and human-to-human communications via data, audio, and video communications, a major thrust of beyond fifth generation Networks is the abutment of human-to-machine/robot (H2M/R) collaboration. Such collaborations are deeply anchored in the vision of Society 5.0, which promotes a human-centered society that integrates virtual and physical real spaces to resolve social problems, and Industry 5.0, which promotes intelligent manufacturing processes through collaboration between humans and cyber-physical systems. It is expected that real-time H2M/R collaborations will drive new technologies that facilitate the low-latency exchange of control signals and haptic feedback between humans and machines/robots. The low-latency constraints for real-time interaction will, however, place limits on deployable distance and the flexibility of adding new machines/robots to the system. The scalability of H2M/R collaborations across large geographical distances that also allow rapid onboarding of new machines/robots is therefore an open challenge. This article focuses on global-local AI coordinated learning (GLAD), a solution framework that supports the dynamic addition of new machines/robots and their rapid onboarding. The GLAD framework is based on learning the traffic characteristics and correlation of supported robots/machines at the local edge and global cloud. Harnessing data samples from a real H2M/R application for training and validation, GLAD enables human operators to remotely control machines/robots over extended distances through accurately forecasting their haptic feedback. By globally coordinating and sharing this learning across the network, up to 72 percent of the time can be saved when onboarding new machines/robots.

AB  - Benefiting from the marriage of just-in-time (JIT) and computer integrated manufacturing (CIM), a series of manufacturing planning and control (MPC) systems has been introduced for contemporary production and operations management. However, the increasing requirements for customized and personalized products and services, together with the acceleration of the socio-economic environment in the age of Industry 4.0, forced manufacturers to re-evaluate their current MPC strategies that mainly emphasize time, cost and quality priorities. Industry 4.0 presents a solid ambition for transforming to a digital, data-driven and interconnected manufacturing industry centred around cyber-physical convergence. Although the relevance of Industry 4.0 technologies’ disruptions on operations management has been acknowledged, a significant gap in the evolution of the logic and design of MPC systems has been observed. The requirements of on-demand products and services with enhanced flexibility, resilience, sustainability and humanitarianism in this new industrial revolution call for innovations of MPC architectures and approaches. This paper first summarizes the evolution of MPC systems with enabling technologies and the changing business climate at that time. To explore innovative MPC that complies with the increasing economic, social and environmental requirements, the concept of synchronization-oriented MPC with four principles is proposed. Following the principles, a general framework for the synchronization-oriented MPC with enhanced economic, social and environmental benefits is developed. This work potentially provides insights into innovative MPC in the age of Industry 4.0 and even Industry 5.0.

AB  - Moving towards Industry 5.0, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has become an indispensable role. IIoT devices could help manufacturing companies to observe various production statuses hence improving production efficiency. However, its limitation on resources and features makes robust security implementation a big challenge. Implementing a secure, general and scalable system to adopt across industries is one of the most critical topics for IIoT. This paper proposed a blockchain-based system architecture to auto-update, monitor, and fix the IIoT devices' software. We take the software status snapshots and store them as a blockchain ledger to protect the software's integrity and the software from unauthorized modification. To achieve auto-update and auto fix, we also simulate the concept of a blockchain contract to create the ledger whenever there are changes. As a result, the changes could continuously be tracked. The performance and scalability are also evaluated. The result shows that the system could also be deployed in larger-scale IIoT devices. The software update and fix could be guaranteed authenticated, and the unauthorized software could be monitored and detected.

AB  - Fish constitute important high protein products to meet the demands of an increasing global population. However, the continued depletion of wild fish stocks is leading to increased strain on the aquaculture sector in terms of sustaining the supply of fish and seafood to global markets. Despite the fact that aquaculture is more diversified than other agriculture sectors, there are significant pressures on the industry to continue innovating in order to enable sustainability including increased fish production, improved appropriate selection of species, disease mitigation, reduced wastage, preventing environmental pollution and generating more employment globally. This viewpoint article addresses how digital transformation can help support and meet expansion needs of the fisheries/aquaculture industries that includes exploiting and harnessing ICT, IoT, Cloud-edge computing, AI, machine learning, immersive technologies and blockchain. Digital technologies are bringing significant operational benefits for global food chain, improving efficiencies and productivity, reducing waste, contamination and food fraud. The focus on digital technologies has recently evolved to Industry 5.0 where AI and robotics are coupled with the human mind in order to advance human-centric solutions. This viewpoint describes the role of Quadruple helix Hub (academic-industry-government and society) in delivering a convergent holistic approach to meeting the diversity of fishery industry needs by connecting and placing fisheries centrally in a defined ecosystem of stakeholders. This includes specialist training, testing technologies, providing access to finance and fostering disruption through aquaculture accelerator initiatives such as that provided by Hatch Blue. Connecting digital Innovation Hubs trans-regionally, nationally and internationally will also help mitigate against significant risks for the fisheries and aquaculture industry including climate change, global pandemics and conflicts that can jeopardize fish and seafood production and supply chains. There is also a commensurate need to avail of digital technologies in order to increase awareness of key industry issues across the value chain, such as through social marketing. Thus, addressing key challenges by way of the global digital transformation of fishery and aquaculture industry will meet several sustainable development goals of the United Nations catered around the application of disruptive technology.

AB  - Industrial process automation is becoming more advance due to the new technological revolutions like Industrial Internet of things (IIoT), Machine to Machine Communication (M2M), cloud computing, cognitive computing, artificial intelligence, and big little multicore-based ARM processors for embedded applications. Modern IP-enabled sensors, actuators, and controllers are transforming industrial automation into industry 5.0 compliances to attain full autonomy with minimal human intervention. With these emerging technologies, Smart Cyber-Physical System (SCPS) is the most important part of the fourth industrial revolution, where diffident programmed embedded systems are networked together to perform, computation, communication, control, and actuation. In this paper, we proposed a heterogeneous architecture for SCPS, where different electrical, pneumatic, and hydraulic processes can be integrated to execute hybrid process dynamics. The proposed architecture is enabled to separate all aspects like computation, control, communication, and actuation, of a process dynamic by estimating the process disturbances, sensor delay, actuator delay, and conversion delay. The allotment of computational embedded cores to different physical processes is done through voltage frequency islands (VFI) with high modularity which is different for different processes. All the mapped process dynamics are optimized through Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS). The best implementation of the proposed architecture is the upcoming era of industry 5.0 where human intervention is also in a fold in various industries like petroleum, fertilizer, paper, cement, space exploration, and automobile manufacturing.

AB  - In the context of factory digitization, the focus of Industry 4.0 initiative is to leverage the automation and data exchange in manufacturing processes using automation, IoT, and advanced technologies. Industry 5.0 has emerged as the next industrial revolution, to adopt a human-centric approach for digital technologies. That said, having people, robots, smart machines, and intelligent production systems working together raises challenges in terms of monitoring and securing the production environment. In other words, the complexity of smart factories makes it possible for incidents to occur and interrupt the manufacturing process. They might also cause leaking sensitive information or putting the worker’s life in danger as well. Accordingly, designing secure architectures in intelligent factories is crucial to secure a continuous production lifecycle and safe working conditions. Nonetheless, due to the decentralized environment of modern factories, creating multi-domain data correlation is crucial to obtain universal monitoring of the occurring events, as well as to establish cyber situational awareness and adopt suitable countermeasures in case of attacks. For these purposes, we developed a holistic multi-domain security and safety mechanism for Factories of the Future. Our approach consists of individual but integrated modules, each of which is responsible for capturing alerts from different domains of the factory. Alerts are then handled by an intelligent correlator to inspect possible attacks or malfunctions on the investigated shop floor. In this paper, we describe the architecture and design of the developed approach.

AB  - For many applications deployed in manufacturing networks, communication latency has been a significant barrier. Despite the constant development of improved communication protocols and standards during Industry 4.0, the latency problem persists, lowering quality of services (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE). Tactile internet (TI), with its high availability, security, and ultra-low latency, will add a new dimension to human-machine interaction (HMI) by enabling haptic and tactile sensations. The tactile internet (TI) is a cutting-edge technology that uses 5G and beyond (B5G) communications to enable real-time interaction of haptic data over the internet between tactile ends. This emerging TI technology is regarded as the next evolutionary step for the Internet of Things (IoT) and is expected to bring about massive changes towards Society 5.0 and to address complex issues in current society. To that end, the 5G mobile communication systems will support the TI at the wireless edge. As a result, TI can be used as a backbone for delay mitigation in conjunction with 5G networks, allowing for ultra-reliable low latency applications like Smart Manufacturing, virtual reality, and augmented reality. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to present the current state of 5G and TI, as well as the challenges and future trends for 5G networks beyond 2021, as well as a conceptual framework for integrating 5G and TI into existing industrial case studies, with a focus on the design aspects and layers of TI, such as the master, network, and slave layers.

AB  - Abstract
In today’s modern world, societies are utterly attached to internet and technologies to access more information, switching the traditional modes of communication to virtual – all at large scale simultaneously. Governments are using advanced innovative technologies to provide end-to-end integrated public services e.g. in the form of electronic government (e-Government); nevertheless, how effective and efficient their communication with public society are and where citizens engagement has been considered to deliver the services – these still remain unexplored. This developing paper is considering Industry 4.0 (I4.0), Society 5.0 (S5.0), sustainability and circular economy in order to review the impact of I4.0 on manufacturing, what various governments planned to adopt I4.0 technologies within public services and direct communication with citizens. Eventually introducing some of the opportunities, challenges and gaps within citizen’s electronic engagement (e-Engagement) which is a term of digital communication between citizens and public decision makers.

AB  - Recent technological advances encompassed by the smart factory concept have fundamentally changed industrial control systems in the way they are structured and how they operate. Majority of these changes affect Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, shifting them to a higher level of interoperability, heterogeneous networks, big data and toward internet technologies and services in general. However, this transformation does not affect all SCADA systems equally. The immediate industrial environment and controlled processes have a significant impact as well. This paper presents a holistic approach to SCADA systems implemented in continuous flow production control within the steel industry production environment. We outline the multi-layer architecture of the SCADA control framework and the aspects of interoperability and interconnectivity within the architecture reference models, together with the research challenges and opportunities arising from the recent rapid increasement of the industrial control systems complexity and digital transformation under the Industry 4.0 paradigm, resulting in disrupting levels of the traditional automation pyramid based on Purdue model toward a higher level of integration and interoperability enabling cross-level data exchange empowered by the Industrial Internet of Things. Furthermore, the paper addresses the problem of proprietary SCADA systems and elaborates the causal correlation between SCADA quality requirements and adoption of new technologies in relation to the specific industrial environment of the steel manufacturing process.

AB  - The future of industry 4.0 which is called industry 5.0 is the crossroads between information technology and operational technology, converging on physical and virtual systems that were previously used separately in industrial manufacturing processes with a focus of western culture. In other words, the supply chain uses technology to create integration between people, processes, and products. SMEs owners, manufacturers, and service organizations can access unprecedented, new levels of data, which can make it easy to understand, control, and improve every aspect of their operations. In the present study, existing research work on the models and assessment readiness criteria for the adoption of industry 4.0 are over-viewed. In I4.0, hybrid organizations are a type of organizations that have two wings of social and environmental mission and economic wing. The business models of these organizations have blurred the line between for-profit and non-profit organizations so that hybrid organizations can fall into both for-profit / non-profit categories. Hybrid Entrepreneurs Seek Organizational Organizations and Markets to Address Specific Social and Environmental Issues. The characteristics of these organizations are creating value for healthy living, environmental and social justice, environmental sustainability, quality products and services. In this paper we did research the development of a readiness assessment framework for tomorrow’s SMEs/hybrid SMEs or SME 5.0 which are small medium sized enterprises for getting prepared for the future concern for adopting the educational components of future of I4.0.

AB  - The outbreak of the COVID pandemic revealed that supply chains are not resilient to such a type of turmoil, and the food industry appeared to be particularly vulnerable. Meanwhile, customers expect uninterrupted deliveries and the products' selection responding to their preferences. In the article, we discuss several topics related to supply management that allow preparing a delivery plan for a distributed network of vending machines, considering each location individually. The developed solution takes advantage of the state-of-the-art machine learning methods. However, it is human-centric and aligned with the concept of Industry 5.0. We present the conceptual and technological side of the solution with a particular emphasis on the developed feature extraction framework, which uses selected indicators from the survival analysis. We present an analysis of the real data confirming that the proposed approach copes well with high uncertainty in data, addressing the cold-start problem.

AB  - We developed anew spatial autoregressive stochastic frontier model for the panel data.The main feature of this frontier model is aspatial lag term of the explained variables, ajoint structure of aproduction possibility frontier with amodel of technical inefficiency.This model addresses the spatial interdependence, the heteroskedastic technical inefficiency.This study applies the maximum likelihood methods by considering the endogenous spatial lag term.The proposed model nests many existing models. Further, an empirical analysis using data on the Japanese manufacturing industry is conducted, the existing models are tested against the proposed model, which is found to be statistically supported.The findings suggest that estimates in the existing spatial, non-spatial models may exhibit bias because of lack of determinants of technical inefficiency, as well as aspatial lag.This bias also affects the technical efficiency score, its ranking.Our model can analyze industrial policies including industrial cluster policies, also it is expected that, by devising the spatial weight matrix, it will be possible to analyze what kind of industrial agglomeration form is desirable for improving productivity.

AB  - Technological advances have made possible industrial and commercial applications of artificial intelligence, virtual reality and highly integrated manufacturing systems. It has also freed business activity from a focus on place, as both work activities and markets have been able to harness information and communication technologies in order to operate remotely. As a result, researchers have highlighted a phenomenon of ‘smart’ working. Some have pointed to a fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) in which ‘smart’ factories use robotics to achieve high performance. There is now a suggestion of progress towards Industry 5.0, in which technological and social systems work in harmony to deliver personalised mass customization of products and services. This paper examines these developments from the perspective of unique, individual understandings of work roles and sustainability, posing the questions ‘Smart’ from whose point of view? Do smart systems promote sustainable organizations? How should design of smart systems be approached? It suggests that contemporary socio-technical systems approaches to organizational analysis are the best way to support harnessing of smart technologies in organizations.

AB  - The integration of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies within society is pivotal for resolving many challenges that the world and its population are facing presently—global pandemics, ageing populations, and climate change. However, academics and practitioners still struggle to fully understand I4.0 outcomes outside of the manufacturing domain, thereby unravelling their potential for society at large. In this scenario, Society 5.0 (S5.0) is arising as a new paradigm that places humans at the centre of innovation. To foster the effective integration of technology into society and to better understand how to design S5.0 configurations and solutions, the authors developed a conceptual model applying the Design Thinking (DT) approach to the Quintuple Helix (QH) innovation framework. The proposed QH–DT model was found to be suitable for allowing the knowledge flow among the actors involved in the design and implementation of the S5.0 solution. The model was then explained through its application in a healthcare project—the SMARTAGE. By adopting an action research methodology, the results explain how it becomes possible to build complex human-centric healthcare solutions.

AB  - The role of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) in critical infrastructure sectors, such as power, chemistry, and manufacturing, will be increasingly important as we move toward Industry 5.0. For example, IIoT devices are deployed in factories to help the manufacturing companies (e.g., automotive) gain in-depth insight into the various states of production, and thus improving production efficiency and achieving cost reductions. However, malicious code may compromise IIoT devices if either the devices are exposed to outside or unexposed inner devices are updated unauthentically. Due to their limited resources and features, it is challenging to implement strong security solutions for such embedded devices. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based software status monitoring system, called BoSMoS. The system is designed to monitor the software status of IIoT devices to detect and respond to identified malicious behaviors (e.g., intrusions). BoSMoS takes a snapshot of the statue of monitored software and monitors its file system calls. In order to ensure the software integrity information, we use blockchain as the distributed ledger to store a snapshot of software status. The blockchain network of BoSMoS can employ different consensus algorithms. We also evaluate the performance of BoSMoS, in terms of exception response delay, resistance performance to various intrusions, and scalability. The experimental results justify that BoSMoS is practical and sound. In addition, the evaluation of scalability and security demonstrates that the system can carry deployment of large-scale IIoT devices and can guarantee authenticated software updating, as well as detect unauthorized software status.

AB  - In the recent industrial revolution (Industry 5.0), additive manufacturing (AM) will be a very interesting technology, and it is predicted that it will have a significant impact on a wide range of industries in the near future. AM involves many different processing techniques, such as powder bed fusion, directed energy deposition (DED), sheet lamination, and so on, and it can use many different feedstock materials such as metals, polymers, and ceramics. In this chapter, we focused our attention on laser-based AM techniques used to produce metal parts, specifically in selective laser melting and laser-assisted DED techniques. The chapter begins with a classification of lasers and the interaction of lasers with materials. Furthermore, a comprehensive review on the classification of laser-based AM processes, their working principle, relevance of laser processing, need for postprocessing, and a classification of postprocessing techniques are explained in detail. Finally, it is shown that AM processes must be combined in the near future with all traditional manufacturing technologies; however, laser-based AM techniques have an excellent opportunity to influence the current manufacturing sector.

AB  - methodology of evaluation of efficiency of the implementation at industrial enterprises of “peer-to-peer distributed systems of storage and processing of protected information in enterprise networks” has been proposed. The efficiency evaluation is based on the comparison of the indicators of reliability, fault tolerance, and total cost of ownership of the implementation of corporate information systems within the proposed system and its possible alternatives. The “peer-to-peer distributed system of storage and processing of protected information” is designed for the protection of distributed computing and incapsulation of private networks without restricting possibilities for usable interactions in the process of implementation of Industry 5.0 and Super Smart Society technologies. When these concepts get implemented in an enterprise, manufacture, logistics, and sales are merged into a global geographically and organizationally distributed information system for data exchange, which functions on top of the Internet. The proposed system offers tools for setting up distributed computing, and it ensures an effective response to threats by applying cryptography, unauthorized access protection with the use of biometry and an innovative protocol for information exchange and control of topology powered by distributed ledger technology, while also optimizing the utilization of computing capacity.

AB  - In the futuristic Industry framework, user interactions with the product are seamlessly integrated with the product life cycle which results in Information overload. The shopbots were proposed in Industry 4.0 where the more focus was on process automation. In this research work, we propose recommender system for industry 5.0 which is based on collaboration of human beings and machines with more focus on user’s personalization. Recommender system can be considered as an information filtering tool that provides suggestions to users about products, music, friend, topic, etc. This suggestion is based on the interest of users. Several research works have been carried out to improve recommendation accuracy by using matrix factorization, trust-based, hybrid-based, machine learning, and deep learning techniques. However, very few existing works have leveraged textual opinions for the recommendation to the best of our knowledge. Existing research works have focused only on numerical ratings, which do not reflect actual user behaviour. In this research work, sentiments of textual opinions are analysed for an in-depth analysis of user’s behaviour. Recommendation accuracy is improved by using the proposed score Recop which is calculated from opinion sentiments. Furthermore, the sparsity issue is resolved by using our proposed approach. Amazon and Yelp review datasets are used for Experiment analysis. Mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values are improved significantly using the proposed approach compared to the existing approaches. MAE and RMSE scores on the Yelp dataset are 0.85 and 1.51, respectively. Additionally, MAE and RMSE scores on the Amazon dataset are 0.66 and 0.93, respectively, which clearly reflects the significant contribution of our proposed approach.

AB  - The rise of the fourth industrial revolution aspires to digitize any traditional manufacturing process, paving the way for new organisation schemes and management principles that affect business models, the environment, and services across the entire value chain. During the last two decades, the generated advancements have been analysed and discussed from a bunch of technological and business perspectives gleaned from a variety of academic journals. With the aim to identify the digital footprint of Industry 4.0 in the current manufacturing ecosystem, a systematic literature survey of surveys is conducted here, based on survey academic articles that cover the current state-of-the-art. The 59 selected high-impact survey manuscripts are analysed using PRISMA principles and categorized according to their technologies under analysis and impact, providing valuable insights for the research and business community. Specifically, the influence Industry 4.0 exerts on traditional business models, small and medium-sized enterprises, decision-making processes, human–machine interaction, and circularity affairs are investigated and brought out, while research gaps, business opportunities, and their relevance to Industry 5.0 principles are pointed out.

AB  - Two of the most important enabling Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies are computational simulation (CS) and Digital Twin (DT). Both technologies have myriad applications in fields as diverse as medicine or manufacturing. Although there is still no agreement on the difference between CS and DT, it is being accepted that a CS represents real systems through a computational model, whilst a DT has, in addition, a two-way data communication with the real object and in real time. This work consists of a brief introduction to I4.0, CS and DT and finally a business case, which was carried out on a dairy small and medium enterprise (SME) factory located in Argentina. This company wanted to expand its product portfolio launching two new kinds of cheeses. The production process used to be carried out jointly between machines and operators. The main drawbacks to be solved to have more competitive prices were container filling speed, precision, and labour costs. Because of that, it was proposed the searching of alternative solutions that allow increasing production, reducing the operating times and reduce costs. A CS allowed to select between 7 possible scenarios with different configurations and numbers of operators and collaborative robots.

AB  - Emerging energy systems are inherently different from their conventional counter-parts. To address all issues of these systems, comprehensive approaches of transdisciplinary and post-normal sciences are needed. This article tries to re-conceptualize emerging energy systems using Robert Rosen’s theory of anticipatory system and introduces the concept of the anticipatory smart energy system (ASES). Three important features of an ASES are described and socio-technical considerations for realization of these features are discussed. The article also considers realization of such systems under society 5.0 paradigm and spime techno-culture. In ASESs, the identity of users evolves and new identities are created for energy users, based on the production, consumption, storage, and distributed management of energy. An Anticipatory energy system can manage a common pool of prosumaging.

AB  - Recent advances in materials modelling, characterization and materials informatics suggest that deep integration of such methods can be a crucial aspect of the Industry 5.0 revolution, where the fourth industrial revolution paradigms are combined with the concepts of transition to a sustainable, human-centric and resilient industry. We pose a specific deep integration challenge beyond the ordinary multidisciplinary modelling/characterization research approach in this short communication with research and innovation as drivers for scientific excellence. Full integration can be achieved by developing common ontologies across different domains, enabling meaningful computational and experimental data integration and interoperability. On this basis, fine-tuning of adaptive materials modelling/characterization protocols can be achieved and facilitate computational and experimental efforts. Such interoperable and meaningful data combined with advanced data science tools (including machine learning and artificial intelligence) become a powerful asset for materials scientists to extract complex information from the large amount of data generated by last generation characterization techniques. To achieve this ambitious goal, significant collaborative actions are needed to develop common, usable, and sharable digital tools that allow for effective and efficient twinning of data and workflows across the different materials modelling and characterization domains.

AB  - The application of industry 4.0 has been doing in many countries in the world today even some developed countries have headed to industry 5.0, nevertheless in Indonesia there are still many companies that have not implemented industry 4.0. This research aims to find out the extent of the implementation of industry 4.0 in Indonesia, especially the industry located on the island of Java.The industry 4.0 aspects as a benchmark of differentiator from previous industrial developments is worth scrutinized to know its application levels in the service and manufacturing industries. Although many industries still combine their operating system between the 4.0 industry and conventional operating systems. The population s are the services and manufacturing companies. The data was obtained by using a questionnaire distributed online to respondents with a purposive sampling method. The data was grouped according to The level of implementation and is centered. The calculation and percentage results demonstrate that the level of implementation of the 4.0 industry with a technology base in service companies and manufacturing companies are at a managed level. It illustrates that the companies being researched have not been fully on the demands of the 4.0 industry.

AB  - The biorefinery approach for large-scale biomass utilization involving the co-production of bioethanol and value-added products has received a great deal of attention. A techno-economic evaluation of an innovative integrated biorefinery approach using macroalgae cellulosic residue (MCR) was investigated in the present study for the co-production of bioethanol and L-lactic acid (LLA) via Aspen Plus V10. The simulation resulted in a production capacity capable of producing 3856.8 kg/hr of anhydrous bioethanol, 6488.04 kg/hr of LLA, 4479.48 kg/hr of fertilizer, and 5233.79 kWh of electricity generation from a feedstock of 15883.3 kg/hr of MCR. The yield of products per unit mass of feedstock were 0.24 kg of anhydrous ethanol, 0.41 kg of LLA and 0.28 kg of fertilizer per kg of MCR. The bioethanol product has a purity of 99.7 wt%, while the product purity of LLA is 92.8 wt%. The electricity generated from the combined heat and power (CHP) plant managed to supply up to 70% of the plant's total electricity requirement. The implementation of Heat Exchanger Network (HEN) synthesis successfully generated a total energy savings of 35% through the optimization process. With a plant service year of 20 years, the payback period is 6.25 years, having a Return on investment (ROI) of 30.8%. Furthermore, the plant is equipped with futuristics integration of Industry 5.0, implementing the effort of human-robot interaction to achieve maximum efficiency and productivity.

AB  - Recently, the production organizations and their suppliers have been facing big pressure concerning an increase in their performance, minimization of costs and, finally yet importantly, meeting of their customers’ needs. In order to keep up the pace with the requirements, the production organizations are using various tools and methods of their improvement. Recently, the application of Industry 4.0 elements has become a key tool for them, and they are based on the need of automation application within production processes. Despite that, there are several activities and processes, which cannot be fully replaced with automation elements, and for their functioning, it is necessary to use a human-machine interface. Because of that, the activities and processes present the risks that do not have to be foreseeable in advance and their late identification and management are combined from discordant product generation, which automatically leads to a loss of competitiveness, or drop of the company profit.This article is oriented on the risk analysis as an influence value of non-conformity, which originated by the manual placing of components in the process of production organization operating within the automotive area. Using the quality tools, the causes of the non-conformity origination were identified, and system solutions for its elimination were proposed. In line with the strategy Industry 5.0, training, as well as investment into the operators´ training program, created a part of the latter solutions within the context of a significant influence of human factor in the human-machine system.

AB  - Recently, the concept of Industry 5.0 has been introduced to complement, among other things, Industry 4.0’s focus on efficiency and productivity with a focus on humans in digital design and production processes. The inclusion of human interaction with digital realities, extended reality (XR) technologies, such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), can play an essential role in Industry 5.0. While rapid advances in XR technologies are solidifying and finding their place in the product and production development process, terminology and classification scheme remain under-determined. As a result, there have been numerous classifications of XR technologies from different perspectives, but little widespread agreement. They have been classified by their level of immersion or how well they meet a specific purpose (such as training). In addition to that, the classifications are usually made for one particular field (e.g. marketing, healthcare, engineering, architecture, among others). Therefore, to set the basis for future research, it is essential to identify and outline the dimensions that intervene in product and production design in regards to XR facilitated collaboration. With the ideas proposed in this paper, we want to identify basic concepts that classify a collaborative XR system by analyzing how users interact with the environment and other users. Our motivation is that collaborative design involves not only the physical dimension but also a social dimension. Defining when an XR system contributes to increasing social and/or physical presence could clarify and simplify its categorization.

AB  - It is predicted that the society of 2050 will be characterized by a fourth industrial revolution and the Society 5.0, which will enable us to make "manufacturing" and "human resource development "through a learning environment that transcends time and space and education that crosses academic disciplines. However, the future must not be envisioned without the fact that there are universals between those "things" and "people". In the long history of mankind, we have encountered many catastrophic crises caused by wars, natural disasters, epidemics, and other events, as well as the industrial and economic development caused by revolutionary technological revolutions, but the universality that continues to exist in our societies and lifestyles persists. We will examine the society and lifestyle of 2050 that we are facing and compare the changing "manufacturing" and "human resource development" with the "universality" and try to envision the ideal society and lifestyle of the future.

AB  - Under the background of double carbon target and digital intelligence era, the innovation resources and innovation environment that manufacturing enterprises rely on have shown exponential growth. Digital green innovation (DGI) has gradually become the mainstream paradigm of innovation. How to achieve a balance between a local DGI network (LDGIN) and a remote DGI network (RDGIN) and how to use the role of digital empowerment and green organization flexibility to improve the performance of DGI are very important issues facing manufacturing enterprises at present. However, this problem has not been fully addressed in the existing research. In this study, the influence mechanism of LDGIN and RDGIN on the DGI performance of manufacturing enterprises was revealed, considering the moderating role of digital empowerment and green organization flexibility. The linear regression method was used to analyze the 562 valid data obtained by questionnaire survey. The results of this study are as follows. The effect of the DGI network on manufacturing enterprises’ DGI performance is heterogeneous because of LDGIN and RDGIN. The establishment of embedded links in a DGI network inevitably requires manufacturing enterprises to pay the corresponding costs. The over-embedding of manufacturing enterprises into RDGIN will have a negative impact on DGI performance. The balance between LDGIN and RDGIN has an important impact on manufacturing enterprises’ operation. The comprehensive balance and relative balance indexes constructed in this paper show that an appropriate balance can promote the improvement of the DGI performance of manufacturing enterprises. Digital transformation and organizational structure innovation are changing the business model of manufacturing enterprises and can regulate the relationship between the LDGIN and RDGIN and the DGI performance of manufacturing enterprises. The balance of DGI network embedding in practice shows the important role and enlightening significance of local and remote search in developing countries.

AB  - The article examines the foundations of educational innovations in the Krestovozdvszhensk Labor Brotherhood, which was founded by the famous philosopher, landowner and philanthropist N. N. Neplyuev in the 1880s, 30 km to North of Glukhov. It shows the socio-economic successes that the community could achieve in the production and social spheres. Educational innovations, due to which young brothers were brought up, are characterized: the need for constant practical application of innovative technologies and methods of work, reproduction of motives for self-learning and obtaining new knowledge, conditionality of constant decision-making, self-organization and self-government, etc. Methods of organization, social relations, approach to production activities along which the Brotherhood lived, days with the present. In particular, the focus of the Brotherhood's economy on the use of renewable resources and ensuring the sustainable state of adjacent ecosystems brings it closer to the goals and objectives of the Third Industrial Revolution, which is now taking place in the world. The priority of information production in the Brotherhood and its focus on the mechanization of labor processes make it clearer the logics of the modern Fourth Industrial Revolution clearer. And, finally, the invaluable achievement of the brothers is the priority they have achieved of a human personality development. This is what is now becoming essential in the light of the Fifth Industrial Revolution. It is especially noted that the Brotherhood, thanks to its educational system, managed to create a unique reproductive potential, which included: a system of necessary self-reproduction of human personalities; system of reproduction of the most effective use and reproduction of natural capital; system of reproduction of synergetic combination of human, natural and physical capitals.

AB  - In the context of Industry 5.0, in this article, we study the cyberphysicalsocial systems in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) based on the task background of transmission line project acceptance. First, based on the idea of a parallel system, a parallel UAV planning system for transmission line project acceptance tasks is developed. The mathematical model based on swarm intelligence is then constructed from the multidimensional perspective of improving the acceptance efficiency, shortening the acceptance time, and reducing the energy consumption. This is done based on the physical system data while considering the constraints of UAVs in performing acceptance tasks. Experiments are simulated based on the actual environment data of the quality supervision and acceptance of a 500 kV transmission line project in a plateau area before it is put into production. The obtained results are compared with those of other similar cutting-edge algorithms. The efficiency and practicality of the proposed artificial parallel planning system are finally verified.

AB  - This chapter goes beyond simply defining terms by providing an overview of the entire technology and data ecosystem (within and beyond the food industry) so that readers are able to differentiate between Blockchain, cryptocurrency and ledgers, as well as smart contracts and the cloud. A deep look at disruptive technology and innovation in retail highlights the diversity of the future of food safety technology. Food systems and food supply chains (FSCs) have undergone significant changes in their operations and structure over the last decade as globalization expands both food choice and availability. As FSCs lengthen, and food passes through extended trading relationships, transparency on food origins, methods of cultivation, harvest, processing as well as labor conditions and sustainability are reduced, along with food trust. Moreover, while the rapid pace of technology innovation benefits FSCs, we are witness to the usage of social media platforms by citizen-consumers to amplify the rhetoric related to recurring incidents and crises in food quality, food safety, food fraud, food security, sustainability, and other ethical lapses. Furthermore, we are witness to new evidence on the global burden of foodborne diseases, including noncommunicable diseases that range from severe malnutrition to morbid obesity and from severe illnesses requiring hospitalization to mortality. The World Health Organization claims that 31 foodborne hazards cause 600 million illnesses and 420,000 deaths annually. Overcoming these challenges requires a holistic reframing of our food systems and societal challenges. The emergence of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provides an overarching framework for collaboration and alignment. Japan has put forward a vision for a human-centric, technology-enabled future branded as “Society 5.0.” Increasingly, the redesign of FSCs necessitates a concerted, multistakeholder effort and the development of digitization strategies in order to cope with the evolution toward the vision of Society 5.0 and to achieve the UN SDGs.

AB  - The era of the implementation of Society 5.0 places humans as the main element in the development of life in line with advances in technology and information, especially in achieving SDGs 2030. This encourages humans, especially the millennial generation to act as agents of change whose role is to trigger change. Changes are expected in an era that often occurs with technology. Not technology about personal finance that is investment. Especially during the pandemic, investment is needed by the community to deal with economic instability. However, during the pandemic, investors' interest in investing in the capital market increased because prices decreased. In addition, the main investors are millennials. Awareness of starting investments so that millennials can meet future needs. With millennial awareness to encourage many companies both private and state to carry out digital investments. According to OJK and the Ministry of Finance, before choosing a platform/application, millennials used to understand 2L aspects, namely law and logistics, and 2R aspects, namely return (return) and risk (risk). The method used in writing this work is descriptive qualitative with literature study. By growing awareness of investing in the millennial generation, it is hoped that they can optimize the use of technology as an effort to succeed in the era of Society 5.0. Millenials can invest easily through applications that are provided by the private sector or the government. The products offered also range from gold, mutual funds, bonds to stocks. Implementasi era Society 5.0 menempatkan manusia sebagai elemen utama dalam perkembangan kehidupan yang diiringi dengan kemajuan teknologi dan informasi terutama dalam pencapaian target SDGs 2030. Hal tersebut mendorong manusia khususnya generasi millennial bertindak sebagai agent of change yang berperan untuk memicu terjadinya sebuah perubahan. Perubahan yang diharapkan pada era ini seringkali dikaitkan dengan teknologi. Tidak terkecuali teknologi mengenai keuangan personal yakni investasi. Terutama pada pandemi, investasi dibutuhkan oleh masyarakat untuk menghadapi ketidakstabilan perekonomian. Akan tetapi, saat pandemi minat investor untuk berinvestasi di pasar modal meningkat sebab harga-harga mengalami penurunan. Selain itu, mayoritas investor merupakan milenial. Kesadaran memulai investasi didasari agar millennial dapat memenuhi kebutuhan keuangan di masa depan. Dengan kesadaran millennial untuk berinvestasi mendorong banyak perusahaan baik swasta maupun milik negara untuk menyelenggarakan investasi digital. Menurut OJK dan Kementrian Keuangan, sebelum memilih platform/aplikasi yang digunakan millennial perlu memahami aspek 2L yaitu legal dan logis serta aspek 2R yakni return (imbal hasil) and risk (risiko).

AB  - The new Industry 5.0 paradigm complements the well-known Industry 4.0 approach by specifically driving research and innovation to facilitate the transition to sustainable, human-centric and resilient industry. In the manufacturing context, workers' diversity in terms of experience, productivity and physical capacity represents a significant challenge for companies, especially those characterized by high staff turnover and manual processes with high workload and poor ergonomics. In seeking to address such challenges, this research adopts a human-centric perspective to define new flexible job arrangements by developing a new multi-objective job rotation scheduling model. The proposed model is unique in that it aims to achieve multiple job assignment objectives by simultaneously considering different socio-technical factors: workers' experience, physical capacity and limitations, postural ergonomic risks, noise and vibration exposure, and workers' boredom. The model's implementation in real environments can be supported by new sensor-based technologies that collect data on workers' efficiency, ergonomic scores and task performance and enable workers to participate in measuring perceived fatigue and boredom. The primary goal of our model is to find the most appropriate assignment of job and individual-flexible rest-break plan for each worker. The authors test the model application in an industrial setting. Useful managerial insights emerge and prescriptive recommendations are provided.

AB  - The most important particular indicator of the Energy Framework is planned for industrial energy conservation. Since it is heavily involved in rising power generation and transmission, distributed generation research understanding is growing. The complex, crucial situation between renewable and industrial customers for energy production and distribution in a privatized energy distribution environment uses “Smart Energy” and “Smart Power Generation” to convey a wider concept than the word “Smart Grid”. Although Smart Utilities are mainly based on the energy field, the interconnected systemic focus of Smart Energy Solutions is on the integration of multiple industries (power generation, warming, freezing, manufacturing, dwellings, and shipping) and facilitates the detection of more feasible and accessible technologies for the transition into potential solutions for sustainable and renewable energy. An innovative model for offering a holistic and integrated solution for a feasible, efficient, and reliable energy system is perceived to be smart electricity systems that incorporate multiple energy industries in the future. Smart energy mitigation has been regarded as a way of enhancing energy efficiency and reducing global gas emissions in enterprises on the policy framework. The most important unique measure of the Energy Framework is designed for industrial energy conservation. Although it is heavily entangled in rising energy production and transmission due to demand‐side management, research understanding is growing. That's the complex crucial situation for energy supply and management between utilities and industrial customers in a deregulated power marketing environment. The topology of the smart grid maintains the capacity for power consumption to focus on providing globally competitive infrastructure. Power Energy uses control steps to protect the energy system in spite of the use of energy. The energy consumption control concept is being used in this chapter to effectively control demands by using the smart grid for manufacturing industries. This also offers a description and statistical method of the specific demands of manufacturing customers with regard to implications of the energy consumption of an economic power system. This policy offers industrialized customers with an enticing opportunity to reduce pressures on services and sensibly control them during times of energy shortage, resulting in the maximum peak usage that runs off‐peak. The numerical and visual findings for manufacturing energy conservation are analyzed in this chapter.

AB  - The present review retraces the steps of the industrial and agriculture revolution that have taken place up to the present day, giving ideas and considerations for the future. This paper analyses the specific challenges facing agriculture along the farming supply chain to permit the operative implementation of Industry 4.0 guidelines. The subsequent scientific value is an investigation of how Industry 4.0 approaches can be improved and be pertinent to the agricultural sector. However, industry is progressing at a much faster rate than agriculture. In fact, already today experts talk about Industry 5.0. On the other hand, the 4.0 revolution in agriculture is still limited to a few innovative firms. For this reason, this work deals with how technological development affects different sectors (industry and agriculture) in different ways. In this innovative background, despite the advantages of industry or agriculture 4.0 for large enterprises, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) often face complications in such innovative processes due to the continuous development in innovations and technologies. Policy makers should propose strategies, calls for proposals with aim of supporting SMEs to invest on these technologies and making them more competitive in the marketplace.

AB  - The article examines the influence of natural history and socio-cultural processes on the formation of industrial areas within the borders of modern Russia and partially the Russian Empire and the USSR. Basically, the evolutionary approach is used in the version of cyclic genetic dynamics. To assess the long-term effects of the “path dependence”, we analyze the 150-year cycle of industrialization within the borders of Historical Russia. To do this, we use the mechanisms of spatial localization of Kondratiev cycles and associated technological structures of the first (first-second), second (third-fourth)) and the third (fifth) industrial revolution. As an information base, data on the number of people employed and the volume of industrial production (in comparable prices) are used, and for the XX century, data on the dynamics of fixed assets of industry are also used. The relationship between modernization schemes on the old basis (within the boundaries of old industrial areas) and in the areas of pioneer development is revealed. The stability of industry specializations within the grid of industrial areas is considered separately. Based on the results obtained, the conclusion is made about the stability of old industrial cores of localization of industrial potential, the continuity of the spectrum of their specializations (not the replacement of old industries with new ones, but the addition). There is also a repetition in the regions of the new development of the General scheme of the chosen path and the inherited track.

AB  - This paper provides preliminary discourse on buzz words about Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0. This discourse focuses on the lens of Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and Machine Learning of Artificial Intelligence (MLAI). To some extent several companies have embarked Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0 within Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Through the wave of IoT Technology, Industries are adopting automated machinery. Predictive maintenance (PM) is indispensable not only toward the machines” vitality and longevity purpose, but also toward the human error reduction. This paper elaborates its discourse of Industry 4.0 and Society through the lens of CBM and MLAI. The mentioned Machine Learning, in this paper, refers to research methodology, as methodological frameworks. Those frameworks comprise several phases, which are: 1. Equipment Analysis; 2. Data Evaluation; 3. Data Selection and Process; 4. Modeling; 5. Decision Support Model Evaluation. The MLAI techniques are based upon the identification of behaviour patterns. This identification comprises datasets that exclude mathematical models or prior historical knowledge. The discourse in this paper intertwines CBM process and MLAI through data cleaning and processing, features stratification and extraction, model stratification and validation. This paper elaborates two renowned maintenance approaches which are preventive and corrective maintenance. Discourse in this paper focuses on corrective action, known as predictive maintenance (PM), or condition based maintenance (CBM) within Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM). CBM is chosen as the most desirable strategy, as it involves the intervention as the consequence of the machine breakdown. It also provides cost savings toward spare parts consumption, and optimizes production.

AB  - With the upcoming fifth Industrial Revolution, humans and collaborative robots will dance together in production. They themselves act as an agent in a connected world, understood as a multi-agent system, in which the Laplacian spectrum plays an important role since it can define the connection of the complex networks as well as depict the robustness. In addition, the Laplacian spectrum can locally check the controllability and observability of a dynamic controlled network, etc. This paper presents a new method, which is based on the Augmented Lagrange based Alternating Direction Inexact Newton (ALADIN) method, to faster the convergence rate of the Laplacian Spectrum Estimation via factorization of the average consensus matrices, that are expressed as Laplacian-based matrices problems. Herein, the non-zero distinct Laplacian eigenvalues are the inverse of the stepsizes {αt,t=1,2,…} of those matrices. Therefore, the problem now is to carry out the agreement on the stepsize values for all agents in the given network while ensuring the factorization of average consensus matrices to be accomplished. Furthermore, in order to obtain the entire Laplacian spectrum, it is necessary to estimate the relevant multiplicities of these distinct eigenvalues. Consequently, a non-convex optimization problem is formed and solved using ALADIN method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated through the simulation results and the comparison with the Lagrange-based method in advance.

AB  - Planners are supported in the fulfilment of their tasks by so-called PPC systems. Among other things, planners are dissatisfied with the way PPC systems present information and results. As a result, there is a risk that the number of errors due to misinterpretations will increase. These are primarily caused by Cognitive Biases. Even increasing automation will not change this, since according to experts, humans will remain central, especially in decision-making. The European Union points out that Industry 4.0 focuses more on technical feasibility and implementation and less on human needs. In response, it proposes the human-centered approach of Industry 5.0. Here, the human being should move to the center of the process. In this regard, there is still little research activity in the field of PPC and in the context of Cognitive Biases. Therefore, we want to take a first step towards the human-centered approach with this work. To this end, we conduct a systematic literature review and develop a questionnaire to determine the human-centered maturity level. The results will then be compared with already researched Cognitive Biases.

AB  - Within the context of Industry 4.0 and of the new emerging Industry 5.0, human factors are becoming increasingly important, especially in Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC). This paper provides a novel study focused on the human aspects involved in industrial HRC by exploring the effects of various HRC setting factors. In particular, this paper aims at investigating the impact of industrial HRC on user experience, affective state, and stress, assessed through both subjective measures (i.e., questionnaires) and objective ones (i.e., physiological signals). A collaborative assembly task was implemented with different configurations, in which the robot movement speed, the distance between the operator and the robot workspace, and the control of the task execution time were varied. Forty-two participants were involved in the study and provided feedbacks on interaction quality and their affective state. Participants’ physiological responses (i.e., electrodermal activity and heart rate) were also collected non-invasively to monitor the amount of stress generated by the interaction. Analysis of both subjective and objective responses revealed how the configuration factors considered influence them. Robot movement speed and control of the task execution time resulted to be the most influential factors. The results also showed the need for customization of HRC to improve ergonomics, both psychological and physical, and the well-being of the operator.

AB  - Rapid advances in technology have spurred tremendous progress in developing the next generation of Industry 4.0 that was initially introduced in 2011 as a German strategic initiative for revolutionizing the manufacturing sector. Ten years have passed since 2011. In these ten years, numerous new and promising technologies and applications have been developed. The original concept of Industry 4.0, including the conceptual framework, technology framework, and enabling technologies, has experienced tremendous changes. As such, the new generation of Industry 4.0 emerges, which is also called Industry 5.0. Today, we are on the cusp of the Industry 4.0 evolution supported by a new set of enabling technologies. In such evolution of Industry 4.0, future Industry 4.0 requires a combination of recently emerging new technologies, which is giving rise to the emergence of the next generation of Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. Such technologies originate from different disciplines, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), 5G/6G, Quantum Computing, and others. The technologies in the original Industry 4.0 framework, such as Cyber-Physical Systems, IoT, etc., will be affected by Artificial Intelligence (AI), 5G/6G, and Quantum Computing. At this present moment, the emergence of a new era of Industry 4.0 can be seen. In this paper, we briefly survey the main emerging enabling technologies in Industry 4.0 as it relates to industries.

AB  - In order to realize the goals of Industry 5.0 (I5.0), which has data interoperability as one of its core principles, the future research in the Supply Chain (SC) visibility has to be aligned with socially, economically and environmentally sustainable objectives. Within the purview of circular economy, this paper indicates various aspects and implications of data sharing in the SCs in light of the published research. Taking into consideration the heterogeneity of data sources and standards, this article also catalog all the major data-sharing technologies being employed in sharing data digitally across the SCs. Drawing on the published research from 2015 to 2021, following the PRISMA framework, this paper presents the state of research in the field of data sharing in SCs in terms of their standardization, optimization, simulation, automation, security and more notably sustainability. Using the co-occurrence metric, bibliometric analysis has been conducted such that the collected research is categorized under various keyword clusters and regional themes. This article brings together two major themes in reviewing the research in the field. Firstly, the bibliometric analysis of the published articles makes manifest the contours of the current state of research and the future possibilities in the field. Secondly, in synthesizing the research on the foundations of sustainability within the CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework, this article deals with the various aspects and implications of information sharing in the SCs. By bringing these two themes together, this paper affords a prospective researcher with the research vis-à-vis the information sharing in SC, starting from the actual data standards in use to the modality and consequence of their application within the perspective of the circular economy. This article, in essence, indicates how all the aspects of data sharing in SCs may be brought together in service of the theme of I5.0.

AB  - A digital twin for a multifunctional technology for flexible manufacturing on an assembly, disassembly, and repair mechatronics line (A/D/RML), assisted by a complex autonomous system (CAS), is presented in the paper. The hardware architecture consists of the A/D/RML and a six-workstation (WS) mechatronics line (ML) connected to a flexible cell (FC) and equipped with a six-degree of freedom (DOF) industrial robotic manipulator (IRM). The CAS has in its structure two driving wheels and one free wheel (2DW/1FW)-wheeled mobile robot (WMR) equipped with a 7-DOF robotic manipulator (RM). On the end effector of the RM, a mobile visual servoing system (eye-in-hand MVSS) is mounted. The multifunctionality is provided by the three actions, assembly, disassembly, and repair, while the flexibility is due to the assembly of different products. After disassembly or repair, CAS picks up the disassembled components and transports them to the appropriate storage depots for reuse. Disassembling or repairing starts after assembling, and the final assembled product fails the quality test. The virtual world that serves as the digital counterpart consists of tasks assignment, planning and synchronization of A/D/RML with integrated robotic systems, IRM, and CAS. Additionally, the virtual world includes hybrid modeling with synchronized hybrid Petri nets (SHPN), simulation of the SHPN models, modeling of the MVSS, and simulation of the trajectory-tracking sliding-mode control (TTSMC) of the CAS. The real world, as counterpart of the digital twin, consists of communication, synchronization, and control of A/D/RML and CAS. In addition, the real world includes control of the MVSS, the inverse kinematic control (IKC) of the RM and graphic user interface (GUI) for monitoring and real-time control of the whole system. The “Digital twin” approach has been designed to meet all the requirements and attributes of Industry 4.0 and beyond towards Industry 5.0, the target being a closer collaboration between the human operator and the production line.

AB  - AI techniques are required for realizing society 5.0. For the issues of societal implementation for AI, an AI hardware, which is enhanced security performances including authentication, and so on, is needed in order to reduce security risks. This study proposes a new physical unclonable function (PUF) based on neural network (NN) called NN PUF. The proposed NN PUF uses a difference of calculation time in NN due to production variations of semiconductor. Evaluation experiments using a field programmable gate array (FPGA) prove the effectiveness of the proposed NN PUF.

AB  - The innovation-driven Industry 5.0 leads us to consider humanity in a prominent position as the center of the manufacturing field even more than Industry 4.0. This pushes us towards the hybridization of manufacturing plants promoting a full collaboration between humans and robots. However, there are currently very few workplaces where effective Human–Robot Collaboration takes place. Layout designing plays a key role in assuring safe and efficient Human–Robot Collaboration. The layout design, especially in the context of collaborative robotics, is a complex problem to face, since it is related to safety, ergonomics, and productivity aspects. In the current work, a Knowledge-Based Approach (KBA) is adopted to face the complexity of the layout design problem. The framework resulting from the KBA allows for developing a modeling paradigm that enables us to define a streamlined approach for the layout design. The proposed approach allows for placing resource within the workplace according to a defined optimization criterion, and also ensures compliance with various standards. This approach is applied to an industrial case study in order to prove its feasibility. A what-if analysis is performed by applying the proposed approach. Changing three control factors (i.e., minimum distance, robot speed, logistic space configuration) on three levels, in a Design of Experiments, 27 layout configurations of the same workplace are generated. Consequently, the inputs that most affect the layout design are identified by means of an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The results show that only one layout is eligible to be the best configuration, and only two out of three control factors are very significant for the designing of the HRC workplace layout. Hence, the proposed approach enables the designing of standard compliant and optimized HRC workplace layouts. Therefore, several alternatives of the layout for the same workplace can be easily generated and investigated in a systematic manner.

AB  - Technological digitalization and the capabilities of artificial intelligence are among the main tools recommended to companies to overcome the negative consequences of the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. And this is true not only for companies in the high-tech sector, but also for those who are part of the supply chains of natural resources such as natural gas. Moreover, in addition to the flexibility of technological solutions, natural gas supply companies are expected to protect their place in the renewable / regenerative / economy, which defines natural gas as one of the clean energy sources. To meet these challenges, the article examines how and in what way the ongoing global crisis provoked by the COVID 19 pandemic is slowing down the processes of technological digitalization and integration of business processes in gas supply companies, i.e., to what extent these companies have "walked the path" of the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0. We are looking for answers to these questions on the basis of an empirical study conducted in gas companies, showing the change in the level of technological innovation, the development of linkages between individual business processes, and the place of artificial intelligence in their overall activities.

AB  - In recent years, the IoT (Internet of Things) has been attracting attention as a basic technology that supports Society 5.0. We are promoting research and development to ensure product quality and worker safety in the industrial field by utilizing IoT. The purpose of this research is to automatically detect dangerous behavior of workers in crane operation work from a camera at a manufacturing site that handles large products. In this study, we conducted an experiment to detect dangerous behavior for four items of crane operation work using video data obtained from on-site surveillance cameras. It was confirmed that the positions of the worker and the suspended load could be sensed by person detection and object detection, and dangerous acts could be detected from their positional relationship.

AB  - We provide an experimental evaluation of a wearable augmented reality (AR) system we have developed for human-robot teams working on tasks requiring collaboration in shared physical workspace. Recent advances in AR technology have facilitated the development of more intuitive user interfaces for many human-robot interaction applications. While it has been anticipated that AR can provide a more intuitive interface to robot assistants helping human workers in various manufacturing scenarios, existing studies in robotics have been largely limited to teleoperation and programming. Industry 5.0 envisions cooperation between human and robot working in teams. Indeed, there exist many industrial tasks that can benefit from human-robot collaboration. A prime example is high-value composite manufacturing. Working with our industry partner towards this example application, we evaluated our AR interface design for shared physical workspace collaboration in human-robot teams. We conducted a multi-dimensional analysis of our interface using established metrics. Results from our user study (n = 26) show that, subjectively, the AR interface feels more novel and a standard joystick interface feels more dependable to users. However, the AR interface was found to reduce physical demand and task completion time, while increasing robot utilization. Furthermore, user’s freedom of choice to collaborate with the robot may also affect the perceived usability of the system.

AB  - Industry 4.0 is moving forward under technology upgrades, utilizing information technology to improve the intelligence of the industry, whereas Industry 5.0 is value-driven, aiming to focus on essential societal needs, values, and responsibility. The manufacturing industry is currently moving towards the integration of productivity enhancements and sustainable human employment. Such a transformation has deeply changed the human–machine interaction (HMI), among which digital twin (DT) and extended reality (XR) are two cutting-edge technologies. A manufacturing DT offers an opportunity to simulate, monitor, and optimize the machine. In the meantime, XR empowers HMI in the industrial field. This paper presents an XR application framework for DT-based services within a manufacturing context. This work aims to develop a technological framework to improve the efficiency of the XR application development and the usability of the XR-based HMI systems. We first introduce four layers of the framework, including the perception layer with the physical machine and its ROS-based simulation model, the machine communication layer, the network layer containing three kinds of communication middleware, and the Unity-based service layer creating XR-based digital applications. Subsequently, we conduct the responsiveness test for the framework and describe several XR industrial applications for a DT-based smart crane. Finally, we highlight the research challenges and potential issues that should be further addressed by analyzing the performance of the whole framework.

AB  - Jugaad originates from the Indian language of Hindi that vaguely means the courageous act of improvising an effective solution with the limited possible resources to overcome the harsh constraints. Often considered to be a rough, informal innovation, Jugaad helps address social problems and blends seamlessly with the Sustainable Development Goals and the Society 5.0. This chapter looks at Jugaad from an innovation perspective, taking the entrepreneurial lens of Jugaad through the Bricolage Theory of Entrepreneurship. Five independent cases are selected for this study to showcase the behaviour of jugaad innovations in solving a social problem and the process of the jugaad becoming a core value of the firm. These cases were selected based on purposive sampling. The selected cases were recognised by the National Innovation Foundation, Government of India in their initiative to enhance grassroots technology breakthroughs and excellent traditional knowledge. The cases address the Sustainable Development Goal-12 Responsible Consumption and Production and analyse how the innovations address Society 5.0, including use of resources, people-centric societies, merging of cyber and physical spaces and knowledge-intensive institutional structures that can enable scalability of Jugaad innovations, and sustainability of Jugaad innovations.

AB  - Purpose: Despite the significant attention that Industry 4.0 (I4.0) has gained in the last decade, little importance has been given to shop-floor workers' role in effectively implementing these new technologies in production systems. Nowadays, several authors discuss the need to bring workers back to the center of the decision-making about implementing the new technologies in what is being called Industry 5.0 (I5.0). A key factor of using these new concepts is that it must make sense, and the new information generated by these technologies must have a precise use; otherwise, it will be considered waste. The Lean approach is already recognized as the best approach to identify and eliminate waste from production systems. Not only that, but it allows decisions about process improvement to be human-centric. Thus, this article aims to present the main aspects and evolution of I4.0 and I5.0 over time, using the Lean approach as the analysis lenses.
 Study design/methodology/approach: In order to identify the mains aspects of I4.0 and I5.0, we develop a consistent literature review using the Systematic Search Flow (SSF).
 Findings: As a result, it was possible to identify the evolution from I4.0 to I5.0, In I4.0, the main focus was on developing new technologies, combine them with classic Lean tools (e.g. Kanban 4.0, Poka-Yoke 4.0) and implement Cyber-Physical Systems. In I5.0, the focus is to use these new technologies together with shop floor workers to continuously improve production processes. Not only that, but in I5.0, the protagonist becomes (or return to become) the shop floor workers to lead the improvements, as is in the Toyota Kata approach.
 Originality/value: This work presents a new way of interpreting the progression of concepts from I4.0 to I5.0. In addition, the focus on workers for problem solving is returning to the center of the discussion. Together with the technologies of I4.0, this represents a new area for future research.

AB  - The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in a smart society, in which the analysis of human habits is mandatory, requires automated data scheduling and analysis using smart applications, a smart infrastructure, smart systems, and a smart network. In this context, which is characterized by a large gap between training and operative processes, a dedicated method is required to manage and extract the massive amount of data and the related information mining. The method presented in this work aims to reduce this gap with near-zero-failure advanced diagnostics (AD) for smart management, which is exploitable in any context of Society 5.0, thus reducing the risk factors at all management levels and ensuring quality and sustainability. We have also developed innovative applications for a human-centered management system to support scheduling in the maintenance of operative processes, for reducing training costs, for improving production yield, and for creating a human–machine cyberspace for smart infrastructure design. The results obtained in 12 international companies demonstrate a possible global standardization of operative processes, leading to the design of a near-zero-failure intelligent system that is able to learn and upgrade itself. Our new method provides guidance for selecting the new generation of intelligent manufacturing and smart systems in order to optimize human–machine interactions, with the related smart maintenance and education.

AB  - This chapter highlights the convergence of soft computing techniques with contemporary manufacturing and machining processes. The chapter has been divided into two subsegments, with the first one comprehensively discussing the machining processes and the integration of automation techniques in these processes. The importance and utility of computerized numerical control and part programming are interlinked with automation hardware and robotics. The extension of machining in Integrated Manufacturing Systems (IMS) with coordinated functioning of robotics and numerical control is also emphasized. The correlation of precision and Computer Integrated (Flexible) Manufacturing (CIM) cites key advantages of automation and computerized control over the conventional non-mechanized machining techniques or manual material removal operations. In the second subsegment, soft computing as a systems engineering approach has been discussed interlinking its aptness for the machining operations. The current soft computing methods including fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks (ANN), and genetic algorithms (GA) for the predictive modeling of machining operations has been elaborated in this chapter citing their utilization and significance in controlling, monitoring, and modeling these tasks. A comparison of soft computing approach for machining has also been associated with the finite element modeling (FEM) methods to outweigh the benefits of automated control and modeling in each operation, and their suitability for the specific machining tasks. The generic discussion is presented to the readers for selecting the suitable automation and modeling approach to augment certain machining tasks in the segment on computational optimization of themachining processes. The key soft computing modules are highlighted in a concluding synopsis as a mechanism for driving future process modernizations from the perspective of Industry 5.0 leveraging customer-centric digitization, advanced modeling technologies, cognitive computing, big-data management, robots, and smart machines tethered together for eco-friendly machining.

AB  - The global system continues to process by keeping its essence through some protective and nationalist attempts. It is actually significant that the global system involves a multidimensional and technology-driven structure and that national-states’ regulations occur along with transnational practices. In this system, new technologies have a big role. New technologies consist of some innovations such as artificial intelligence, robotics, big data, internet of things, cloud technology, and so on, that describe the concept of ‘Society 5.0’ proposed by Japan and the concept of ‘Industry 4.0’ proposed by Germany. These technologies create super smart society in terms of their impacts on improving human life. Smart technologies improve human life in the fields of education, health, security, etc. On the other hand, smart technologies used in the process of production shape the global production network and the innovative strategies of firms. It is required that new technologies should not be remained uncontrolled within the logic of ‘laissez faire’ because their impacts and power are so great. Thus, national-states should make efficient economic policies by also considering transnational practices; like that Japan and Germany develop their own national view in terms of Society 5.0 and Industry 4.0. Such fields come into prominence in the economic policies in respect of new technologies: Competition policy on the basis of global competition and innovativeness—Industrialization policy on the basis of emerging industries of new technologies—Intellectual property policy on the basis of the rights of people and firms producing knowledge and innovation—Employment policy on the basis of new occupations and specialities in the global age—Social policy on the basis of new technologies’ control on individual and social life.

AB  - In Industry 5.0, human workers and their wellbeing are placed at the centre of the production process. In this context, task-oriented dialogue systems allow workers to delegate simple tasks to industrial assets while working on other, more complex ones. The possibility of naturally interacting with these systems reduces the cognitive demand to use them and triggers acceptation. Most modern solutions, however, do not allow a natural communication, and modern techniques to obtain such systems require large amounts of data to be trained, which is scarce in these scenarios. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents KIDE4I (Knowledge-drIven Dialogue framEwork for Industry), a semantic-based task-oriented dialogue system framework for industry that allows workers to naturally interact with industrial systems, is easy to adapt to new scenarios and does not require great amounts of data to be constructed. This work also reports the process to adapt KIDE4I to new scenarios. To validate and evaluate KIDE4I, it has been adapted to four use cases that are relevant to industrial scenarios following the described methodology, and two of them have been evaluated through two user studies. The system has been considered as accurate, useful, efficient, not demanding cognitively, flexible and fast. Furthermore, subjects view the system as a tool to improve their productivity and security while carrying out their tasks.

AB  - The increasing need for economic, safe, and sustainable smart manufacturing combined with novel technological enablers has paved the way for artificial intelligence (AI) and big data in industries. This implies a substantial integration of AI, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), Robotics, big data, Blockchain, and 5G communications in support of smart manufacturing and the dynamical processes in modern industries. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of different aspects of AI and big data in Industry 4.0 with a particular focus on key applications, techniques, the concepts involved, key enabling technologies, challenges, and research perspective toward deployment of Industry 5.0. In detail, we highlight and analyze how the duo of AI and big data is helping in different applications of Industry 4.0. We also highlight key challenges in a successful deployment of AI and big data solutions in smart industrial applications with a particular emphasis on data-related issues, such as availability, bias, auditing, management, interpretability, communication, and different adversarial attacks and security issues. Finally, we explore the significance of AI and big data toward Industry 4.0 applications through panoramic reviews and discussions. This work is expected to provide a baseline for future research in the domain.

AB  - Worldwide, manufacturers are reimagining the future of their workforce and its connection to technology. Rather than replacing humans, Industry 5.0 explores how humans and robots can best complement one another's unique strengths. However, realizing this vision requires an in-depth understanding of how workers view the positive and negative attributes of their jobs, and the place of robots within it. In this paper, we explore the relationship between work attributes and automation goals by engaging in field research at a manufacturing plant. We conducted 50 face-to-face interviews with assembly-line workers $(\mathrm{n}=50)$, which we analyzed using discourse analysis and social constructivist methods. We found that the work attributes deemed most positive by participants include social interaction, movement and exercise, (human) autonomy, problem solving, task variety, and building with their hands. The main negative work attributes included health and safety issues, feeling rushed, and repetitive work. We identified several ways robots could help reduce negative work attributes and enhance positive ones, such as reducing work interruptions and cultivating physical and psychological well-being. Based on our findings, we created a set of integration considerations for organizations planning to deploy robotics technology, and discuss how the manufacturing and HRI communities can explore these ideas in the future.

AB  - The European Commission defined the new concept of Industry 5.0 meaning a more human-centric, resilient, and sustainable approach for the design of industrial systems and operations. A deep understanding of the work environment and organization is important to start analysing the working conditions and the resulting User eXperience (UX) of the operators. Also, the knowledge about users’ needs and ergonomics is fundamental to optimize the workers’ wellbeing, working conditions, and industrial results. In this context, the paper presents a strategy to effectively assess the UX of workers to promote human-centric vision of manufacturing sites, enhancing the overall sustainability of the modern factories. A set of non-invasive wearable devices is used to monitor human activities and collect physiological parameters, as well as questionnaires to gather subjective self-assessment. This set-up was applied to virtual reality (VR) simulation, replicating heavy duty work sequence tasks that took place in an oil and gas pipes manufacturing site. This approach allowed the identification of possible stressful conditions for the operator, from physical and mental perspectives, which may compromise the performance. This research was funded by the European Community's HORIZON 2020 programme under grant agreement No. 958303 (PENELOPE).

AB  - An impact of a modern industrial system, such as in Industry 5.0, which brings customer authorization deeper into the manufacturing stream, may give pressure toward the industrial working system. Along with this system transformation, the declining trend of labor number as world demographical change created demand for higher productivity worker, which is stronger and more versatile for handling more than one working station, giving added value and personalization in fulfilling customer needs. Assistive Technology (AT) which is formerly for disabled or handicapped people, would be more widely used for everyone and working for its new purposes in producing higher individual physical capacity. A common challenge of providing a wearable AT, such as limb prostheses, orthoses, or exoskeletons, is customizing their geometry to fit on user body parts. In Industrial context, this would even be more challenging since it must be provided in massive number which can overburden companies overhead. The disruptive technology of prototyping such as 3D scanning and 3D printing brings a customized prototype into a new level of accomplishment life cycle and affordability. New processing technology and material development in 3D printing eventually transform rapid prototyping into rapid manufacturing of final AT product. This paper aims to examine recent research and development of AT from AT developers and communities as well as its novel development process. The new challenges of new AT existence are discussed further in the context of working safety and product standardization and a study about its impacts towards industrial productivity are highlighted.

AB  - Industry 5.0 has laid the necessity to relocate the human at the center of the manufacturing cycle, where everything should be designed to ease his/her work. This implies one to redefine the human-robot collaboration, making it not only safe, but also more inclusive for the operator. Nowadays, this goal is viable thanks to the integration of new sensors in the work cell. Coupled with advanced control strategies, they give the robot a better understanding of both the surrounding environment and the human movement, allowing a more organic cooperation. This paper exploits an RGBD camera and Deep Learning algorithms to retrieve the 3D positions of the manipulated objects in the workspace and to infer the most likely future human destinations in a pick and place case study. Merging this information, a proper control logic is defined and tested in a real robotics application, with the final intent of minimizing human-robot collisions during the collaboration and making the process more reliable and efficient.

AB  - WT is one of the most important and advancing technologies of sustainable energies due to their challenged energy resources that can be very profitable, principally for commercial scale production of electrical power. Composite materials stiffness and strength of the blade structure are essential of WT and should be accurately designed as they play a decisive role in inhancing the turbine performance and durability. Mechanical elasticity analysis and damage evolution of the blade structure are the main issues in studying the behavior of composite structures, instead of that the modal and random vibration analysis are also the main of interest of studying such as dynamic structures. In this paper, methods and approaches of composite materials enhancement of WT blades are reviewed, including some numerical methods used in this context. Hence, the recent research results of WT technologies with historical results achieved are explored. This numerical models are assessed the performance of WT and optimization procedures applied to blade conception. A good attention has been paid to know about the recent optimization strategies of WT blade proposed for the engineers and researchers. Besides, the industry 5.0 involves for using AI techniques to facilitate the exploitation of numerical data from the whole numerical studies of mechanical behavior of composite materials such as elasticity, plasticity, damage initiation and damage tolerance using a well-known commercial software solver.

AB  - In recent years manufacturing and assembly lines are undergoing workplace changes with a scope to adapt to the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) design principles. Automation of manufacturing, collaborative robots (cobots), interconnection of cyber physical systems (CPS), cloud computing, big data analytics and Augmented/Virtual reality (AR/VR) are some of the technologies that are being introduced in industry. Human operators are required to adapt and integrate into those new environments. Human operators should be flexible in their work-tasks, upgrade their skillset and be able to act as a safeguard entity in this complex and dynamic environment. A recent shift in paradigms, the Industry 5.0 concept, focus on the sustainability of the human factor inside the technologies that I4.0 framework introduced, and relates to the ageing workforce issue and the change in individuals’ capabilities. Productivity and safety of the ageing operators in the new workplace environment is causally related to their capabilities. In this research paper, we (i) study the interactions of human operator inside the “smart” workplace and (ii) develop a model using the entropy concept of statistical mechanics. This model can be utilized in the evaluation of human factor inside the complex environment by computing the probability of error based on human operator capabilities.

AB  - This chapter introduces advanced aluminum alloy matrix composites and their manufacturing processes. In the beginning, the state of the art is characterized and the general characteristics of aluminum and its practical applications are presented, starting with the history of aluminum. The current approximate distribution of bauxite resources in the world and the production of bauxite and alumina in the leading countries of the world, as well as the production of primary and secondary aluminum and the range of aluminum end products, are presented. Aluminum alloys intended for plastic deformation and castings, and composite materials in general and with a matrix of aluminum alloys in particular, have been characterized in general. Against this background, a detailed review of the results of the Author’s own research included in numerous projects and own publications on advanced composite materials, their production technology, their structure, and properties were done. The range of aluminum alloy matrices of composite materials was adequately characterized, which include AlSi12, AlSi7Mg0.3, AlMg1SiCu, AlMg3, AlMg5, and AlMg9, respectively. Composite materials tested in terms of manufacturing technology include three groups. The first group includes gas pressure infiltration with liquid aluminum alloys of suitably formed porous preforms. Porous frameworks as a reinforcement for pressure-infiltrated composite materials with a matrix of aluminum alloys are produced by three methods. Al2O3 powder with the addition of 30–50% carbon fibers is uniaxially pressed, sintered, and heated to thermally degrade the carbon fibers and create the required pore sizes. In the second case, the ceramic porous skeleton is produced with the use of halloysite nanotubes HNTs by mechanical milling, press consolidation, and sintering. A third method is SLS selective laser sintering using titanium powders. Another group of manufacturing technologies is the mechanical synthesis of the mixture of AlMg1SiCu aluminum alloy powder and respectively, halloysite nanotubes HNTs in a volume fraction from 5 to 15% or multi-wall carbon nanotubes MWCNTs in a volume fraction from 0.5 to 5%, and subsequent consolidation involving plastic deformation. The third group of analyzed materials concerns composite surface layers on substrates of aluminum alloys produced by laser feathering of WC/W2C or SiC carbides. The structure and properties of the mentioned composite materials with aluminum alloys matrices are described in detail. The chapter summary provides final remarks on the importance of advanced aluminum alloy composite materials in industrial development. The importance of particular groups of engineering materials in the history and the development of the methodology for the selection of engineering materials, including the current stage of Materials 4.0, was emphasized. The importance of material design in engineering design is emphasized. Concepts of the development of societies were presented: Society 5.0 and Industry 4.0. The own concept of a holistic model of the extended Industry 4.0 was presented, taking into account advanced engineering materials and technological processes. Particular attention was paid to the importance of advanced composite materials with an aluminum alloy matrix in the context of the current stage of Industry 4.0 of the industrial revolution. Growth in the production of aluminum, its alloys, and composites with its matrix was compared with that of steel. Despite the 30 times less production, aluminum is important due to its lower density. The challenges posed by the development in the Industry 4.0 stage, including the expectations of the automotive and aviation industry, force constant progress in the development of new materials with the participation of aluminum, including the composite materials with an aluminum alloy matrix presented in this chapter.

AB  - A global transformation from Industry 4.0 towards Industry 5.0 will soon take place. Such transformations are intrinsic to human and sustainable value creation. An increasing number of companies, recognising this imminent trend, will need to transform their current classical, solely profit-oriented business models into sustainable business models that also target human, social, and environmental aspects. Various frameworks already exist that support the design of sustainable business models. Practical applications of these frameworks and research on the transformation process in the production domain, which places a special focus on small and medium enterprises, is still scarce. This paper presents the first results from a sustainable business model transformation project on a European SME, which produces 3D printers. The research method applies a single case study design. The study was based on publicly available information and qualitative data, obtained through interviews and workshops carried out on an executive management level.

AB  - Production systems are being expanded to include Digital Twins (DTs) as part of increased industrial digitalization. DTs can bring benefits e.g., increase visibility, safety, and accessibility of the system. Further, digital experimentation can reduce time and cost. Though, application of DT technologies involves challenges i.e., model accuracy or errors in transferring data or codes between the DT and the physical twin. Many studies on DTs focus on industrial applications. However, DT technology has potential for implementation of digital labs in education. This aspect of DTs is of rising importance as distance education has increased over the last decade and access to physical laboratories can be restricted due to factors such as the Covid-19 pandemic. Thus, there is a need to study the use of DT technology in higher education. To address this, we investigate possibilities and challenges of applying DT technology in education to conduct industrial-like labs virtually. A case of an automation line, with full scale industrial equipment, based at a research center, is focused. Results emphasize that the application of DT technologies require multi-domain expertise to understand the consequences of every single decision in the design process on every piece of equipment involved, making the modelling process complex and time consuming. Thus, when applied in education, test procedures need to be designed to focus on students’ motivation, improved learning and understanding of production systems. DTs are considered enabling technologies supporting the concept of Industry 5.0, thus stressing the human-centric aspects of advancing Industry 4.0. The predicted application of DTs emphasizes the need for educational curricula that include laboratory applications and theoretic understanding of DT technologies. This study focusses the application of DT technologies in higher education curricula, but the result of the study can contribute to other areas such as automation and virtual commissioning towards smarter manufacturing.

AB  - The transition of economy to the “Industry 5.0” paradigm and the Sixth Technological Mode will be much more effective if the management models of the real economy sector are ahead of technological, technical, organizational and other processes. The article discusses the structure of a multi-agent system for the management of the electronics industry. A list of requirements for such a system has been proposed, the fulfillment of which will ensure the use of the system for the prompt adoption of optimal management decisions. The article emphasizes that the work of scientists and specialists in the electronics industry in the context of the widespread introduction of digital technologies in the economy must comply with the Ashby rule. This means that the national control subsystem of the industry must have a margin of complexity in comparison with the complexity of the controlled subjects and processes. Therefore, the creation of a multi-agent platform will ensure the implementation of this management law in the industry. A multi-agent platform for coordination, planning and logistics conjugation of adjacent chains of manufacturers and consumers of electronics may be in demand in the very near future, which makes this article relevant.

AB  - Manufacturing engineering is now moving into the digital era, otherwise known as Industry 4.0. The next paradigm shift that is fast approaching and this is the era of personalisation and customisation, known as Industry 5.0. To facilitate this personalisation of products, human and technology must work together seamlessly in a manner where the best of both is leveraged. Human centred systems are at the heart of this revolution. One of the most important enablers of this change is the education of our technologists, our university degrees and post graduate programmes must embed this expertise into their core modules. This contribution looks the educational aspects of the MSc in Engineering Management in the Technical University of Vienna Austria (TUWien) as an example of education which has evolved to facilitate emerging trends. An introduction and a short history of this executive postgraduate MSc is presented, as it is a long established and well know programme which dates back to 1995.

AB  - In this paper we introduce a research agenda to guide the development of the next generation of Discrete Event Simulation (DES) systems. Interfaces to digital twins are projected to go beyond physical representations to become blueprints for the actual “objects” and an active dashboard for their control. The role and importance of real-time interactive animations presented in an Extended Reality (XR) format will be explored. The need for using game engines, particularly their physics engines and AI within interactive simulated Extended Reality is expanded on. Importing and scanning real-world environments is assumed to become more efficient when using AR. Exporting to VR and AR is recommended to be a default feature. A technology framework for the next generation simulators is presented along with a proposed set of implementation guidelines. The need for more human centric technology approaches, nascent in Industry 4.0, are now central to the emerging Industry 5.0 paradigm; an agenda that is discussed in this research as part of a human in the loop future, supported by DES. The potential role of Explainable Artificial Intelligence is also explored along with an audit trail approach to provide a justification of complex and automated decision-making systems with relation to DES. A technology framework is proposed, which brings the above together and can serve as a guide for the next generation of holistic simulators for manufacturing.

AB  - A true artificial intelligence (AI) system is something that "learns" from the data it stores,  in order to perform tasks and solve problems that typically require human intelligence - either with the help of a human expert or independently. The area of AI is an interdisciplinary field, which has been designated as a strategic area in the European Union (EU) approach and a key driver of economic development that can bring solutions to many social challenges and problems. Due to its nature and its tendency to be digitally advanced and smarter with analytics, the financial sector is one of the early adopters of AI and expects multiple benefits from its application, that is, the ability to provide better service in the shortest time possible and at a lower cost. AI in the financial sector is based on an understanding of the business needs of financial organizations, institutions and markets and the ability to connect with technological capabilities. They are powerful tools that completely transform this sector. The basic idea of this paper is to consider where the real value of AI in the financial sector is, i.e. what are the practical aspects and business implications of AI in the financial sector globally. It is common knowledge that evolving technologies have always had a strong impact on the sectors in which they are applied because they give them the opportunity to improve existing manufacturing processes, services, customer experiences, operate more efficiently, achieve cost savings, etc. The aim of this paper is to identify areas of application of AI in the financial sector, and to explore leading AI applications that are changing the financial ecosystem, transforming the financial sector and that have the potential to significantly improve many of its functions. The paper further highlights other implications of AI implementation in the financial sector such as employment - job creation and termination of existing AI-influenced employment, the scope and potential of application in developing countries, the problem of regulation and use in the best interests of man, and the importance of properly managing specific AI risks.

AB  - The changes in the industry have gone through many stages until today. These changes can be called a transition phase of industries that lasts for years. The process that started with the emergence of the Industry 1.0 concept first came to the concept of Industry 4.0. Recently, Industry 5.0 concepts are spoken around the world. Germany, where the concept of Industry 4.0 first emerged, is leading Industry 4.0 revolution. With the emergence of this concept, different topics such as smart factories, cybersecurity, simulation, 3D printers, and autonomous robots have come to the fore. These subheadings are undoubtedly very important topics for a factory. To fully implement the Industry 4.0 system, these subheadings must be applied and their sustainability must be ensured. In this study, the 3D printer selection process of a factory that wants to fully integrate its factory into a new revolution is discussed. This problem is called a multicriteria decision problem in terms of being very different criteria and alternatives. Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method was used to solve the problem, and the results were interpreted.

AB  - Autonomous transportation is a new paradigm of an Industry 5.0 cyber-physical system that provides a lot of opportunities in smart logistics applications. The safety and reliability of deep learning-driven systems are still a question under research. The safety of an autonomous guided vehicle is dependent on the proper selection of sensors and the transmission of reflex data. Several academics worked on sensor-based difficulties by developing a sensor correction system and fine-tuning algorithms to regulate the system’s efficiency and precision. In this paper, the introduction of vision sensor and its scene terrain classification using a deep learning algorithm is performed with proposed datasets during sensor failure conditions. The proposed classification technique is to identify the mobile robot obstacle and obstacle-free path for smart logistic vehicle application. To analyze the information from the acquired image datasets, the proposed classification algorithm employs segmentation techniques. The analysis of proposed dataset is validated with U-shaped convolutional network (U-Net) architecture and region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) architecture model. Based on the results, the selection of 1400 raw image datasets is trained and validated using semantic segmentation classifier models. For various terrain dataset clusters, the Mask R-CNN classifier model method has the highest model accuracy of 93%, that is, 23% higher than the U-Net classifier model algorithm, which has the lowest model accuracy nearly 70%. As a result, the suggested Mask R-CNN technique has a significant potential of being used in autonomous vehicle applications.

AB  - The intelligent warehouse logistics system (IWLS) is an essential component in the emerging industry 5.0. To well assist the IWLS, advanced network architecture and control policies with the adaptive capability to the variation of traffic should be specially designed. In this paper, we consider an air-and-ground cooperative wireless network that enables dynamic coverage to support the flexible scheduling of the automatic guided vehicles (AGVs) in the IWLS. Jointly considering the dynamic deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as well as the adaptive power control of AGVs, we formulate a two time-scale network control problem to minimize the transmission power consumption of all AGVs under their individual rate requirement. On large time scales, we first propose a particle swarm optimization based algorithm (PSOA) to obtain the deployment position of the ABS. Then, using the results of the PSOA as training data, we design a deep neural network (DNN) framework aimed at reducing the computational time of the PSOA. On small time scales, we devise an online power control algorithm (OPCA) by using some of stochastic network optimization methods. With current channel conditions, the OPCA can generate the real-time power control policy and ensure the long-term rate requirement. Numerical simulations indicate that the DNN framework enhances the coverage performance of the network only consuming a few milliseconds of computation time. Incorporated with the OPCA, the total transmission power of the AGVs is significantly reduced.

AB  - The object of the paper is peculiarities of digital economy development in the framework of informatization of socio-economic, socio-cultural relations. It contributes to the in-depth development of the noosphere, the emergence of new industries and a qualitative transformation of production and distribution relations. The paper examines the impact of digitalization on transformational changes in the economy. As noted at the 14th G20 Summit, the main goals of digitalization are the development of innovations, focused on the development of society 5.0, ensuring the free flow of data and at the same time solving problems, related to information security and the protection of intellectual property rights, as well as bridging the digital gap and promoting the digitalization of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and the development of smart cities. The research methodology is based on theoretical and methodological analysis of the literature, statistical, comparative analysis, as well as synthesis, generalization and systems analysis. The study has revealed differences between the national approach and world experience in the interpretation of digitalization. For instance, in Ukraine the phenomenon involves, first of all, «digitization» in the field of data collection and analysis. At the same time, the concept of digitalization in developed countries is considered as the modernization of the manufacturing sector based on the implementation of information and communication technologies in order to reduce the capital and material intensity of products to increase competitiveness. In addition, the level of development of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) as one of the indicators of the information society has been analyzed. As a result, it was found, that about 80 % of all central banks in the world have been working on projects to issue their own digital currency. The basic requirements for national CBDC have been systematized. The practical significance, presented in the paper, lies in making recommendations for policy implementation of national economy digitalization. It is important, first of all, to «digitize» the real manufacturing sector, but not only create all sorts of «remote access services», clearly define the government position on cryptocurrencies and continue to implement the project of e-hryvnia (digital currency of National Bank of Ukraine) introduction.

AB  - Green innovation is an important way for enterprises to achieve high-quality economic development, and it is also the way to achieve the goal of double carbon. Green innovation has therefore become a research hotspot. With the acceleration of the digitalization process in equipment enterprises, intelligent manufacturing equipment enterprises located at the top of the industrial chain are in urgent need of green core technology innovation activities. In order to explore the internal mechanism of core green technology innovation, this research introduces reputation theory into the evolutionary game analysis process. By constructing an evolutionary game model between the government and intelligent manufacturing equipment enterprises, this research analyzes the dynamic factors that affect the selection and evolution of the main strategies of the players in the evaluation game. The results show that corporate reputation, core green technology innovation profit, government subsidies, government reputation, and the cost for the government to support core technology, among other factors, importantly affect the game between the government and the enterprises. At the same time, since both the government and the enterprises are affected by the initial state and the maximization of the interests of both sides of the game, it is difficult for them to spontaneously reach an ideal stable and balanced state through a virtuous circle. The greater the profits and the reputation premium the core green technology innovation brings to the enterprises, the more favorable it is for the enterprises to choose core green technology innovation; government subsidies within a certain range will also drive enterprises to choose core green technology innovation. When the value of enterprise core green technology innovation is low, the cost for the government to support core green technology innovation is lower, enterprises will lose more opportunities and decline in global competitiveness, and it will become more favorable for the government to evolve towards supporting core green technology innovation. On the contrary, the government will gradually transfer its tangible hand to the intangible hand of the market based on the consideration of subsidies, innovation costs, and reputation. The results of this research are intended to provide a theoretical basis and practical reference for Chinese intelligent manufacturing equipment enterprises to better achieve green core technology innovation.

AB  - A series of liberalization of energy market entails new entrants, users’ freedom of choice, and lowering energy prices. This will result in attrition war and rip the industries’ added values. Therefore, energy industries should create new sources of added values.Today, consumers’ interests are shifting from values of goods and services to those of “Kotozukuri”. Energy industries should take advantages of this value shift.The essential for energy industries is to aggressively collaborate with different industries, especially with ICT industries that excel in Society 5.0 for building basic models of “Energy Kotozukuri” by integrating energy supplies and users’ individual lives of energy consumptions. This could be diffused to a variety of other energy systems, and energy industries could ensure new values in the integration of energy supply and consumption.Another essential is to take advantage of Japan’s energy model. This represents world’s highest energy intensity as well as hydrocarbons’ dominance. The Japan’s model surely best fit to Asian countries.The viable strategy will be promoting the fusion of energy values, and at the same time, aggressively investing in oil’s down streams, city gas logistics, and power generation businesses in Asian arena.

AB  - To conduct, in an effective way, the non-destructive testing (NDT) of products—in particular, the fluorescent penetrant inspection (FPI)—remains a challenge. Therefore, the aim of this work is to propose the method of support in the choice of a fluorescent penetrant to be used in FPI research. In the results of the usage of the proposed procedure, it is demonstrated that it is possible to reduce the negative impacts on the environment by FPI processes (through sustainability), while including other criteria, i.e., financial, security, productive (Industry 4.0), and societal (Society 5.0) criteria. The essence of the proposed method is to integrate two methods of decision support. These were the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method and the cost–quality analysis (AKJ). Using the AHP method, the quality level of fluorescent penetrant (to the satisfaction of the customer)—which included the sustainability criteria—are calculated. These criteria include natural environment, reactivity, combustibility, level of sensitivity, and type of washing (emulsification). Then, with the help of the AKJ, the most favorable penetrant—in terms of quality and cost—is calculated and, thus, indicated. This choice must include the concept of sustainable development. Therefore, this method can be used to choose fluorescent penetrants in manufacturing and service enterprises which carry out FPI.

AB  - This chapter examines the digital transformation of Japanese business in terms of key technologies, the barriers to their expansion in Japan, and the drivers moving them forward. After clarifying definitions and discussing key technologies, the chapter discusses six sources of pressure toward digital business transformation in Japan. These pressures include overseas partners, fintech, the drop in Japanese population, generational change, and the preference for food grown in Japan. The sixth of these is a sense of innovation deeply baked into the upcoming generation that will likely impact all areas of life and business in Japan. The new generation is impatient with conventional services and feels the need for transformation as available labor decreases and aging increases demands of individuals on society. There is an additional, even though temporary, source of pressure as well – the 2020 Olympics. The sectors that are most likely to feel the impact of new digital technologies are finance, retail, manufacturing, services, agriculture, and elder care. The big question that looms in front of Japan, as with other countries, is how Japanese business and society will provide the human resources and investments needed to bring transformation to fruition.

AB  - Digital transformation and automation in the shipping industry is resulting disruptive changes to ship design, operations, and manning that aim to enhance safety, efficiency, and the environmental sustainability of maritime logistics. While there is growing research interest in these areas, examining the role of human element in the new smart shipping context is largely neglected. Through a systematic literature review, this paper aims to explore the multi-dimensional impact of autonomous shipping technology resulting from the application of Industry 4.0 and future industrial revolutions on seafarers. The impacts include the changing role of seafarers on-board and the strategies required to engage seafarers in their transition from traditional shipping to autonomous and smart shipping. The paper concludes that Industry 4.0 is being challenged for its shortfall in recognition of the importance of human role and its intelligence in the expected current industrial revolution. As a result, there is a demand to look further and beyond Industry 4.0 by introducing the next generation of industrial revolution, namely Industry 5.0. This paper suggests that the impact of this revolution in the maritime industry can be defined by concepts such as Maritime 5.0, Shipping 5.0, Seafarer 5.0, Maritime Education and Training 5.0 (MET 5.0).

As there is an increasing need for faster production and shortening of the learning curve for new emerging technologies, Virtual Reality (VR) interfaces for enterprise manufacturing DTs seem to be a good solution. Furthermore, with the emergence of Industry 5.0 (I5.0) paradigm, human operators will be increasingly integrated in the systems interfaces though advanced interactions, pervasive sensors, real time tracking and data acquisition. This scenario is especially relevant in collaborative automated systems where the introduction of immersive VR interfaces based on production cell DTs might provide a solution for the integration of the human factors in the modern industrial scenarios. This study presents experimental results of the comparison between users controlling a physical industrial robot system via a traditional teach pendant and a DT leveraging a VR user interface. The study group involves forty subjects including experts in robotics and VR as well as non-experts. An analysis of the data gathered in both the real and the virtual use case scenario is provided. The collected information includes time for performing a task with an industrial robot, stress level evaluation, physical and mental effort, and the human subjects’ perceptions of the physical and simulated robots. Additionally, operator gazes were tracked in the VR environment. In this study, VR interfaces in the DT representation are exploited to gather user centered metrics and validate efficiency and safety standards for modern collaborative industrial systems in I5.0. The goal is to evaluate how the operators perceive and respond to the virtual robot and user interface while interacting with them and detect if any degradation of user experience and task efficiency exists compared to the real robot interfaces. Results demonstrate that the use of DT VR interfaces is comparable to traditional tech pendants for the given task and might be a valuable substitute of physical interfaces. Despite improving the overall task performance and considering the higher stress levels detected while using the DT VR interface, further studies are necessary to provide a clearer validation of both interfaces and user impact assessment methods.

AB  - Abstract The O&G industry is facing big challenges which consequently raise the necessity for reforming its traditional business model and integrating digital disruptive technologies such as Digital Twins, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain. A Digital Twin(DT) is defined as a dynamic intelligent digital replica/model of the physical system/process/service/people which enables just-in-time informed decision making and root-cause analysis using AI. DTs are implanted at different levels such as Equipment/Asset Level Twin, System Level Twin, System of Systems (SoS) Level Twin. This research introduces a novel framework which is based on a Smart Secure Digital Twin (S2DT) to bridge the development gap compared to other leading industries such as manufacturing and automotive. The proposed model relies on Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) to implement edge intelligence and solve the problems of transfer latency and data overload and consequently achieves low carbon footprint. Edge Intelligence (EI) reduces energy consumption and enhances security and perspective maintenance. The Blockchain Technology is used to solve the privacy, and cybersecurity problems [4]. The Extended Reality (XR) will be used to ensure proper training of operators, and industry 5.0 to boost collaboration between human and machine. At the component level, security is maintained by integrated the locally generated intelligence on a blockchain to insure immutability, and enhance security.

AB  - Alarm management is an important task to ensure the safety of industrial process technologies. A well-designed alarm system can reduce the workload of operators parallel with the support of the production, which is in line with the approach of Industry 5.0. Using Process Mining tools to explore the operator-related event scenarios requires a goal-oriented log file format that contains the start and the end of the alarms along with the triggered operator actions. The key contribution of the work is that a method is presented that transforms the historical event data of control systems into goal-oriented log files used as inputs of process mining algorithms. The applicability of the proposed process mining-based method is presented concerning the analysis of a hydrofluoric acid alkylation plant. The detailed application examples illustrate how the extracted process models can be interpreted and utilized. The results confirm that applying the tools of process mining in alarm management requires a goal-oriented log-file design.

AB  - Local energy production for local consumption, inter-regional energy accommodation, and saving energy at home by optimal proposals for energy use are proposed as the technologies that support Society 5.0. When realizing distributed power systems by massively introducing photovoltaic power generation, residents will be not only energy consumers but energy suppliers, and thus power must be exchanged complexly in a small region. To build a power system that meets the characteristics of each region, it is necessary to predict the power consumption in the region. However, the conventional power prediction models cannot take into account the power demand structure in such a small region. In this paper, the authors tried to predict the power consumption of each small region by using the urban model that can reproduce the population dynamics there. As a result of the simulation for Yokohama City, the power consumption of each ward associated with urban dynamics could be predicted.

AB  - The paper analysis the strategies and concepts developed in the world in modern directions: innova- tive economy, digital economy, artificial intelligence, Industry 4.0 and others. The problem is to determine the initial fundamental parameters of order and their prospects in the global world, the definition and principles of artificial intel- ligence systems (AIS), its structure and important aspects and principles of future science and technology in analysis and synthesis based on synergetic approaches, innovative, information, converged technologies, taking into account the design of future and viable and safe and sustainable development in the context of Industry 4.0, digital economy (DE) and Society 5.0. The general scheme of the integrated model of sustainable and socio-humanitarian development in the global system is proposed, which the authors call the noosphere model of sustainable and safe development as an important fundamental platform for the design and creation of AIS. In the XXI century education, science and innova- tive technologies becomes the «basis» of the spiritual and material reproduction of man, transforming the society of the XXI century into an educational society, ensures compliance with the law of advanced development of human quality, quality of social intelligence and quality of educational systems in society. noosphere evolution (Субетто, 2008). Industry 4.0 is the next stage in the digitalization of production technologies with the accelerated introduction of new developments and cyberphysical systems, which is changing business models. Accordingly, Industry 4.0 as a separate segment of digital manufacturing technologies takes its place among other digital sectors. The analysis of the Strategies and Concepts developed in the world in modern directions: innovative economy, digital economy, artificial intelli- gence, Industry 4.0 and others is carried out in the work. The problem is to determine the initial fundamental para- meters of order and their prospects in the global world, the definition and principles of artificial intelligence systems (AIS), its structure and important aspects and principles of future science and technology in analysis and synthesis ba- sed on synergetic approaches, innovative, information, converged technologies, taking into account the design of future and viable and safe and sustainable development in the context of Industry 4.0, DE and Society 5.0. The main scientific and technological factors in the 21st century will be the development of: Artificial Intelligence, Nano Technologies, Bio-Media Technologies, Cognitive Technologies and Socio-Humanitarian Technologies. More specifically – this is the modern development of Innovative Technologies: «NBIC SH». Therefore, it is necessary to note the importance of taking into account the principle of I2K2+SH, ie: Intellectualization, Integration, Convergence, Coevolution and Socio- humanitarian technologies. It is important and necessary to take into account modern principles of designing a su- stainable and secure AIS and solving the problem of Harmonization between 2 worlds: Real and Virtual, especially in their hybridization. Our immediate future is a hybrid nonlinear world. Note that digitalization, artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics will be the main drivers of global economic growth by 2030E. An important paradigm and platform is the Integrated System: for Industry 4.0, DE and AI, taking into account the complex principle of I2K2+SH. If the transition of the Ukrainian economy to an innovative one does not take place in the next 3-5 years, Ukraine will remain in the backyard of civilization.

AB  - This study aims to improve the efficiency of construction efficiency to ensure the infrastructure needs of urban development. Targeting at realizing the intelligent manufacturing of buildings, the digital twins are applied to all stages of building construction, and the three-dimensional (3D) modeling is implemented. A digital twins framework in the construction field is constructed based on the building information modeling (BIM). From physical construction site entity modeling (PCSE modeling) and digital twins virtual body modeling (DTVB modeling) to virtual and real interaction modeling (VRI modeling), the digital twins process is fully applied to the various stages of building construction. The performance of the method proposed is further verified through the analysis of specific data. It is found that the model proposed shows better performance on the same platform and node compared with other models, and it shows the best scalability in the iterative calculation test on the Flink platform through efficient memory management and incremental iteration mechanism. In addition, the model has a delay of less than 100 milliseconds: in the Sleep scenario, the system delay of the latest model is about 5 times that of on the Flink, and the system interruption probability will firstly decrease and then increase when the time division factor (TDF) is increased. This study provides important reference value for the intelligent development of the construction industry and the high-quality development of buildings.

AB  - The need to restructure, redesign or develop a management model on a scientific basis at domestic petrochemical enterprises in the context of the challenges of industry 4.0 and the prospects of industry 5.0, the transition to new management standards, the lack of qualified managers determine the importance and relevance of the problem of choosing the optimal organizational structure of enterprise management that contributes to the most effective achievement of goals. When designing and evaluating the effectiveness of organizational management structures, modeling was used using the production function, which takes into account the indicators of the use of human and material capital in the organization of production. The article summarizes the research and development that allows us to assess the current level of development of organizational structures of petrochemical enterprises in domestic and foreign science and practice. It is proposed to calculate the ranges of indicators of the effectiveness of the management system, depending on the type of organizational structure of management. As a hypothesis, it is noted that with organic types of organizational structures, the level of resource saving is higher than with divisional OSU, the level of resource efficiency of which, in turn, is higher than with mechanistic OSU. The scientific results presented in the study are of significant importance in the context of the implementation of projects on strategies for the development of organizational structures of petrochemical enterprises.

AB  - Increasing volatility and product individualization are leading to higher complexity in manual assembly. At the same time, production and processes must become more flexible, and humans have to adapt to new products more often and even faster. Industry 5.0 will increasingly focus on human-centric approaches, on the collaboration of humans and machines intensively using cognitive assistance systems. The design of an innovative cognitive assistance system is a complex task due to the many technological opportunities and their interrelationships. In the framework of this research, a method was developed enabling the systematic design of cognitive assistance systems that integrates business and worker requirements aiming at improving productivity, quality, worker satisfaction and well-being. The research question was approached by design science research having, as the main output, a systematic and innovative method for the design of cognitive assistance systems based on quality function deployment (QFD), referred to as cognitive assistance system-QFD (CAS-QFD). The developed methodology is divided into six phases and includes the iterative design of a cognitive assistance system starting from the assembly process. The method considers the information needs of the workers, the definition of the appropriate assistance functions and the selection of the interaction technologies. The exemplarily industrial evaluation highlighted the relevance of CAS-QFD for systematically designing cognitive assistance systems based on holistic requirements, identified at the worker, workplace, production area and, finally, at the enterprise level.

AB  - Machine learning makes the computer able to perform without explicit programming. So, machine learning is now applied to each and every field of our daily life. The broad range of applications of machine learning are disease detection, weather forecasting, gaming, political discussion, business analytics, acoustics, agriculture, energy forecasting, genomics, etc. The advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning is a combination of tools and techniques used together to solve cognitive problems. The concepts have been effectively executed through BERT and the GPT-2 architectures. Convolutional neural network which implements depthwise separable convolution and other neural networks are also used based on the requirement of the application. Machine learning strategies used for prediction and prognosis of the COVID-19 are partial derivative regression and nonlinear machine learning. Adaptive neural fuzzy inference system is used for wind power detection in power systems. Hence, it gives richer proposals and bits of knowledge for the ensuing decisions based on past information and activities with the extreme scope of production enhancement.

AB  - The human-centered design (HCD) approach places humans at the center of design in order to improve both products and processes, and to give users an effective, efficient and satisfying interactive experience. In industrial design and engineering, HCD is very useful in helping to achieve the novel Industry 5.0 concept, based on improving workers’ wellbeing by providing prosperity beyond jobs and growth, while respecting the production limits of the planet as recently promoted by the European Commission. In this context, the paper proposes an ergonomic assessment method based on the analysis of the workers’ workload to support the design of industrial products and processes. This allows the simultaneous analysis of the physical and cognitive workload of operators while performing their tasks during their shift. The method uses a minimum set of non-invasive wearable devices to monitor human activity and physiological parameters, in addition to questionnaires for subjective self-assessment. The method has been preliminarily tested on a real industrial case in order to demonstrate how it can help companies to support the design of optimized products and processes promoting the workers’ wellbeing.

AB  - This chapter describes the structural features and problem areas of modern education systems, then discusses new social and educational ideas that offer solutions to these problems. From the nineteenth to the twenty-first century, information was given on the social models and educational systems that coincided with the turning points of industrial developments. While factory organization as characterized by mass production and nation-state citizenship shaped the education system of industrial societies, digitization and its values have left their mark on educational systems in the information society. Advanced technological developments in areas such as nanotechnology, biotechnology, or the Internet of things have led to a techno-futuristic model of society being placed on the agenda. In this context, we pursue the questions of how new technologies are changing the education system and what kind of solutions they are offering to its problems for education in future societies. New technologies are argued to have not eliminated the basic problems we must deal with in the contemporary world such as equal opportunity in education and student-centered education.

AB  - In 2002, the Brazilian Chemical Society have promoted several activities aiming to prepare a document to discuss the education in Chemistry in Brazil, the new model of research funding, the area situation and its perspectives. The document drew up diagnoses and brought up proposals that were organized into six mobilizing axes. Among its conclusions it was expected an alignment of scientific and technological research, considering the central role of Chemistry in solving problems and overcoming challenges affecting the education, full citizenship, climate changes, food production and quality, access to and quality of water, energy security, preservation of ecosystems and species, emerging diseases and quality of life. The current moment brings again challenges, imposed by a new technological generation, the transformations of the urban societies and by the commitment with a sustainable development. This article seeks to outline a panorama, using as background the Industry 4.0, the Society 5.0, the Sustainable Development Objectives, the creation of the EMBRAPII, the SENAI Institutes of Innovation and the role of the graduate programs in Chemistry, in order to construct a new agenda under the scope of the SBQ for the next 15 years.

AB  - In 2016, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced in the 2015 national tax survey that Japan's population is decreasing . In 2018, the Cabinet Office announced Society 5.0, which showed the future of Japan, "A human-centered society that realize both economic development and social issues resolve with the highly synchronized system between cyber space (virtual space) and physical space (real space). On the other hand, in 2015, the United Nations declared the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) "17 goals and 169 targets to realize a sustainable world, then leave no one behind". In Japan, in order to realize this future, measures are being taken to improve productivity in companies through work style reforms and to develop the "problem-seeking ability" of university students through educational reforms. This paper proposes next-generation artificial intelligence as the technology that solve Japan domestic problems (securing production methods to compensate for population decline) and exercise Japan leadership to contribute to the achievement of SDGs goals. This is also a proposal for a social model in which new technology realizes the happiness of all people.

AB  - The efficient exploitation of the cloud continuum (interworking of industrial cloud, edge cloud, 5G/B5G base stations, and fog node technologies) is a key factor for future Industry4.0 and beyond applications. For instance, with their ability to work more locally to data sources and to controllable actuators, cloud continuum-based solutions are considered very promising for dynamic manufacturing line control/reconfiguration and for sustainability optimizations (reduction of power and materials consumption). In these contexts, privacy, data sovereignty/control, latency, reliability, and scalability are crucial. This short paper, summarizing some key concepts from the associated keynote speech, aims at offering an overview of the concept of Digital Twins (DTs) for Industry5.0 [1] and at showing some primary and state-of-the-art solution guidelines that are emerging in the field. In particular, in our H2020 IoTwins project [2], we promote, design, implement, and evaluate Industry5.0 DTs that are both distributed because they are able to run over differentiated cloud continuum virtualized resources, also by changing their location dynamically, and hybrid because they combine data-driven machine learning models and simulations based on mathematical-physical modeling of the cyber-physical systems they represent. Distributed and hybrid DTs based on cloud continuum technologies are showing their effectiveness and efficiency in different application cases and scenarios, as demonstrated by our experience of IoTwins testbeds development.

AB  - Manufacturing systems under Industry 4.0, and their transition towards Industry 5.0, take into account the Quintuple Helix innovation model, associated with the sustainable development goals (SDGs) set by the UN and Horizon 2030, in which companies focus on operational efficiency in terms of the use and minimisation of resources for the protection of the environment. In this respect, the implementation of the circular economy model, which requires engineers to acquire appropriate competencies, enabling companies to establish this model at the manufacturing level. Moreover, competence has always been a priority for both the professional and the company. In this sense, connectivism has been called a learning theory for the digital era; this is the reason why a review of the state-of-the-art developments of this paradigm focused on engineering has been carried out. In this sense, the potential of the digital transformation in instruction to formulate an engineering model based on neuro-competences is of great interest, taking the connectivist paradigm as a methodological axis. To this end, a first bibliometric analysis has been carried out to identify the drivers on which to base the design of the neuro-competencies of the instructional engineering environment and the trend towards curriculum development under dual training models. The bibliographical research carried out on the connectivist paradigm has served to identify the trends followed to date in education within the subject area of engineering. These trends have not fully taken into account the leading role of the human factor within the socio-technical cyber-physical systems of sustainable manufacturing (SCSSM). The focus was more on the technology than on the adaptation of the uniqueness of the human factor and the tasks entrusted to him, which entails an additional complexity that needs to be addressed in both academic and professional contexts. In light of the foregoing, an improvement to the acquisition and management of competencies has been proposed to the academic, professional and dual engineering contexts. It is based on the transversal inclusion of the concept of neuro-competence applied to the competence engineering (CE) model, transforming it into the neuro-competence engineering (NCE) model. The foregoing provides a better match between the characteristics of the human factor and the uniqueness of the tasks performed by the engineer, incorporating activity theory (AT), the law of variety required (LVR), the connectivist paradigm and neuroscience as a transversal driver of innovation through fractality. This proposal enables a ubiquitous and sustainable learning model throughout the entire academic and professional life cycle of the engineer, placing it sustainably at the heart of the instructional and professional cyber-physical socio-technical system, thus complying with the SDGs set by the UN and Horizon 2030.

AB  - This chapter highlights the convergence of soft computing techniques with contemporary manufacturing and machining processes. The chapter has been divided into two subsegments, with the first one comprehensively discussing the machining processes and the integration of automation techniques in these processes. The importance and utility of computerized numerical control and part programming are interlinked with automation hardware and robotics. The extension of machining in Integrated Manufacturing Systems (IMS) with coordinated functioning of robotics and numerical control is also emphasized. The correlation of precision and Computer Integrated (Flexible) Manufacturing (CIM) cites key advantages of automation and computerized control over the conventional non-mechanized machining techniques or manual material removal operations. In the second subsegment, soft computing as a systems engineering approach has been discussed interlinking its aptness for the machining operations. The current soft computing methods including fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks (ANN), and genetic algorithms (GA) for the predictive modeling of machining operations has been elaborated in this chapter citing their utilization and significance in controlling, monitoring, and modeling these tasks. A comparison of soft computing approach for machining has also been associated with the finite element modeling (FEM) methods to outweigh the benefits of automated control and modeling in each operation, and their suitability for the specific machining tasks. The generic discussion is presented to the readers for selecting the suitable automation and modeling approach to augment certain machining tasks in the segment on computational optimization of themachining processes. The key soft computing modules are highlighted in a concluding synopsis as a mechanism for driving future process modernizations from the perspective of Industry 5.0 leveraging customer-centric digitization, advanced modeling technologies, cognitive computing, big-data management, robots, and smart machines tethered together for eco-friendly machining. The interconnected nature of the Industry 4.0-driven operations, combined with the rapid pace of digital transformation, poses a unique challenge in terms of cybersecurity, impacting businesses and their continuity and, thus, in citizens’ daily lives. The SecureIoT project introduced an open standards-based framework for IoT (Internet of Things) security, which enables IoT solution developers, integrators, and deployers to integrate and deploy secure IoT services that span multiple IoT platforms and involve networks of smart objects with embedded intelligence and semi-autonomous behavior. In addition to the implementation of the technical requirements, however, these primarily serve to provide work assistance to the people deployed in production, starting with safe and optimized processes of operators and machine setters, involving different levels within the production chain. Here, SecureIoT supports humans in adhering to the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of intime, in-quality, and in-cost maxims amidst the diversity of industrial complexity. This is exemplified by automated Machine-2-Machine (M2M) show-offs being controlled at new levels of trustworthiness, which are usually only applied to human-2-human communication. With this type of control, humans can provide a higher level of trust to the agile resource-driven automated decision-making processes for manufacturing and product security decisions. This way, SecureIoT contributes to the principles of human-centric industry and toward a secure and resilient society. Intelligent mobile robots are foreseen as one of the possible solutions to efficiently performing transportation and manipulation tasks in intelligent manufacturing systems (IMS) of Industry 4.0. In the last few decades, deep learning models have been recognized as a promising technique to enable the intelligent behavior of mobile robots for performing such tasks. For the particular problems of object detection and classification, a class of deep learning models, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), is the most widely used. This chapter presents an application of Region-based CNN (R-CNN) for advanced object identification tasks by using transfer learning. The proposed learning approach is further used for the improvement of Image- Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) algorithm used to control an intelligent mobile robot. The proposed algorithms are implemented in the MATLAB software package, and both simulation and the experimental verification of the proposed concept are performed on intelligent mobile robot, DOMINO (Deep learning Omnidirectional Mobile robot with INtelligent cOntrol). Four different CNN models are trained for object detection and classification, and the most suitable CNN model is ResNet-18, with the best recorded mean Average Precision (mAP) of 77%. Achieved experimental results show the applicability of CNN for accurate detection and classification of different manufacturing entities and the IBVS algorithm for efficient mobile robot control within IMS. The digital twin is a digital replica of physical data, processes, systems, and a digital simulation of reality, which can be used for various purposes. The concept of the digital twin provides an efficient way to cyber-physically integrate production, and optimize business processes and operational production procedures, thus achieving a new higher level of productivity. Digital twins can use data from sensors installed on physical objects to represent their status in real time, operating condition, or position. Two examples of digital twin development are presented, the first is based on static setting of a model and the second is based on dynamic setting. One of the essential criteria for smart factories, specifically for open computer numerical control (CNC) machine tool, is to bridge the gap between the physical machine tool and upper-level software applications. The difficulties are due to lack of an efficient and sufficient monitoring system. The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) and information technology overcame those issues and enabled the implementation of the industry 4.0 concept. This chapter presents a methodology and a case study on a novel implementation of an open CNC PC (personal computer)-based and service-oriented architecture-based monitoring system for Standard for Exchange of Product compliant Numerical Control (STEP-NC). The service-oriented architecture was implemented to efficiently use and manage information. The architecture is composed of four main layers: perception, communication, application, and CNC machine layer. In the perception layer, the CNC machine tool’s information is sensed via wearable devices, including two temperature sensors (infrared and thermocouple), one vibration sensor, and one electric current sensor. Then, the information is output to Node-MCU (ESP 8266) as a wireless Wi-Fi module. Under the communication layer, message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) network protocol is used to enable data transfer from device to device. The information from Node- MCU is sent wirelessly to the MQTT server through a device called Raspberry-Pi. After that, the information from the MQTT server is sent to the Application layer, which includes Node-RED and ThingSpeak. Finally, the information from the application layer is sent to the CNC machine to enable feedback in real-time, based on the machining process condition information. The completed system is then tested through two cased studies for system feasibility. The first case study is based on STEP-NC EXAMPLE 1 of Part 21 consisting features of one hole and one pocket, while case study two is based on modified STEP-NC EXAMPLE 1 of Part 21 consisting features of four holes and two pockets. Through the case study, the developed system successfully enabled data flow from CNC machine tool to upperlevel software and back to the CNC machine through an open CNC PC-based and service-oriented architecture-based monitoring system for STEP-NC. In the future, this novel development could be applied to other open CNC machine-based plug and play. Industry 4.0 has increased the potential for intelligent, broad-based, fully adaptable, autonomous, and fully accessible vision system research and industrial inspections based on the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, with technical advancements and successes. One of the key objectives of using the 3SMVI system is to significantly improve the quality of the product in the smart industries. This system precisely bridges the gap between machine vision and object dimension measurements. This chapter proposes the development of subsystems of an automated smart system based on STEP-NC for machine vision inspection - 3SMVI to detect and measure the surface feature of EXAMPLE 1 Part 21 of the ISO14649 standards. The objective of this chapter is to examine the concept of 3SMVI in the milling machine based on the camera system and lighting system to ensure the quality of the product. It discusses the complete procedure for designing a 3SMVI system to inspect the dimensions of the case study of the Delrin workpiece in real time. The pending step is to accept the requirements and conditions for the inspection. Thus, some of these criteria relate to inspecting the case study and others imposed on the industry. The appropriate selection of each essential aspect of the 3SMVI system has been presented. The Open CV library- developed system platform becomes a kind of cloud communication between the Raspberry Pi 4 board and the USB microprocessor on the principle of camera range. The cameras, lenses, lighting system, and processing platform are the significant characteristics. Finally, this chapter describes the hardware part of the 3SMVI system. More precisely, the imaging systems design and installation configuration were very compact and complete in terms of integration into a single-camera setup mounted at the top of the spindle. The empirical results shown in this chapter demonstrate that the proposed innovative calibrating technique can produce a very accurate model of the structured light sensor system. Global development requires the use of contemporary soft computing in production processes. The introduction of intelligent production processes requires the consideration of more advanced aspects in modern production technologies. In response to market demands, it is necessary to introduce advanced cutting processes that are consistent with the concept of sustainable development, and supported by modern data processing and control technologies. In this chapter, the concept of smart machining in advanced cutting processes and their soft computing-based modeling are described. A machinability evaluation framework of based on the analysis and parameterization of the advanced machining process by the selection of influencing factors and process performance indicators is shown. This activity is referred to as the necessary phase that creates the background for soft computing. The fundamentals of various soft computing techniques used in data analysis, modeling, simulation, and optimization of advanced cutting processes are presented. Minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) and High-pressure jet assisted machining (HPJAM) were analyzed as advanced machining processes. Process analysis was performed using the bio-inspired algorithm soft computing, and conclusions were drawn about the machinability, efficiency, and economy of the machining process. Natural-fiber-reinforced polymer composites are utilized in various fields, such as military, construction, packing, and sports due to their remarkable characteristics. Machining of reinforced polymer composites by using conventional machining process is too difficult and not economical and, therefore, unconventional machining plays a vital role. This chapter presents the modeling and optimization of the Abrasive water jet machining (AWJM) process on the processing of bananafiber- reinforced polymer composites (BFRPC) by using the Taguchi - JAYA method. Firstly, BFRP composites are fabricated with 5% weight by using the hand layup process. Secondly, the experimental analysis is done based on Taguchi method (L27 orthogonal array) and JAYA optimization technique to analyze the impact of processing variables, such as working pressure (WP), stand of distance (SoD), and nozzle speed (NS) on two response variables: material removal rate (MRR) and surface roughness (SR). Thirdly, parametric analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and regression analysis are carried out for fitness and statistical implications of the AWJM process using BFRP composites. The investigation results showed that the AWJM process is the most efficient technique for machining BFRC composites. JAYA algorithm is applied to determine the optimal conditions of the AWJM process. Desirability function approach (DFA) is applied to determine the overall desirability value, considering both responses (MRR and SR) that could help to evaluate the optimal conditions. JAYA algorithm determined an exceptionally high desirability value, equal to 0.9952 (close to one), for the population size and maximum number of iterations set at 60 and 40, respectively. JAYA algorithm determined optimized conditions that resulted in the following percent deviations in prediction with respect to practical experimental results: 3.2% for MRR and 7.8% for SR.

AB  - During the past decade, Industry 4.0 has greatly promoted the improvement of industrial productivity by introducing advanced communication and network technologies in the manufacturing process. With the continuous emergence of new communication technologies and networking facilities, especially the rapid evolution of cellular networks for 5 G and beyond, the requirements for smarter, more reliable, and more efficient cellular network services have been raised from the Industry 5.0 blueprint. To meet these increasingly challenging requirements, proactive and effective allocation of cellular network resources becomes essential. As an integral part of the cellular network resource management system, cellular traffic prediction faces severe challenges with stringent requirements for accuracy and reliability. One of the most critical problems is how to improve the prediction performance by jointly exploring the spatial and temporal information within the cellular traffic data. A promising solution to this problem is provided by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which can jointly leverage the cellular traffic in the temporal domain and the physical or logical topology of cellular networks in the spatial domain to make accurate predictions. In this paper, we present the spatial-temporal analysis of a real-world cellular network traffic dataset and review the state-of-the-art researches in this field. Based on this, we further propose a time-series similarity-based graph attention network, TSGAN, for the spatial-temporal cellular traffic prediction. The simulation results show that our proposed TSGAN outperforms three classic prediction models based on GNNs or GRU on a real-world cellular network dataset in short-term, mid-term, and long-term prediction scenarios.

AB  - Today’s Industry 4.0 (I4) is re-designing industrial activities and re-shaping communities into the so-called Society 5.0 (S5), enabling the creation of a new industry-societyenvironment nexus. The application of novel technologies such as pervasive sensing, widespread internet of the things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and robotics aims to sense, calculate, and actuate by employing data-driven architectures and automated decisions for reaching more efficient processes that reduce environmental impacts and transform manpower workloads. This work introduces a cyber-physical system (CPS) towards more innovative operations within the mining industry’s mine-to-mill process, whereby the operations’ decision-making and executions are often done by human intelligence. However, the increasing use of autonomous machines or mechatronics (MEC) such as trucks, drills, drones, and conveyor belts, combined with advanced modelling and solving algorithms (MSA), can achieve the necessary autonomous operations for handling such hazards and harsh environments, where no or reduced manpower is required. For that, information and computing technologies (ICT) facilitate innovative solutions to re-shape and re-design production systems. The interplaying of advanced technologies of the I4 mandate and circular economy (CE) ideology towards the mines of the future creates a smart connected mining industry that embeds vast amounts of data into predictive and fully integrated intelligent systems. This paper discusses how I4’s technological developments in mining sector applications generate opportunities to re-design and re-execute stockpiling to conveyor-belt processes into enhanced production states from a CE perspective (environmental, economic, and social). CE theories within I4-S5 offer innovative sustainable industrial concepts driven by safer, more environmentally friendly towards precision and autonomous mining.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the role of innovation competitive advantage on strategic orientation dimensions of (entrepreneurial orientation, market orientation, and resource orientation) on the sustainable growth of SMEs. This study used a total of 217 responses adopting the cross-sectional survey research design from manufacturing SMEs owners/founders. The results were analysed using PLS-SEM via SmartPLS version 3.3.3. The major findings established that entrepreneurial orientation did not directly link with the sustainable growth of SMEs. The study confirmed that market orientation and resource orientation revealed a direct and significant positive link with the sustainable growth of SMEs. Similarly, innovation competitive advantage has a direct significant positive association with the sustainable growth of SMEs. Likewise, entrepreneurial orientation and market orientation have a direct and significant positive relationship with innovation competitive advantage. However, resource orientation did not significantly relate to innovation competitive advantage. The findings validated that innovation competitive advantage mediated the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation, market orientation, and the sustainable growth of SMEs. Finally, innovation competitive advantage did not mediate between resource orientation and sustainable growth of SMEs, which have not previously been proven in empirical studies. This study was designed to address the existing gaps and provide reasons to prove them. This study is indeed one of the remarkable studies in the context of SMEs, which integrates these selected variables into a single model. The originality focused on the role of innovation competitive advantage on strategic orientation dimensions and sustainable growth of SMEs that are relevant to Society 5.0.

AB  - The fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, is reshaping the way individuals live and work while providing a substantial influence on the manufacturing scenario. The key enabling technology that has made Industry 4.0 a concrete reality is without doubt collaborative robotics, which is also evolving as a fundamental pillar of the next revolution, the so-called Industry 5.0. The improvement of employees’ safety and well-being, together with the increase of profitability and productivity, are indeed the main goals of human-robot collaboration (HRC) in the industrial setting. The robotic controller design and the analysis of existing decision and control techniques are crucially needed to develop innovative models and state-of-the-art methodologies for a safe, ergonomic, and efficient HRC. To this aim, this paper presents an accurate review of the most recent and relevant contributions to the related literature, focusing on the control perspective. All the surveyed works are carefully selected and categorized by target (i.e., safety, ergonomics, and efficiency), and then by problem and type of control, in presence or absence of optimization. Finally, the discussion of the achieved results and the analysis of the emerging challenges in this research field are reported, highlighting the identified gaps and the promising future developments in the context of the digital evolution. Note to Practitioners—The design and development of manufacturing systems are experiencing substantial changes towards full automation. This ongoing challenge is being tackled by academia and industrial practitioners with the adoption of collaborative robots, where the skills and peculiarities of humans (e.g., intelligence, creativity, adaptability, etc.) and robots (e.g., flexibility, pinpoint accuracy, tirelessness, etc.) are combined to better perform a variety of tasks. Nevertheless, due to their different characteristics, there is an emerging need for designing suitable decision and control techniques to ensure a safe and ergonomic HRC, while keeping the highest level of productivity. Against this background, the aim of this paper is to provide researchers and practitioners with a reference source in the related field, which can help them designing and developing suitable solutions to control problems in safe, ergonomic, and efficient collaborative robotics.

AB  - Abstract  The methodology of adult learning has changed significantly. Today, it is no longer possible to consider it a homogeneous group of trainees with a significant age difference. Different methods and tools are available to acquire knowledge. Digital technology, changes in time management, and changes in the way information is processed require new methods in adult learning. The acquisition of knowledge is necessary to enable workers to contribute to the digitization of the operating characteristics of production equipment and machinery in the context of Industry 4.0 and, on the other hand, to enable the combination of robotic and human skills to be launched in the 21 st century through Industry 5.0. In our research, we examine the perspectives of adult education institutions, adult education professionals, and the people involved in adult education to ameliorate the use of digital technology in adult education as effectively as possible. We looked at the readiness and openness of institutions and trainers and the digital competencies and expectations of adult learning users of different generations. With our research, we got to know the situation of adult education enterprises operating in Hungary, in the Békés County, the needs and learning habits of different generations, and determined the directions of digital competence development in adult education.

AB  - Modern development of the noosphere, the emergence of new industries and a qualitative transformation of production and distribution relations are determined by widespread digitalization throughout the world. The main goals of digitalization are the development of innovations focused on the development of society 5.0, ensuring the free flow of data and capital. Considering the Mundell-Fleming model application as the instrument to support economic welfare it should be admitted the “impossible trinity” of the model and the lack of research to solve it. The paper investigates the Mundell-Fleming dilemma solution on the ground of digitalization. The research methodology is based on fundamental tenets of modern economics and general scientific methods, namely: induction, deduction, dialectical method and systematic approach, analysis and synthesis – all of these for analyzing the process of digitalization and to establish the principles, forms and foundations of the Mundell-Fleming model application in the digital dimension, systematization and generalization (to substantiate the phenomenon of digitalization), abstract-logical method (for recent tendencies substantiation), economic-mathematical (to compare and analyze data), institutional-comparative (for the analysis Mundell-Fleming model application in the digital economy). The paper studies the Mundell-Fleming model application in digital economy, it investigates global trends as well as peculiarities of digitalization in Ukrainian economy. We believe digitalization is the instrument to solve the Mundell-Fleming trilemma. The study reveals trends of banking digitalization as external as internal.

AB  - This work arises as a reflection on what it means to be a designer of the future and their greater need for influence and collaboration with the team throughout the product creation cycle. The renewal of a culture of design and business innovation in the area of fashion and textile design is based on the establishment of bridges with different realities that, increasingly dynamic, change the landscape of different products and their creation processes, blurring the boundaries and limits of each area of intervention and its actors. From the small to the big industry we find new needs and professions that project themselves into the future reaching from the past, as in the case of new craft productions that value the identity, artistic and cultural heritage of each geography, supported by new materials and technologies of Industry 5.0. This new dynamic of integrated work, where everyone contributes to enhance the knowledge of each participant, enabling the renewal of knowledge and the development of innovation and social, cultural, and economic inclusion, needs greater support and connection between academia and the creative and productive reality on the ground. The present research group, sustained by the interpretation of the paths of work innovation in the coming decades, intended to provide a contribution to the industry and the culture of national or international design innovation, through research based on the identification of the knowledge and skills necessary for the future training of fashion designers.The adoption of a qualitative and quantitative methodology should allow the collection of data that can indicate trends of needs of future designers and the need to adapt the academy to these new realities. With this study we intend to establish a network of relationships between the different actors in the process of creation and innovation, as well as promote a greater connection between the different forms of creation and production that allow to satisfy the final consumer and their needs around fashion and textiles.

AB  - The Digital Transformation (DX) megatrend is fundamentally disrupting and changing the nature of work, business, and industry at a rapid pace. Although the notion of DX has garnered much research interest from practitioners, scholarship on this topic is somehow lagging behind, possibly because of the lack of theoretical frameworks on DX. Recently, most Japanese firms have begun to use diverse digital technologies to sustain their competitive advantages. However, the return of investment on digital technologies has not been as high as expected for some firms. Furthermore, as the visions of Industry 5.0 describe sustainable, resilient, and human-centered future factories that will require smart and resilient capabilities both from next-generation manufacturing systems and human operators, it is necessary to design resilient human–machine collaborations within factories. To this end, this paper presents a research model between DX technologies and scientific problem-solving in terms of deduction, induction, and abduction inference structures as an approach to resilient human–machine collaborations. The purpose of this research is to analyze the difference in the utilization pattern of the digital technology of American, German, and Japanese firms based on three types of decision-making methods. Next, we apply this framework in a comparative case study of two Japanese firms and one German firm, where we find that there is a difference in DX technologies utilization among the Japanese and German firms. We assert that the utilization of IoT technology in the United States and Germany is pursuing IoT with the aim of autonomous control, whereas Japanese firms prioritize robot–human collaboration. Finally, we discuss how our findings contribute to the burgeoning field of resilient human–machine collaborations by showing the distinct roles of deduction, induction, and abduction inference structures. Furthermore, our research contributes to international comparative studies to identify the difference in national IT utilization. Lessons and implications are discussed.

AB  - In light of the Industry 5.0 trend towards human-centric and resilient industries, human-robot collaboration (HRC) assembly lines can be used to enhance productivity and workers’ well-being, provided that the optimal allocation of tasks and available resources can be determined. This study investigates the assembly line balancing problem (ALBP), considering HRC. This problem, abbreviated ALBP-HRC, arises in advanced manufacturing systems, where humans and collaborative robots share the same workplace and can simultaneously perform tasks in parallel or in collaboration. Driven by the need to solve the more complex assembly line-balancing problems found in the automotive industry, this study aims to address the ALBP-HRC with the cycle time and the number of operators (humans and robots) as the primary and secondary objective, respectively. In addition to the traditional ALBP constraints, the human and robot characteristics, in terms of task times, allowing multiple humans and robots at stations, and their joint/collaborative tasks are formulated into a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. A neighborhood-search simulated annealing (SA) is proposed with customized solution representation and neighborhood search operators designed to fit into the problem characteristics. Furthermore, the proposed SA features an adaptive neighborhood selection mechanism that enables the SA to utilize its exploration history to dynamically choose appropriate neighborhood operators as the search evolves. The proposed MILP and SA are implemented on real cases taken from the automotive industry where stations are designed for HRC. The computational results over different problems show that the adaptive SA produces promising solutions compared to the MILP and other swarm intelligence algorithms, namely genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and artificial bee colony. The comparisons of human/robot versus HRC settings in the case study indicate significant improvement in the productivity of the assembly line when multiple humans and robots with collaborative tasks are permissible at stations.

AB  - Several studies have pointed out that Human factors are one of the main significant challenges in the development of the Factory of the Future (FoF). We speak now of Industry 5.0: industry 4.0 with the emphasis of ecology and human aspects. In this context the aim of this paper is to present the new issues for worker’s health and safety which have to be taken into account as soon as possible in the workplace design process and its use. We are speaking of “integrated prevention” which has to be applied from the system requirements to the functional design and the architectural design. Deployment of new technologies and organizations in the frame of FoF introduces hazardous events, problems of health and safety which have to be taken into account in the different life situations. The identification of dangerous situations therefore requires investigation of identification of characteristic design parameters related to risk qualification for the operator tasks. We start from the basic idea that accident is the interaction between a dangerous device and the worker, that can be directly linked to the generalized energy in a defined space. Each energy is characterized by parameters related to hazards for which the severity is defined by the standards and regulations. The methodology proposed combines a generic design approach based on a systems engineering approach to identify the uses that operators will make to ensure production requirements, and an energy approach for identifying potential hazards.

AB  - Industrialisation remains the major factor of development in the era of radical changes. Its drivers – advanced digital production technologies – are transforming the entire industrial and spatial landscape. Industrial regions take a special role in these transformations. The research aims to identify trends in the development of basic industries in industrial regions and work out a method to form their new technological image. Methodologically, the study relies on the institutional theory, theories of sustainable and longterm technical and economic development; applies methods of comparative, statistical, structural analysis and neural network modelling. Considering the case of the Ural metal industries, the study reveals the main trends of development and possibilities of forming the image of future of the basic industries of Russia’s industrial regions, as well as specifies the factors that modify these trends under the New Normal. Due to institutional and technological transformations, the Russian metal industries have achieved impregnable positions in the world market. The paper substantiates the changes in the development of the basic industries linked with the formation of Industry 5.0 as the new management paradigm, which assigns priority to the ESG factors. The research demonstrates that an indispensable condition for the successful functioning of companies is the ability to cooperate and agree on decisions. The findings confirm that modernised metal and other basic industries through integrating green, digital and behavioural economy will not only maintain, but are likely to increase their importance in the economy of industrial regions.

AB  - This article presents an idea of achieving reliability through Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for industrial power systems. It proposes hybrid approach for predictive and corrective maintenance. It discusses the self-corrective maintenance (SCM) paradigm as hybrid approach for industrial power systems along with condition-based maintenance approach utilizing IIoT to achieve it. As it is well known that industries pay huge penalty for the down time, and suffer to meet reliability demands for years. Study witnesses its cost in millions of dollars yearly for production disruptions. It can be prevented by proactively following the aggressive maintenance schedule. However, it often becomes expensive as part or service may not be utilized for its full life and failure may occur even in middle of maintenance cycle. On the other hand, condition-based maintenance (CBM) helps utilize the full life and prevents the downtime by predicting the failures ahead. This article reviews current maintenance practices followed by industry leaders and a proposal on self-corrective maintenance based on condition of restorable resources. It is about learning the condition of subsystems by itself and taking corrective action when subsystem is not active. This concept helps reduce manual intervention to correct the problem as well as the maintenance cost. This research also covers the self-uncorrectable issues to be handled by proactively following CBM process through IIoT. This hybrid proposal could be a significant gear shift in maintenance direction for general industry as well as power systems. It can be termed as industry's 5th revolution or Industry 5.0.

AB  - Industry 5.0 is rapidly growing as the next industrial evolution, aiming to improve production efficiency in the 21st century. This evolution relies mainly on advanced digital technologies, including Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), by deploying multiple IIoT devices within industrial systems. Such a setup increases the possibility of threats, especially with the emergence of IIoT botnets. This can provide attackers with more sophisticated tools to conduct devastating IIoT attacks. Besides, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are considered as powerful techniques to efficiently detect IIoT attacks. However, the centralized way in building learning models and the lack of up-to-date datasets that contain the main attacks are still ongoing challenges. In this context, multiaccess edge computing (MEC) and federated learning (FL) are two promising complementary technologies. MEC brings computing capabilities at the edge of the industrial systems, while FL leverages the edge resources to enable a privacy-aware collaborative learning, especially in multiindustrial systems context. In this article, we design a novel MEC-based framework to secure IIoT applications leveraging FL, called FedGame. Specifically, FedGame enables multiple MEC domains to collaborate securely to deal with an IIoT attack, while preserving the privacy of IIoT devices. Moreover, a noncooperative game is formulated on the top of FedGame, to enable MEC nodes acquiring the needed virtual resources from the centralized MEC orchestrator, to deal with each type of IIoT attacks. We evaluate FedGame using real-world IIoT attacks; the experimental results show not only the accuracy of FedGame against centralized ML/DL schemes while preserving the privacy of Industrial systems but also its efficiency in providing required MECs resources and, thus, dealing with IIoT attacks.

AB  - Digitalization is rushing throughout the world, namely, in industrial and societal infrastructures. Hence, digital transformation becomes a pillar of industrial policy, known in Europe as “Industry 4.0,” in China as “made in China 2025,” in Asia as “Smart Cities,” in Japan as “Society 5.0,” and in North America as “Industrial Internet.” These transformations will change the industrial landscape, toward Quality 4.0 and therefore, our lives. The presented research was conducted on quality management employees in Portugal and it aims to analyze if such employees have the perception of the impact of Industry 4.0 in the quality management profession and the required and needed skills. After analyzing the answered questionnaires, 90 results were considered valid. This is the sample of our study. Simultaneously, the goal of this research is also to review and analyze the main topics in progress related to quality management for the fourth industrial revolution and how quality emerges of this change. The professionals that work on quality management must have creative thinking, be leaders, know how to communicate and work as a team, as well as, to have knowledge and understanding of ICT (Information and Communications Technology), and main pillars of Industry 4.0. These are the main findings. Besides that, they must know how to motivate their work teams, be open to change, know how to use Big Data to make decisions and above all, they must know how to manage conflicts. In addition, quality professionals must promote the design and production of first class products, be the defenders of their customers within the organization, and finally, they must create value for the stakeholders.

AB  - Problem and goal. The actual problem of digitalization means, degree and consequences of influence on fostering public and personal opinion in society is considered in the article. The purpose of the study was to show that digitalization is qualitatively changing some aspects of social life. Methodology. Determination of digitalization means, degree and consequences of influence on some aspects of social life was carried out by analysis of work results of some sites/portals devoted to events of World War II. Results. Digitalization nowadays is a process being quickly spread all around the world. It covers a wide range of human activities: business, industry, agriculture, education, healthcare, culture and social life. The process being very new, complex and challenging demands developing of a high (state) level strategy such as “ Industrie 4.0” - one of ten projects for State Hi-Tech Strategy of Germany up 2020 or “Digital Economy of the Russian Federation”. Moreover it becomes obvious that digitalization influences not only “production” but also society. In 2016 Japan released concept “Society 5.0” - a large plan of social transformations. Interesting and remarkable results in fostering some aspects of social life were also reached in the Russian Federation during preparation of Great Victory 75th anniversary celebration. Conclusion. It is demonstrated that massive digitalization of personal archives (photos, documents, family/participant of events stories, eyewitness accounts) as well as access to archived data of state institutions and possibility to translate all information for free has fostered qualitatively new personal and social attitude to remarkable historical events.

AB  - Abstract— Through the Research and Community Service Institute (LPPM), Atma Jaya University Yogyakarta carries out the Community Service 5.0 program which focuses on community service programs through courageous means without direct contact with local residents, with a bold overall mechanism process, starting from taking, program, to implementation of the work program. The KKN 49 group was located in Sabdodadi Village, Kapanewon Bantul, Bantul Regency, Sepecial Region of Yogyakarta. Sabdodadi village has several potentials, such as cultural potential, tourism potential, and natural resource potential (SDA). Based on the potential of existing natural resources, the KKN 49 group will make village potentials regarding "Processing the Production of Banana Fruits in Sabdodadi Village into Banana Nuggets". Utilization of this potential is expected to improve the village economy through the culinary industry. The group also found data where from 2019 to 2020 there was a decrease in the number of tourist attraction visitors so that their income also decreased. In addition, there was a decline in the production value of the clothing and leather industry. So to boost the economy of the clothing and leather industry, the KKN 49 group made a pocket book on "How to Marketing Leather Crafts Online with Instagram Business and Whatsapp Business". Abstrak— Melalui lembaga penelitian dan Pengabdian masyarakat (LPPM) Universitas Atma Jaya Yogyakarta mengusung program KKN Society 5.0 yang berfokus pada program pengabdian masyarakat melalui sarana daring tanpa adanya kontak seccara langsung dengan warga sekitar, dengan proses mekanisme keseluruhan secara daring, mulai dari pengambila, penentuan program, hingga pelaksanaan pembuatan program kerja. Kelompok KKN 49 mendapatkan lokasi di Desa Sabdodadi, Kapanewon Bantul, Kabupaten Bantul, Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta. Desa Sabdodadi memiliki beberapa potensi, seperti potensi budaya, potensi wisata, dan potensi sumber daya alam (SDA). Berdasarkan potensi sumber daya alam yang ada, kelompok KKN 49 akan membuat potensi desa tentang “Pengolahan Hasil Produksi Buah Pisang Desa Sabdodadi menjadi Nugget Pisang”. Pemanfaatan potensi ini diharapkan dapat meningkatkan perekonomian desa melalui industri kuliner. Kelompok juga menemukan data di mana pada tahun 2019 sampai tahun 2020 terjadi penurunan jumlah pengunjung objek wisata sehingga pendapatannya juga menurun.

AB  - The article considers the peculiarities of doing business in the COVID-19 pandemic. It is proved that with the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic the number of operating enterprises in Ukraine increased by 1,65%. At the same time, the number of unprofitable enterprises increased by 28,6%. Odesa oblast, Kirovohrad oblast and Kyiv are the regions most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine. It is determined that the loss of profits from the COVID-19 pandemic in large enterprises is 10-25%, and in small enterprises 25-50%. It is proved that the declining trend of profitability of operating activities of domestic enterprises accelerated further in the COVID-19 pandemic and reached 3,9% in 2020. Quarantine restrictions imposed in Ukraine led to the suspension of domestic enterprises, which faced additional problems. Among such problems are: the need to restructure the current business model of enterprises, reduce staff, increase production costs, reduce sales and other problems. It was found that smart companies did not face the problems of business organization and profitability under quarantine restrictions. Such enterprises timely fully "digitized" business processes based on modern information and communication technologies and other technologies of Industry 5.0; have high innovation activity; in the structure of the enterprise created its own research laboratory for the implementation of innovative developments; are energy and cost saving; constantly reduce the time of launch of a new product on the market, improve product quality. Examples of efficient and profitable domestic smart enterprises in various industries are given. For example, smart enterprises in the field of insurance increased the number of contracts concluded in Ukraine for compulsory civil liability insurance of vehicle owners in electronic form by 3,2 times compared to 2019; Retail enterprises increased the share of sales via the Internet by 2,1%, non-cash payments increased by 36% of the total retail trade in Ukraine.

AB  - From 2010, English local authority budgets for social care were drastically reduced due to financial difficulties, and policies that produced the maximum cost effectiveness were required. The Department of Health (DH, now DHSC) asked the Health & Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC, now NHS Digital), a non-departmental public body, to co-produce a new social care data framework that better measures the results. This was an unprecedented new data production project, the Zero-Based Review (ZBR).The ZBR project is divided into five areas: (a) Safe Guarding Stakeholder Group, (b) EQ-CL Stakeholder Group, (c) SALT (Short and Long Term support) Stakeholder Group, (d) ASC-FR (Adult Social Care Finance Return) Stakeholder group, (e) Communications group.Traditional data shows the support system and status, such as the number of service users and the number of supports provided, but the SALT data shows the state after the care assessment. New items such as leading to independence, leading to long-term support, transition to end-of-life care, refusal of support, etc. have been added. The ZBR project emphasized “outcomes” rather than traditional service “structures” or “processes” so that the data collected can improve the practice of delivering social care support. Some of the data is reflected in the Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework (ASCOF), an important indicator set of local government achievements in social care policies and practices. The ZBR project started in 2011, and the data was constructed over several years. The data items are still being revised as appropriate in response to the revision of the law and social care policy.We believe that examining this new construction effort for social care data in England will also be helpful for Japan, which is currently working on the realization of a “data-driven society” in society 5.0.

AB  - This time we start with several papers regarding the new wave of the Digital Era and the ICT Revolution, starting with the general Framework of Global and Remote Communication that represents on the context of an expanding Globalization the way we are opening to a new world with great opportunities, but that also brings some risks like the Moral Challenges of the advanced technologies of the 4th Industrial Revolution, that hopefully may be overcome in the 5th Industrial Revolution with the kind of Society 5.0 that is emerging in Japan. Moreover, advances in the Digital Era may also foster citizenship development as shown in the next paper; but at the same time represent a challenge regarding professional skills needed in particular for startups that are growing rapidly in number and size everywhere; so this is context of the next paper. Next paper is a study on the Quality of Life at work based on Leadership Models that in particular shows the positive impacts of a more Participatory Leadership. Next paper shows, through a survey of 396 companies in Brazil, that only a small number of organizations deal with the process of retaining professionals identified as potential successors that no doubt could be very relevant for the organization. Regarding Human Resources next paper is a study based on a Semantic Analysis about possibilities that are opening already, at the recruitment and selection process, by using Artificial Intelligence. Next paper seeks to find relationships between motivation and engagement and project management by means of a bibliometric analysis. For this purpose, was performed a cluster analysis of 529 articles using VOXviewer indicated that motivation in projects is strongly linked to professional development and growth, with increased interest in sustainability and in the relationship with stakeholders represented by the internal and external community of projects; and regarding Organizational Culture next paper shows, through a survey of 109 Organizations in Brazil, the importance of integrating Cultural Diversity in Organizations that may not only help to improve social conditions but also lead to recruiting better talents and leads to greater customer orientation, greater employee satisfaction and better decision making representing a win-win strategy. Still regarding Organizational Culture, and based on Quinn and Rohrbaugh’s model, next paper focus impacts on Competitive Strategy in the Banking Segment following Quinn and McGrath approach. Next paper is a statistical study regarding Fidelity in the Physical Fitness Business, using Logistic Regression and unidirectional ANOVA, that surprisingly show that frequency of use was the most relevant variable related to customer retention, rather than price and membership length. Today’s economic impacts of COVID-!9 is leading Public Policies in Governments like Brazil to drastically reduce Investments in Science and Technology that may end up decreasing the Human Development Index – HDI, as shown by next paper based on a previous study of the performance indicators in Science, Technology and Innovation CT&I in 14 countries including some like Brazil. Today, 55% of the world's population lives in urban areas, a proportion that is expected to increase to 68% by 2050; as a matter of fact by 2050, two-thirds of all humanity will live in urban areas; and higher changes have actually been in Latin America and the Caribbean with 81.2% of the population already living in urban areas, up from 41.3% in 1950. Hence particularly in these regions sustainable development will become fundamental for the management of cities, so next paper dealing with a small city in southern Brazil may be helping as Best Practice Case. The city was able, through Team Works, to developed a Municipal Goals Plan based on the Sustainable Development Goals - SDG and in less than 4 years (2017-2020) 90% of which were reached through Work Teams driven basically by: The engagement of those responsible for2RISUS – Journal on Innovation and Sustainability, São Paulo, v. 12, n.2, p. 1-3, abr./mai. 2021 - ISSN 2179-3565Administrative Management, The importance of planning, at both strategic and operational levels, and the commitment of the teams in the execution of the actions. Actually, Brazil for some time has being already counting with an Open Sustainable Cities Program that help cities to develop its own strategies accordingly. Next paper is a survey of 48 companies in Brazil that using Crunchbase and Iramuteq technologies found three classes of business blockchain impact on Business models: A distributed value structure, a governance structure and an application structure aimed at encrypted and tokens. Next paper coming from Ukraine shows an approach for modelling a System of Balanced Criteria of Business Process Management (BPM), focused on large data volumes with a basic processes implemented using the cloud computing service — math.semestr, that may be promising in terms of automation of business process management. Last paper comes from Malaysia and deals with a trial on Home Buyers´ Willingness to Pay (WTP), using an on-line survey constructed using the LMA design tool provided in the ‘support.CEs’ package that showed that even a small and diversified sample of 20 respondents dealing with home buyer preferences for sustainable housing and analyzed using the package’s clogit function may give some results even for the measurement of a higher number of variables.
