2061,pub.1150587048,10.3390/en15176276,,,A Literature Review of the Challenges and Opportunities of the Transition from Industry 4.0 to Society 5.0,"In the era of Industry 4.0, manufacturing and production systems were revolutionized by increasing operational efficiency and developing and implementing new business models, services, and products. Concretely, the milestone set for Industry 4.0 was to improve the sustainability and efficiency of production systems. By extension, the emphasis was focused on both the digitization and the digitalization of systems, providing room for further improvement. However, the current technological evolution is more system/machine-oriented, rather than human-oriented. Thus, several countries have begun orchestrating initiatives towards the design and development of the human-centric aspect of technologies, systems, and services, which has been coined as Industry 5.0. The impact of Industry 5.0 will extend to societal transformation, which eventually leads to the generation of a new society, the Society 5.0. The developments will be focused on the social and human-centric aspect of the tools and technologies introduced under the framework of Industry 4.0. Therefore, sustainability and human well-being will be at the heart of what comes next, the Industry 5.0, as a subset of Society 5.0. Industry 5.0 will build on the foundations laid during Industry 4.0 by emphasizing human-centered, resilient, and sustainable design. Consequently, the authors in this research work, through a critical literature review, aim to provide adequate reasoning for considering Industry 5.0 as a framework for enabling the coexistence of industry and emerging societal trends and needs. The contribution of this research work extends to the provision of a framework to facilitate the transition from Industry 4.0 to Society 5.0.",,Energies,,,2022-08-28,2022,2022-08-28,,15,17,6276,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mourtzis, Dimitris; Angelopoulos, John; Panopoulos, Nikos","Mourtzis, Dimitris (); Angelopoulos, John (); Panopoulos, Nikos ()",,"Mourtzis, Dimitris (); Angelopoulos, John (); Panopoulos, Nikos ()",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/17/6276/pdf?version=1662429972,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150587048,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

A resilient manufacturing strategy based on the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks plays an essential role in facilitating production and supply chain recovery. IIoT contains confidential data and private information, and many security issues arise through vulnerabilities in the infrastructure. The traditional centralized IIoT framework is not only of high cost for system configuration but also vulnerable to cyber-attacks and single-point failure, which is not suitable for achieving the resilient manufacturing vision in Industry 5.0. Recently, researchers are seeking a secure solution of middleware based on blockchain technology integration for decentralized IIoT, which can effectively protect the consistency, integrity, and availability of IIoT data by utilizing the auditing and tamper-proof features of the blockchain. This paper presented a review of secure blockchain middleware for decentralized IIoT towards Industry 5.0. Firstly, the security issues of conventional IIoT solutions and the advantages of blockchain middleware are analyzed. Secondly, an architecture of secure blockchain middleware for decentralized IIoT is proposed. Finally, enabling technologies, challenges, and future directions are reviewed. The innovation of this paper is to study and discuss the distributed blockchain middleware, investigating its ability to eliminate the risk of a single point of failure via a distributed feature in the context of resilient manufacturing in Industry 5.0 and to solve the security issues from traditional centralized IIoT. Also, the four-layer architecture of blockchain middleware presented based on the IIoT application framework is a novel aspect of this review. It is expected that the paper lays a solid foundation for making IIoT blockchain middleware a new venue for Industry 5.0 research.",,Machines,,,2022-09-26,2022,2022-09-26,,10,10,858,All OA; Gold,Article,"Leng, Jiewu; Chen, Ziying; Huang, Zhiqiang; Zhu, Xiaofeng; Su, Hongye; Lin, Zisheng; Zhang, Ding","Leng, Jiewu (); Chen, Ziying (); Huang, Zhiqiang (); Zhu, Xiaofeng (); Su, Hongye (); Lin, Zisheng (); Zhang, Ding ()",,"Leng, Jiewu (); Chen, Ziying (); Huang, Zhiqiang (); Zhu, Xiaofeng (); Su, Hongye (); Lin, Zisheng (); Zhang, Ding ()",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1702/10/10/858/pdf?version=1664197399,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151433129,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

This is driving companies to abandon classic methods and turn to the use of innovative concepts as manners to promote sustainability and resilience. One of these concepts is Industry 5.0, which, according to the European Commission, focuses on sustainable manufacturing and operator well-being and complements Industry 4.0 as it seeks to improve factory efficiency through technology by placing the human being at the center of development. At the same time, it minimizes environmental and social impacts and enhances resilience. Aware that implementing these new trends is a challenge for MSMEs, this study contributes to the generation of indicators to evaluate elements of Industry 5.0 in the textile production of MSMEs, supporting the development and implementation of strategies focused on this area. The construction of the set of indicators is based on a 3-phase framework that consists of doing a systematic literature review, selecting the indicators by a process of analysis and comparison, and expanding their characteristics through elaborating data sheets.

1658,pub.1147301480,10.3233/atde220158,,,Exploring Data-Driven Decision-Making for Enhanced Sustainability,"The industry transition towards digital transformation opens the possibilities to utilize data for enhancing sustainability in industrial operations and build capabilities towards resilient and circular operations, i.e., shift towards industry 5.0. This paper explores how data-driven decision-making (DDDM) can enable sustainable and resilient supply chain operations within the manufacturing industry. A series of in-depth interviews were conducted with experts, researchers, and company representatives across the manufacturing industry and universities in Sweden. The findings show a consensus among companies, researchers, and literature about the potential of data utilization for sustainability purposes; however, in most cases, the complete transformation towards data-driven has not happened yet. Companies have uncertainty about what data is needed rather than its lack. Reliability & validity of data become essential to exploit the potential of the data organizations already possess. Based on the literature and interview data, a conceptual model is proposed, including three identified parameters connected to DDDM, 1) data and IT infrastructure, 2) current operations, and 3) an improved triple bottom line performance. The model captures the interconnections between such parameters, depicting the benefits and challenges of DDDM and its relation to more sustainable and resilient supply chain operations within the manufacturing industry. In a data-driven approach, real-time analysis of complex & extensive amounts of data gives unlimited possibilities to improve manufacturing operations through decision-making.",,Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering,SPS2022,,2022-04-20,2022,2022-04-20,,,,,All OA; Gold,Chapter,"Chavez, Zuhara; Gopalakrishnan, Maheshwaran; Nilsson, Viktor; Westbroek, Arvid","Chavez, Zuhara (KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Department of Sustainable Production Development, Södertälje, Sweden); Gopalakrishnan, Maheshwaran (KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Department of Sustainable Production Development, Södertälje, Sweden); Nilsson, Viktor (KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Department of Industrial economics and management, Stockholm, Sweden); Westbroek, Arvid (KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Department of Industrial economics and management, Stockholm, Sweden)",,"Chavez, Zuhara (Royal Institute of Technology); Gopalakrishnan, Maheshwaran (Royal Institute of Technology); Nilsson, Viktor (Royal Institute of Technology); Westbroek, Arvid (Royal Institute of Technology)",0,0,,,https://ebooks.iospress.nl/pdf/doi/10.3233/ATDE220158,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147301480,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems","11 Sustainable Cities and Communities; 12 Responsible Consumption and Production; 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Digital twin (DT), referring to the virtual representation of a physical object, is well-perceived as a key driver in the development of PI-based Supply Chain Management (SCM). Due to the capabilities of real-time monitoring and evaluation of large-scale complex systems, significant research efforts have been made to exploit values of PI/DT in SCM. Despite this, the current literature remained largely unstructured and scattered due to a lack of systematic literature reviews to synergise research findings, analyse the evolution of research fronts and extract emerging trends in the field. To address this issue, the paper deploys a bibliometric knowledge mapping approach to provide a bird's eye view of the current research status in the PI/DT-SCM area. Using CiteSpace's keyword co-occurrence network, 518 journal articles are clustered into 10 key research streams on PI/DT applications in: job shop scheduling, smart manufacturing design, PI-based SCM, manufacturing virtualisation, information management, sustainability development, data analytics, manufacturing operations management, simulation and optimisation, and assembly process planning. Based on citation burst rate, keywords representing research frontiers of the PI/DT are detected and their temporal evolutions are discussed. Likewise, some identified emerging research trends are production process and system, robotics, computer architecture, and cost.

The main prerequisites for the emergence of the Industry 5.0 concept are studied, in particular, extensive digitization and the dynamic development of technologies of the fourth industrial revolution, which has led to the certain dehumanization of industry and has increased the interest of the scientific community in the aspects of industrial humanization, human-centeredness of industry, stability, sustainability, and resilience. The main principles and trends of the development of Industry 5.0, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, geopolitical crises, and disruptions of the global value chains on the condition and prospects for the development of world industry, new rules and requirements for global product manufacturers, technological innovations, and production trends are studied. The author identifies directions for expanding the concept of Industry 4.0 to include humanization, sustainability, and resilience. The rapid development of new technologies often outpaces the ability of organizations to align their development priorities with it and effectively take advantage of new opportunities, which leads to the need to navigate the changing business environment in time and develop a relevant development strategy. With so many technological changes, changing workforce demands, and social and regulatory priorities, there is a need to define guiding principles to help set the course for the digital industry. Industry 5.0 has become the basis for revising the future of energy, manufacturing, and mobility of supply chains, which rest on the foundations laid by Industry 4.0. The weaknesses of the Industry 4.0 concept, especially in terms of the role of a human in ""smart"" production and ensuring sustainable development are outlined. Accordingly, the expediency of further research and implementation of the Industry 5.0 concept is substantiated. On the basis of the conducted research on the implementation of Industry 5.0 and the world trends of industrial development, the author justifies the feasibility of reorienting production and business activities to human-centeredness as a new norm, strengthening sustainability, in particular, careful planning of stabilization measures in case of disruption of the global value chains – from factory facilities to network supplier, to transport channels, to regulatory and geopolitical changes, ensuring sustainability with manufacturers rethinking their impact on natural resources in connection with the expansion of the regulatory and legislative framework and investors' attention to reducing carbon emissions and negative impact on the environment.",,Socio-Economic Problems of the Modern Period of Ukraine,,,2022,2022,,2022,,3(155),41-46,Closed,Article,"Ryvak, Nataliya O.","Ryvak, Nataliya O.

Several studies discuss the impacts of disruptive technologies on smart logistics operations in Industry 4.0. However, since Industry 5.0 is a new concept and still in its infancy, its implications for smart logistics have not been discussed. Methods: To fill this gap, this paper presents a comparative bibliometric analysis to show the connection and differences between Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0 and their implications for smart logistics. A thorough content analysis is then given to illustrate the features of smart logistics in Industry 5.0 concerning four areas, namely intelligent automation, intelligent devices, intelligent systems, and intelligent materials. Results: The results show that, compared with Industry 4.0, the research of smart logistics in Industry 5.0 puts more focus on the interaction between humans and technology in the digital transition, with the increasing adoption of collaborative technologies, e.g., human-machine systems, collaborative robots, and human-robot collaboration.

Future factory floor workers will work in teams that include both human co-workers and smart machine actors. The visions of Industry 5.0 describe sustainable, resilient, and human-centered future factories that will require smart and resilient capabilities both from next-generation manufacturing systems and human operators. What kinds of approaches can help design these kinds of resilient human–machine teams and collaborations within them? In this paper, we analyze this design challenge, and we propose basing the design on the joint cognitive systems approach. The established joint cognitive systems approach can be complemented with approaches that support human centricity in the early phases of design, as well as in the development of continuously co-evolving human–machine teams. We propose approaches to observing and analyzing the collaboration in human–machine teams, developing the concept of operations with relevant stakeholders, and including ethical aspects in the design and development.

Individuals, companies, and supply chains face challenges emerging from economic, sociological, and political phenomena. These phenomena disrupt regular performance and limit the efficient functioning of companies and economies. Due to numerous relations and connections in the economy, disruptions in one area affect the others and spread, growing in range and severity. Hence, disruptions should be dealt with to provide continuity of supply chains and to ensure their efficient and effective performance. The study aims to identify crucial characteristics of disruptions to facilitate disruption minimization strategies. The characteristics of disruptions in supply chains are identified based on a literature review, synthesized and validated by the experts.

However, little has been done to understand how this ill-defined phenomenon may deliver its indented sustainability values despite these speculative promises. To address this knowledge gap, the present study developed a strategy roadmap that explains the mechanism by which Industry 5.0 delivers its intended sustainable development functions. The study first developed and introduced the Industry 5.0 reference model that describes the technical and functional properties of this phenomenon. The study further conducted a content-centric synthesis of the literature and identified the sustainable development functions of Industry 5.0. Next, the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique was employed to identify the sequential relationships among the functions and construct the Industry 5.0-enabled model of sustainable development. The ISM involved collecting the opinions of 11 Industry 5.0 experts through expert panel meetings. Results revealed that Industry 5.0 delivers sustainable development values through 16 functions. Circular intelligent products, employee technical assistance, intelligent automation, open sustainable innovation, renewable integration, and supply chain adaptability are examples of the functions identified. These functions are highly interrelated and should be developed in a specific order so that the synergies and complementarities among them would maximize the sustainable development value gains. The roadmap to Industry 5.0-driven sustainability developed in this study is expected to provide a better understanding of ways Industry 5.0 can contribute to sustainable development, explaining how the development of its functions should be managed to maximize their synergies and contribution to the intended sustainability values. The study also highlights important avenues for future research, emphasizing the potential enablers of Industry 5.0 development, such as Government 5.0 or Corporate Governance 5.0.",This research has been a part of a project that received funding from the European Union&#x27;s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 810318.,Sustainable Production and Consumption,,,2022-09,2022,,2022-09,33,,716-737,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Ghobakhloo, Morteza; Iranmanesh, Mohammad; Mubarak, Muhammad Faraz; Mubarik, Mobashar; Rejeb, Abderahman; Nilashi, Mehrbakhsh","Ghobakhloo, Morteza (School of Economics and Business, Kaunas University of Technology, Kaunas, Lithuania); Iranmanesh, Mohammad (School of Business and Law, Edith Cowan University, Joondalup, WA 6027, Australia); Mubarak, Muhammad Faraz (School of Economics and Business, Kaunas University of Technology, Kaunas, Lithuania); Mubarik, Mobashar (Faculty of Technology Management and Business, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Malaysia); Rejeb, Abderahman (Department of Management and Law, Faculty of Economics, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Via Columbia, 2, Rome 00133, Italy); Nilashi, Mehrbakhsh (UCSI Graduate Business School, UCSI University, No. 1 Jalan Menara Gading, UCSI Heights, 56000 Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Centre for Global Sustainability Studies (CGSS), Universiti Sains Malaysia, 11800, USM Penang, Malaysia)","Ghobakhloo, Morteza (Kaunas University of Technology)","Ghobakhloo, Morteza (Kaunas University of Technology); Iranmanesh, Mohammad (Edith Cowan University); Mubarak, Muhammad Faraz (Kaunas University of Technology); Mubarik, Mobashar (Tun Hussein Onn University of Malaysia); Rejeb, Abderahman (University of Rome Tor Vergata); Nilashi, Mehrbakhsh (UCSI University; Universiti Sains Malaysia)",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2022.08.003,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150022503,41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management; 44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,"12 Responsible Consumption and Production; 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Our results prove that selected components of the Industry 5.0 readiness model determine a positive marginal effect on the value added reported by countries. We also registered a significant influence on the development of the circular economy, in strong relation with the development of the knowledge economy.

The ambitious goal of zero defects requires the extensive utilization of emerging technologies. Amidst the major drive for technological advancement, humans are often kept out of the loop because they are perceived as the root cause of error. The report from the European Commission on Industry 5.0 emphasizes that human-centric is a key pillar in building a more resilient industry and is vital to incorporate the human component into the manufacturing sector. However, we did not find any publications that explain what human-centric ZDM is, nor what the roles of humans are in advancing ZDM. As a contribution to bridging this gap, a systematic literature review is conducted using different databases. We collected 36 publications and categorised them into 3 different human roles which are managers, engineers, and operators. From our search, we found out that managers play a vital role in cultivating ZDM in the entire organization to prevent errors despite the fact they often do not have direct contact with the production line as operators. Operators can help advance ZDM through knowledge capturing with feedback functions to the engineer to better design a corrective action to prevent errors. Assistive technologies such as extended reality are efficient tools used by operators to eliminate human errors in production environments. Human-centric is now a goal in the future manufacturing sector, but it could face barriers such as high technological investments and resistance to changes in their work tasks. This paper can contribute to paving the roadmap of human-centric ZDM to bring defects to zero and reposition the manufacturing sector to become more resilient.",The authors appreciate the support and valuable discussions with old and new colleagues at SINTEF and the NTNU – The Norwegian University of Science and Technology.,Computers in Industry,,,2023-01,2023,,2023-01,144,,103792,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Wan, Paul Kengfai; Leirmo, Torbjørn Langedahl","Wan, Paul Kengfai (SINTEF Manufacturing AS, Grøndalsvegen 2, 2830 Raufoss, Norway); Leirmo, Torbjørn Langedahl (SINTEF Manufacturing AS, Grøndalsvegen 2, 2830 Raufoss, Norway)","Wan, Paul Kengfai (SINTEF)","Wan, Paul Kengfai (SINTEF); Leirmo, Torbjørn Langedahl (SINTEF)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2022.103792,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151954909,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4601 Applied Computing; 4609 Information Systems,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

However, there is a lack of shared understanding of the essence of human-centric manufacturing, though significant research efforts exist in enhancing the physical and cognitive wellbeing of operators. Therefore, this position paper presents our arguments on the concept, needs, reference model, enabling technologies and system frameworks of human-centric manufacturing, providing a relatable vision and research agenda for future work in human-centric manufacturing systems. We believe human-centric manufacturing should ultimately address human needs defined in an Industrial Human Needs Pyramid – from basic needs of safety and health to the highest level of esteem and self-actualization. In parallel, human-machine relationships will change following a 5C evolution map – from current Coexistence, Cooperation and Collaboration to future Compassion and Coevolution. As such, human-centric manufacturing systems need to have bi-directional empathy, proactive communication and collaborative intelligence for establishing trustworthy human-machine coevolution relationships, thereby leading to high-performance human-machine teams.

In fact, Industry 5.0 focuses on research and innovation to support industrial production sustainability and place the well-being of industrial workers at the center of the production process. Thus, Industry 5.0 relies on three pillars: it is human-centric, it encourages sustainability and it is aimed at developing resilience against disruptions. Such core aspects cannot be fully achieved without a transparent end-to-end human-centered traceability throughout the value chain. As a consequence, Auto-Identification (Auto-ID) technologies play a key role, since they are able to provide automated item recognition, positioning and tracking without human intervention or in cooperation with industrial operators. Although the most popular Auto-ID technologies provide a certain degree of security and productivity, there are still open challenges for future Industry 5.0 factories. This article analyzes and evaluates the Auto-ID landscape and delivers a holistic perspective and understanding of the most popular and the latest technologies, looking for solutions that cope with harsh, diverse and complex industrial scenarios. In addition, it describes a methodology for selecting Auto-ID technologies for Industry 5.0 factories. Such a methodology is applied to a specific use case of the shipbuilding industry that requires identifying the main components of a ship during its construction and repair. To validate the outcomes of the methodology, a practical evaluation of passive and active UHF RFID tags was performed in an Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV) under construction, showing that a careful selection and evaluation of the tags enables product identification and tracking even in areas with a very high density of metallic objects. As a result, this article serves as a useful guide for industrial stakeholders, including future developers and managers that seek for deploying identification and traceability technologies in Industry 5.0 scenarios.","This work was supported in part by the Auto-Identification for Intelligent Products Research Line of the Navantia-Universidade da Coruña Joint Research Unit under Grant IN853B-2018/02, and in part by the Centro de Investigación de Galicia ‘‘CITIC,’’ funded by Xunta de Galicia and the European Union (European Regional Development Fund-Galicia 2014–2020 Program) under Grant ED431G 2019/01.

The use of RFID is particularly suited to IIoT as it does not require a line of sight for communication and can be retroactively affixed to non-smart items. However, RFID communication is affected by the properties of the material the tag is affixed to, specifically the material permittivity. Metal is commonly present in smart factory environments and supply chains and impedes RFID communication. A suitable tag design is required to accommodate these challenges and ensure resilience for Industry 5.0 applications. The research presented in this paper has assessed the communication performance of RFID antenna designs with and without metal present beneath the tag. The RFID tag designs that performed reliably in the simulation were manufactured, and their read range was tested on materials of varying relative permittivity and thickness to represent MP and NMP scenarios.

Industry 4.0 presents a solid ambition for transforming to a digital, data-driven and interconnected manufacturing industry centred around cyber-physical convergence. Although the relevance of Industry 4.0 technologies’ disruptions on operations management has been acknowledged, a significant gap in the evolution of the logic and design of MPC systems has been observed. The requirements of on-demand products and services with enhanced flexibility, resilience, sustainability and humanitarianism in this new industrial revolution call for innovations of MPC architectures and approaches. This paper first summarizes the evolution of MPC systems with enabling technologies and the changing business climate at that time. To explore innovative MPC that complies with the increasing economic, social and environmental requirements, the concept of synchronization-oriented MPC with four principles is proposed. Following the principles, a general framework for the synchronization-oriented MPC with enhanced economic, social and environmental benefits is developed. This work potentially provides insights into innovative MPC in the age of Industry 4.0 and even Industry 5.0.",,IFAC-PapersOnLine,,,2022,2022,,2022,55,2,163-168,All OA; Gold,Article,"Guo, Daqiang; Ling, Shiquan; Rong, Yiming; Huang, George Q.","Guo, Daqiang (Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering, The University of Hong Kong Hong Kong, China; Department of Mechanical and Energy Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology Shenzhen, China); Ling, Shiquan (Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering, The University of Hong Kong Hong Kong, China; Department of Mechanical and Energy Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology Shenzhen, China); Rong, Yiming (Department of Mechanical and Energy Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology Shenzhen, China); Huang, George Q.

In the manufacturing context, workers' diversity in terms of experience, productivity and physical capacity represents a significant challenge for companies, especially those characterized by high staff turnover and manual processes with high workload and poor ergonomics. In seeking to address such challenges, this research adopts a human-centric perspective to define new flexible job arrangements by developing a new multi-objective job rotation scheduling model. The proposed model is unique in that it aims to achieve multiple job assignment objectives by simultaneously considering different socio-technical factors: workers' experience, physical capacity and limitations, postural ergonomic risks, noise and vibration exposure, and workers' boredom. The model's implementation in real environments can be supported by new sensor-based technologies that collect data on workers' efficiency, ergonomic scores and task performance and enable workers to participate in measuring perceived fatigue and boredom.

Although the notion of DX has garnered much research interest from practitioners, scholarship on this topic is somehow lagging behind, possibly because of the lack of theoretical frameworks on DX. Recently, most Japanese firms have begun to use diverse digital technologies to sustain their competitive advantages. However, the return of investment on digital technologies has not been as high as expected for some firms. Furthermore, as the visions of Industry 5.0 describe sustainable, resilient, and human-centered future factories that will require smart and resilient capabilities both from next-generation manufacturing systems and human operators, it is necessary to design resilient human–machine collaborations within factories. To this end, this paper presents a research model between DX technologies and scientific problem-solving in terms of deduction, induction, and abduction inference structures as an approach to resilient human–machine collaborations. The purpose of this research is to analyze the difference in the utilization pattern of the digital technology of American, German, and Japanese firms based on three types of decision-making methods. Next, we apply this framework in a comparative case study of two Japanese firms and one German firm, where we find that there is a difference in DX technologies utilization among the Japanese and German firms. We assert that the utilization of IoT technology in the United States and Germany is pursuing IoT with the aim of autonomous control, whereas Japanese firms prioritize robot–human collaboration. Finally, we discuss how our findings contribute to the burgeoning field of resilient human–machine collaborations by showing the distinct roles of deduction, induction, and abduction inference structures.

A deep understanding of the work environment and organization is important to start analysing the working conditions and the resulting User eXperience (UX) of the operators. Also, the knowledge about users’ needs and ergonomics is fundamental to optimize the workers’ wellbeing, working conditions, and industrial results. In this context, the paper presents a strategy to effectively assess the UX of workers to promote human-centric vision of manufacturing sites, enhancing the overall sustainability of the modern factories. A set of non-invasive wearable devices is used to monitor human activities and collect physiological parameters, as well as questionnaires to gather subjective self-assessment.

The scope of the new Industrial Revolution will be to reinforce the Human and Machine Interface (HMI), based on foundations built during the Industry 4.0. Therefore, classic learning models will have to be adapted to this reality. Furthermore, the recent global pandemic has facilitated the development of solutions/platforms for the virtual collaboration for various aspects of everyday life, including professional meetings, educational lectures, academic collaborations, and personal relationships.

This study investigates the assembly line balancing problem (ALBP), considering HRC. This problem, abbreviated ALBP-HRC, arises in advanced manufacturing systems, where humans and collaborative robots share the same workplace and can simultaneously perform tasks in parallel or in collaboration. Driven by the need to solve the more complex assembly line-balancing problems found in the automotive industry, this study aims to address the ALBP-HRC with the cycle time and the number of operators (humans and robots) as the primary and secondary objective, respectively. In addition to the traditional ALBP constraints, the human and robot characteristics, in terms of task times, allowing multiple humans and robots at stations, and their joint/collaborative tasks are formulated into a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. A neighborhood-search simulated annealing (SA) is proposed with customized solution representation and neighborhood search operators designed to fit into the problem characteristics. Furthermore, the proposed SA features an adaptive neighborhood selection mechanism that enables the SA to utilize its exploration history to dynamically choose appropriate neighborhood operators as the search evolves. The proposed MILP and SA are implemented on real cases taken from the automotive industry where stations are designed for HRC. The computational results over different problems show that the adaptive SA produces promising solutions compared to the MILP and other swarm intelligence algorithms, namely genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and artificial bee colony.

561,pub.1142629008,10.1515/9783110693225,,,"Soft Computing in Smart Manufacturing, Solutions toward Industry 5.0","This chapter highlights the convergence of soft computing techniques with contemporary manufacturing and machining processes. The chapter has been divided into two subsegments, with the first one comprehensively discussing the machining processes and the integration of automation techniques in these processes. The importance and utility of computerized numerical control and part programming are interlinked with automation hardware and robotics. The extension of machining in Integrated Manufacturing Systems (IMS) with coordinated functioning of robotics and numerical control is also emphasized. The correlation of precision and Computer Integrated (Flexible) Manufacturing (CIM) cites key advantages of automation and computerized control over the conventional non-mechanized machining techniques or manual material removal operations. In the second subsegment, soft computing as a systems engineering approach has been discussed interlinking its aptness for the machining operations. The current soft computing methods including fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks (ANN), and genetic algorithms (GA) for the predictive modeling of machining operations has been elaborated in this chapter citing their utilization and significance in controlling, monitoring, and modeling these tasks. A comparison of soft computing approach for machining has also been associated with the finite element modeling (FEM) methods to outweigh the benefits of automated control and modeling in each operation, and their suitability for the specific machining tasks. The generic discussion is presented to the readers for selecting the suitable automation and modeling approach to augment certain machining tasks in the segment on computational optimization of themachining processes. The key soft computing modules are highlighted in a concluding synopsis as a mechanism for driving future process modernizations from the perspective of Industry 5.0 leveraging customer-centric digitization, advanced modeling technologies, cognitive computing, big-data management, robots, and smart machines tethered together for eco-friendly machining. The interconnected nature of the Industry 4.0-driven operations, combined with the rapid pace of digital transformation, poses a unique challenge in terms of cybersecurity, impacting businesses and their continuity and, thus, in citizens’ daily lives. The SecureIoT project introduced an open standards-based framework for IoT (Internet of Things) security, which enables IoT solution developers, integrators, and deployers to integrate and deploy secure IoT services that span multiple IoT platforms and involve networks of smart objects with embedded intelligence and semi-autonomous behavior. In addition to the implementation of the technical requirements, however, these primarily serve to provide work assistance to the people deployed in production, starting with safe and optimized processes of operators and machine setters, involving different levels within the production chain. Here, SecureIoT supports humans in adhering to the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of intime, in-quality, and in-cost maxims amidst the diversity of industrial complexity. This is exemplified by automated Machine-2-Machine (M2M) show-offs being controlled at new levels of trustworthiness, which are usually only applied to human-2-human communication. With this type of control, humans can provide a higher level of trust to the agile resource-driven automated decision-making processes for manufacturing and product security decisions. This way, SecureIoT contributes to the principles of human-centric industry and toward a secure and resilient society. Intelligent mobile robots are foreseen as one of the possible solutions to efficiently performing transportation and manipulation tasks in intelligent manufacturing systems (IMS) of Industry 4.0. In the last few decades, deep learning models have been recognized as a promising technique to enable the intelligent behavior of mobile robots for performing such tasks. For the particular problems of object detection and classification, a class of deep learning models, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), is the most widely used. This chapter presents an application of Region-based CNN (R-CNN) for advanced object identification tasks by using transfer learning. The proposed learning approach is further used for the improvement of Image- Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) algorithm used to control an intelligent mobile robot. The proposed algorithms are implemented in the MATLAB software package, and both simulation and the experimental verification of the proposed concept are performed on intelligent mobile robot, DOMINO (Deep learning Omnidirectional Mobile robot with INtelligent cOntrol). Four different CNN models are trained for object detection and classification, and the most suitable CNN model is ResNet-18, with the best recorded mean Average Precision (mAP) of 77%. Achieved experimental results show the applicability of CNN for accurate detection and classification of different manufacturing entities and the IBVS algorithm for efficient mobile robot control within IMS. The digital twin is a digital replica of physical data, processes, systems, and a digital simulation of reality, which can be used for various purposes. The concept of the digital twin provides an efficient way to cyber-physically integrate production, and optimize business processes and operational production procedures, thus achieving a new higher level of productivity. Digital twins can use data from sensors installed on physical objects to represent their status in real time, operating condition, or position. Two examples of digital twin development are presented, the first is based on static setting of a model and the second is based on dynamic setting. One of the essential criteria for smart factories, specifically for open computer numerical control (CNC) machine tool, is to bridge the gap between the physical machine tool and upper-level software applications. The difficulties are due to lack of an efficient and sufficient monitoring system. The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) and information technology overcame those issues and enabled the implementation of the industry 4.0 concept. This chapter presents a methodology and a case study on a novel implementation of an open CNC PC (personal computer)-based and service-oriented architecture-based monitoring system for Standard for Exchange of Product compliant Numerical Control (STEP-NC). The service-oriented architecture was implemented to efficiently use and manage information. The architecture is composed of four main layers: perception, communication, application, and CNC machine layer. In the perception layer, the CNC machine tool’s information is sensed via wearable devices, including two temperature sensors (infrared and thermocouple), one vibration sensor, and one electric current sensor. Then, the information is output to Node-MCU (ESP 8266) as a wireless Wi-Fi module. Under the communication layer, message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) network protocol is used to enable data transfer from device to device. The information from Node- MCU is sent wirelessly to the MQTT server through a device called Raspberry-Pi. After that, the information from the MQTT server is sent to the Application layer, which includes Node-RED and ThingSpeak. Finally, the information from the application layer is sent to the CNC machine to enable feedback in real-time, based on the machining process condition information. The completed system is then tested through two cased studies for system feasibility. The first case study is based on STEP-NC EXAMPLE 1 of Part 21 consisting features of one hole and one pocket, while case study two is based on modified STEP-NC EXAMPLE 1 of Part 21 consisting features of four holes and two pockets. Through the case study, the developed system successfully enabled data flow from CNC machine tool to upperlevel software and back to the CNC machine through an open CNC PC-based and service-oriented architecture-based monitoring system for STEP-NC. In the future, this novel development could be applied to other open CNC machine-based plug and play. Industry 4.0 has increased the potential for intelligent, broad-based, fully adaptable, autonomous, and fully accessible vision system research and industrial inspections based on the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, with technical advancements and successes. One of the key objectives of using the 3SMVI system is to significantly improve the quality of the product in the smart industries. This system precisely bridges the gap between machine vision and object dimension measurements. This chapter proposes the development of subsystems of an automated smart system based on STEP-NC for machine vision inspection - 3SMVI to detect and measure the surface feature of EXAMPLE 1 Part 21 of the ISO14649 standards. The objective of this chapter is to examine the concept of 3SMVI in the milling machine based on the camera system and lighting system to ensure the quality of the product. It discusses the complete procedure for designing a 3SMVI system to inspect the dimensions of the case study of the Delrin workpiece in real time. The pending step is to accept the requirements and conditions for the inspection. Thus, some of these criteria relate to inspecting the case study and others imposed on the industry. The appropriate selection of each essential aspect of the 3SMVI system has been presented. The Open CV library- developed system platform becomes a kind of cloud communication between the Raspberry Pi 4 board and the USB microprocessor on the principle of camera range. The cameras, lenses, lighting system, and processing platform are the significant characteristics. Finally, this chapter describes the hardware part of the 3SMVI system. More precisely, the imaging systems design and installation configuration were very compact and complete in terms of integration into a single-camera setup mounted at the top of the spindle. The empirical results shown in this chapter demonstrate that the proposed innovative calibrating technique can produce a very accurate model of the structured light sensor system. Global development requires the use of contemporary soft computing in production processes. The introduction of intelligent production processes requires the consideration of more advanced aspects in modern production technologies. In response to market demands, it is necessary to introduce advanced cutting processes that are consistent with the concept of sustainable development, and supported by modern data processing and control technologies. In this chapter, the concept of smart machining in advanced cutting processes and their soft computing-based modeling are described. A machinability evaluation framework of based on the analysis and parameterization of the advanced machining process by the selection of influencing factors and process performance indicators is shown. This activity is referred to as the necessary phase that creates the background for soft computing. The fundamentals of various soft computing techniques used in data analysis, modeling, simulation, and optimization of advanced cutting processes are presented. Minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) and High-pressure jet assisted machining (HPJAM) were analyzed as advanced machining processes. Process analysis was performed using the bio-inspired algorithm soft computing, and conclusions were drawn about the machinability, efficiency, and economy of the machining process. Natural-fiber-reinforced polymer composites are utilized in various fields, such as military, construction, packing, and sports due to their remarkable characteristics. Machining of reinforced polymer composites by using conventional machining process is too difficult and not economical and, therefore, unconventional machining plays a vital role. This chapter presents the modeling and optimization of the Abrasive water jet machining (AWJM) process on the processing of bananafiber- reinforced polymer composites (BFRPC) by using the Taguchi - JAYA method. Firstly, BFRP composites are fabricated with 5% weight by using the hand layup process. Secondly, the experimental analysis is done based on Taguchi method (L27 orthogonal array) and JAYA optimization technique to analyze the impact of processing variables, such as working pressure (WP), stand of distance (SoD), and nozzle speed (NS) on two response variables: material removal rate (MRR) and surface roughness (SR). Thirdly, parametric analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and regression analysis are carried out for fitness and statistical implications of the AWJM process using BFRP composites. The investigation results showed that the AWJM process is the most efficient technique for machining BFRC composites. JAYA algorithm is applied to determine the optimal conditions of the AWJM process. Desirability function approach (DFA) is applied to determine the overall desirability value, considering both responses (MRR and SR) that could help to evaluate the optimal conditions. JAYA algorithm determined an exceptionally high desirability value, equal to 0.9952 (close to one), for the population size and maximum number of iterations set at 60 and 40, respectively. JAYA algorithm determined optimized conditions that resulted in the following percent deviations in prediction with respect to practical experimental results: 3.2% for MRR and 7.8% for SR.",,,,,2021-11-15,2021,2021-11-15,2021-11-22,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142629008,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"
