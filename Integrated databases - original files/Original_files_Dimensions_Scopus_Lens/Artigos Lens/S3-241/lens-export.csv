While I4.0 aims to provision cognitive CPS systems, the nascent Industry 5.0 (I5.0) era goes a step beyond, aiming to build cross-border, sustainable, and circular value chains benefiting society as a whole. An enabler of this vision is the integration of data and AI in the industrial decision-making process, which does not exhibit yet a coordination between the Operation and Information Technology domains (OT/IT). This work proposes an architectural approach and an accompanying software prototype addressing the OT/IT convergence problem. The approach is based on a two-layered middleware solution, where each layer aims to better serve the specific differentiated requirements of the OT and IT layers. The proposal is validated in a real testbed, employing actual machine data, showing the capacity of the components to gracefully scale and serve increasing data volumes.",22,1,190,,Enabling; Testbed; Middleware (distributed applications); Computer science; Process (computing); Cyber-physical system; Industry 4.0; Convergence (economics); Software; Information and Communications Technology; System integration; Software engineering,Industry 5.0; OT/IT integration; cloud continuum; cyber–physical systems; machine-to-machine; smart manufacturing,Industry; Information Technology; Software,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22010190,35009732,10.3390/s22010190,,PMC8749629,0,013-024-374-365-732; 023-178-507-463-18X; 046-168-936-322-452; 050-997-950-548-215; 051-794-592-567-825; 054-337-564-111-551; 060-317-465-188-456; 098-064-383-401-264; 101-811-273-263-30X; 123-003-416-766-610; 123-760-662-586-373,6,true,cc-by,gold

It started dating back in the late 1700s and has been in continuous evolution since then. Presently, we are experiencing the latest industrial revolution, known as Industry 4.0. Among others, ubiquitous technologies probably have been the most influential in the implementation of Industry 4.0. This has led to a new manufacturing paradigm known as ubiquitous manufacturing. This chapter presents an in-depth discussion on different aspects of ubiquitous manufacturing. In addition to the history of industrial revolutions and the fundamentals of ubiquitous manufacturing, the topics such as production planning and scheduling, automated material handling system, and dynamic manufacturing are meticulously discussed from the perspective of the real-life scenarios, in the age of ubiquitous manufacturing.

In the era of the industrial revolution 4.0 and society 5.0, the paradigm of developing issues is related to global issues, one of which is the issue of the earth issue, in which there is a study on the importance of humans to protect and maintain ecosystem balance. The introduction of green behavior through ecoliteracy is very important for children through the role of adults. Children must have an awareness of loving the environment so that when the child has the awareness to love the environment, the child will happily show behavior to protect the universe. Study Methods This is a literature review of various sources related to ecoliteracy that are relevant to embedding green behavior in early childhood. There are several interesting ways to introduce green behavior through ecoliteracy in early childhood which are obtained from the results of the study of relevant studies, among others, by using storytelling methods, conducting field trips or field trips, and carrying out project activities to preserve the surrounding environment.",11,11,1551,1558,Sociology; TRIPS architecture; Storytelling; Early childhood; Study methods; Environmental ethics,,,,,https://www.sysrevpharm.org/articles/develop-green-behaviour-through-ecoliteracy-for-early-children.pdf https://www.sysrevpharm.org/abstract/develop-green-behaviour-through-ecoliteracy-for-early-children-66802.html,https://www.sysrevpharm.org/abstract/develop-green-behaviour-through-ecoliteracy-for-early-children-66802.html,,,3114357354,,0,,0,false,,

Under this paper I have highlighted the pros and cons in favour and those oppose to the practice. The practitioners argued for its continuation because it was an important cultural heritage that marks the transition of a girl from childhood to adulthood while the abolitionists wanted it to be abolished because it violates human rights. I have adopted a doctrinal method of research under this paper to look into the veracity of the arguments of both sides. The prevailing opinion is that FGM or female circumcision violated both constitutionally guaranteed rights like rights to life, health, physical integrity, dignity, etc and human rights treaties and Conventions like United Nations Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Covenant on Civil and Political rights, the Maputo Protocol, etc. in view of this the practice should be abolished.      Keywords: Female, Genital, Mutilation, Circumcision, Cutting, Women’s Right.

Welfare; Matthew R. Hallowell; Julie A. Shah; Laurel D. Riek,"Worldwide, manufacturers are reimagining the future of their workforce and its connection to technology. Rather than replacing humans, Industry 5.0 explores how humans and robots can best complement one another's unique strengths. However, realizing this vision requires an in-depth understanding of how workers view the positive and negative attributes of their jobs, and the place of robots within it. In this paper, we explore the relationship between work attributes and automation goals by engaging in field research at a manufacturing plant. We conducted 50 face-to-face interviews with assembly-line workers $(\mathrm{n}=50)$ , which we analyzed using discourse analysis and social constructivist methods. We found that the work attributes deemed most positive by participants include social interaction, movement and exercise, (human) autonomy, problem solving, task variety, and building with their hands. The main negative work attributes included health and safety issues, feeling rushed, and repetitive work. We identified several ways robots could help reduce negative work attributes and enhance positive ones, such as reducing work interruptions and cultivating physical and psychological well-being. Based on our findings, we created a set of integration considerations for organizations planning to deploy robotics technology, and discuss how the manufacturing and HRI communities can explore these ideas in the future.",,,75,84,Field research; Variety (cybernetics); Psychology; Task analysis; Work (electrical); Workforce; Work experience; Knowledge management; Autonomy; Discourse analysis,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/hri/hri2019.html#WelfareHSR19 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8673139/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/hri.2019.8673139,,10.1109/hri.2019.8673139,2929884532,,0,001-121-290-926-132; 002-584-751-652-291; 003-793-700-759-176; 004-354-297-930-966; 004-771-471-010-549; 012-370-295-968-16X; 012-710-005-889-438; 013-420-504-189-875; 014-398-665-908-576; 016-782-552-400-986; 017-089-665-436-038; 018-601-301-453-597; 022-425-262-957-817; 024-649-196-865-724; 029-101-543-228-171; 032-254-293-408-115; 036-704-073-047-822; 041-526-359-881-654; 042-211-564-277-43X; 042-534-131-021-574; 042-588-618-550-033; 046-013-428-757-779; 046-875-312-520-293; 048-522-436-982-27X; 055-472-948-144-561; 056-728-662-820-803; 059-474-784-814-112; 065-623-633-767-666; 067-038-345-648-879; 068-013-611-636-252; 070-801-412-682-60X; 071-095-229-290-158; 073-128-134-887-817; 079-223-098-124-911; 084-969-912-500-793; 086-419-127-879-925; 088-721-426-301-445; 090-334-590-886-301; 091-725-872-061-572; 091-954-013-787-526; 095-811-393-275-086; 098-346-104-521-26X; 098-620-854-119-009; 101-113-684-704-95X; 103-597-914-038-179; 104-096-765-444-763; 111-141-823-258-031; 115-210-856-810-410; 120-441-241-892-092; 124-114-062-999-318; 134-932-989-205-250; 137-441-705-929-277; 138-223-939-384-207; 140-006-634-478-430; 142-048-600-326-867; 150-246-476-000-161; 161-172-850-367-669; 168-959-595-262-053; 171-596-748-965-859; 178-184-306-028-968; 178-912-373-262-853; 179-120-475-949-307; 193-364-789-473-151; 198-305-974-153-055,26,true,cc-by-nc-sa,green

The opportunities can contribute to the sustainable performance of the supply chains and their territories. The Industry 4.0 can also generate challenges like the social inequalities related to the position of the man in the labor market by replacing the human workforce with the machines. Therefore, the man-machine relationship in the Industry 4.0 era is analyzed as a gap in the literature. Therefore, as a way to fill this gap, the authors of this article suggest the exploration of the research focused on the Society 5.0. Also known as “super-smart society,” this recent theme appeared in Japan in April 2016. According to Fukuda (2020), in addition to the focus on the technological development, the Society 5.0 also aims at the quality of life and the social challenge resolutions.,This article contributes to the analysis of the Industry 4.0 technologies as facilitators in the sustainable supply chain performance. It addresses the impacts of the Industry 4.0 technologies applied to the supply chains in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it analyzes the research gaps and limitations found in the literature. The result of this study can add value and stimulate new research studies related to the application of the Industry 4.0 technologies as facilitators in the supply chain sustainable performance. It can encourage the studies related to the COVID-19 impacts on the sustainable supply chains, and it can promote the research development on the relationship among the man, the machine and the labor in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.",70,5,988,1016,Supply chain;

Miraz; Chul-Soo Kim,"Application of Information Technology (IT) in the domain of Human Resource Management (HRM) systems is a sine qua non for any organization for successfully adopting and implementing Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). However, these systems are required to ensure non-biased, efficient, transparent and secure environment. Blockchain, a technology based on distributed digital ledgers, can help facilitate the process of successfully effectuating these specifications. A detailed literature review has been conducted to identify the current status of usage of Information Technology in the domain of Human Resource Management and how Blockchain can help achieve a smart, cost-effective, efficient, transparent and secure factory management system. A Blockchain based Recruitment Management System (BcRMS) as well as Blockchain based Human Resource Management System (BcHRMS) algorithm have been proposed. From the analysis of the results obtained through the case study, it is evident that the proposed system holds definite advantages compared to the existing recruitment systems. Future research directions have also been identified and advocated.",,,1,6,Engineering management; Information technology; Human resource management system; Management system; Human resource management; Industry 4.0; Blockchain; Factory (object-oriented programming); Computer science; Process (engineering); Industrial Revolution,,,,,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv181203237M/abstract https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03237 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.03237 http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03237,http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/cp.2018.1371,,10.1049/cp.2018.1371,2903815641; 3102756733,,1,007-553-069-846-19X; 019-678-031-064-832; 027-177-624-795-31X; 030-236-109-234-935; 040-723-261-173-592; 054-614-088-841-213; 081-365-052-727-317; 086-219-547-937-793; 088-632-570-317-877; 089-363-390-670-335; 111-448-482-795-037; 117-219-057-745-062; 132-314-003-307-090; 136-965-945-109-201; 177-107-873-531-089; 186-307-980-097-241,42,true,,green
006-449-016-985-018,A Scientometric Analysis of Studies on Risk Management in Construction Projects,2022-08-31,2022,journal article,Buildings,20755309,MDPI AG,,Robert Osei-Kyei; Timur Narbaev; Godslove Ampratwum,"<jats:p>Risk management is one of the topical areas in construction project management research. However, no attempt has been made in the past decades to explore the emerging themes in this area. This paper reviews the research trends in risk management in construction. The bibliometric data of 1635 publications between 1979 and 2022 were extracted from Scopus using a set of keywords. The study used VOSviewer and Gephi to conduct a scientometric analysis on the extracted publications. The review outcome indicates a significant increase in publications on risk management in construction, with about 205 publications recorded between 2021 and 2022 alone. Based on this analysis, it is projected that the next decade will see significant research on risk management, especially as the construction industry moves towards Industry 5.0 with many uncertainties. Further, the most productive countries of risk management studies in construction include China, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Hong Kong. Emerging key research areas are discussed using network diagrams and clusters. These areas include the processes in risk management, risk analytical models and techniques, sources of risk and uncertainties, effective knowledge-based systems for improved risk management, risk contingency in construction contracts, risk-integrated project planning and scheduling, and stakeholder management. The findings of this study inform researchers on the current progress of risk management studies in construction and highlight possible research directions that can be considered.</jats:p>",12,9,1342,1342,Risk management; Stakeholder; Project risk management; IT risk management; Business; Risk analysis (engineering); Risk management framework; Scopus; Risk assessment; Risk management plan; Engineering,,,,Science Committee of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings12091342,,10.3390/buildings12091342,,,0,001-894-368-767-122; 003-912-384-463-283; 004-348-751-680-442; 005-925-984-223-051; 008-346-389-577-405; 010-171-819-922-943; 013-123-944-981-275; 018-067-060-066-520; 022-185-892-291-255; 022-409-042-563-509; 025-889-332-248-667; 027-571-651-572-301; 027-981-553-410-415; 030-772-480-390-843; 035-292-136-057-557; 042-061-286-379-055; 046-727-219-981-488; 047-134-478-431-993; 047-564-268-551-866; 048-274-932-822-419; 048-536-146-197-924; 050-068-788-406-609; 057-062-781-863-898; 057-407-520-193-786; 063-907-427-205-680; 064-622-226-235-864; 067-164-171-987-113; 067-697-467-605-585; 068-963-905-554-251; 069-572-718-065-071; 075-362-012-742-087; 084-521-600-908-380; 086-865-887-177-192; 089-271-182-897-916; 090-809-401-873-322; 093-999-172-956-296; 094-145-717-742-27X; 096-877-648-034-697; 098-015-124-763-403; 103-117-579-810-903; 107-518-655-388-824; 113-892-296-467-80X; 116-382-252-458-396; 117-958-925-859-887; 122-499-073-680-182; 144-883-798-820-546; 162-061-485-260-234; 162-123-368-418-70X; 165-969-546-748-436; 193-408-680-898-115; 195-989-268-216-224; 197-970-059-894-726,0,true,cc-by,gold

N. Firdauzi; A. Arumsari,"Nowadays, with the increasing world population, the production and consumption of disposable products is very high. Thus, causing waste that fills the land and sea. Not only waste from humans, but the Indonesian sea also produces marine biota waste that is usually stranded on the coasts. Waste of marine life on Santolo Beach, Garut, produces a negative impact on public health and causes environmental disturbance if left around the beach as only a part of it is decomposed in the soil and the rest remains as waste. The purpose of this paper is to design jewelry that also has a traceable supply chain, and can also contribute to the welfare of the environment and local community of Sagaranten, Sukabumi. This can be interpreted as halal jewellery. The author interprets and reinterprets the ethical halal to be applied to jewelry to be Halal in the context of Sustainable Product Design (SPD). This SPD will demonstrate the meaning of halal jewelry by processing, environmentally friendly materials as well as various other considerations in the social and economic fields to achieve sustainable profit-making products.",,,17,21,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9781003263135-3,,10.1201/9781003263135-3,,,0,,0,false,,

In this chapter, the applications of supercritical fluid technology and algal biomass technology are highlighted. Supercritical fluid technology is a carbon-neutral technology that is highly unique and versatile which supports the notions of biomanufacturing in the bioeconomy concept. Besides replacing conventional extraction methods, supercritical fluids can be applied towards enzymatic pretreatment and activation, biological membrane synthesis and bioalcohol recovery due to its non-reactive, non-flammable and clean separation properties. On the other hand, the potential of algal biomass technology in bioenergy production such as bio-lipids and biohydrogen can be exploited due to the intrinsic properties of microalgae that acts as a backbone in the bioremediation of gaseous greenhouse gases. Furthermore, microalgae technology can be integrated into existing traditional refineries to act similar to a separator that captures unwanted emissions and converts them into value-added products.",,,257,286,Biohydrogen; Supercritical fluid; Bioenergy; Biochemical engineering; Oil refinery; Biomanufacturing; Biomass; Extraction methods; Environmental science; Greenhouse gas,,,,,https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781003080671-12-12/state-art-technologies-industry-5-0-yee-ho-chai-guo-yong-yew-suzana-yusup-pau-loke-show,http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9781003080671-12-12,,10.1201/9781003080671-12-12,3160869637,,0,087-682-287-335-34X,0,false,,

This paper aims to contribute, in a preliminary way, to understand several of the implications in Sociology that this propagation of digital culture involves through a bibliographical review. We analyse several implications in dimensions such as the very purpose of Sociology (highlighting digital literacy and the level of democracy) and social research (addressing issues raised by the big date, the interdisciplinary dialogue between Sociology and other scientific areas, and new ethical dilemmas). We conclude that there are profound implications both in the research object and in the research processes of Sociology, which we will develop in later phases of the dissemination of this research. As a major implication, the reflective capacity of sociological knowledge is central to the preparation for this new reality, but, at the same time, also to a well-founded critical understanding of digital society.",7,3,101,106,Sociology; Digital literacy; Research Object; Digital culture; Digital society; Social research; Democracy; Engineering ethics,,,,,https://redfame.com/journal/index.php/ijsss/article/download/4221/4397 https://redfame.com/journal/index.php/ijsss/article/view/4221/4397 https://ideas.repec.org/a/rfa/journl/v7y2019i3p101-106.html https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/228083965.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.11114/ijsss.v7i3.4221,,10.11114/ijsss.v7i3.4221,2941032956,,0,022-146-159-357-985; 057-465-955-232-831; 065-454-781-114-304,3,true,cc-by,gold

Future factory floor workers will work in teams that include both human co-workers and smart machine actors. The visions of Industry 5.0 describe sustainable, resilient, and human-centered future factories that will require smart and resilient capabilities both from next-generation manufacturing systems and human operators. What kinds of approaches can help design these kinds of resilient human–machine teams and collaborations within them? In this paper, we analyze this design challenge, and we propose basing the design on the joint cognitive systems approach. The established joint cognitive systems approach can be complemented with approaches that support human centricity in the early phases of design, as well as in the development of continuously co-evolving human–machine teams. We propose approaches to observing and analyzing the collaboration in human–machine teams, developing the concept of operations with relevant stakeholders, and including ethical aspects in the design and development. We base our work on the joint cognitive systems approach and propose complementary approaches and methods, namely: actor–network theory, the concept of operations and ethically aware design. We identify their possibilities and challenges in designing and developing smooth human–machine teams for Industry 5.0 manufacturing systems.</jats:p>",14,5,2773,2773,Factory (object-oriented programming); Vision; Teamwork; Human–machine system; Computer science; Knowledge management; Industry 4.0; Joint (building); Human intelligence; Engineering; Process management; Engineering management; Artificial intelligence; Systems engineering,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14052773,,10.3390/su14052773,,,0,004-244-741-588-494; 005-744-982-702-558; 008-461-355-056-410; 011-706-935-997-445; 012-069-194-614-925; 017-459-070-179-170; 021-378-205-052-792; 022-023-237-030-946; 024-789-607-081-823; 024-895-641-633-117; 029-170-236-791-182; 036-542-045-061-441; 038-958-306-682-775; 039-234-402-137-091; 040-523-322-834-731; 045-830-443-220-746; 061-508-236-488-840; 061-974-448-733-340; 067-406-388-589-502; 081-034-990-695-773; 085-026-809-878-651; 117-812-700-190-439,6,true,cc-by,gold

010-590-914-224-912,Knowledge mapping of digital twin and physical internet in Supply Chain Management: A systematic literature review,,2022,journal article,International Journal of Production Economics,09255273; 18737579,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Tiep Nguyen; Quang Huy Duong; Truong Van Nguyen; You Zhu; Li Zhou,"Physical Internet (PI) is an open global logistics system of which components are hyperconnected for increased efficiency and sustainability. Digital twin (DT), referring to the virtual representation of a physical object, is well-perceived as a key driver in the development of PI-based Supply Chain Management (SCM). Due to the capabilities of real-time monitoring and evaluation of large-scale complex systems, significant research efforts have been made to exploit values of PI/DT in SCM. Despite this, the current literature remained largely unstructured and scattered due to a lack of systematic literature reviews to synergise research findings, analyse the evolution of research fronts and extract emerging trends in the field. To address this issue, the paper deploys a bibliometric knowledge mapping approach to provide a bird's eye view of the current research status in the PI/DT-SCM area. Using CiteSpace's keyword co-occurrence network, 518 journal articles are clustered into 10 key research streams on PI/DT applications in: job shop scheduling, smart manufacturing design, PI-based SCM, manufacturing virtualisation, information management, sustainability development, data analytics, manufacturing operations management, simulation and optimisation, and assembly process planning. Based on citation burst rate, keywords representing research frontiers of the PI/DT are detected and their temporal evolutions are discussed. Likewise, some identified emerging research trends are production process and system, robotics, computer architecture, and cost. Finally, seven future research directions are suggested, which emphasise on several PI/DT-related issues, including business ecosystem, sustainability development, SC downstream management, cognitive thinking in Industry 5.0, citizen twin in digital society, and SC resilience.",244,,108381,108381,Computer science; Fast fashion; Supply chain; Supply chain management; Process management; Analytics; The Internet; Sustainability; Knowledge management,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2021.108381,,10.1016/j.ijpe.2021.108381,,,0,000-375-548-189-568; 000-506-047-448-290; 000-634-489-297-828; 000-845-695-649-089; 001-479-581-905-784; 002-010-888-972-998; 002-215-790-525-136; 002-294-965-717-198; 003-951-406-265-053; 003-977-026-519-715; 005-221-388-388-364; 005-753-470-592-548; 006-388-016-871-145; 007-504-639-540-870; 007-857-490-001-29X; 007-943-326-313-110; 010-819-733-994-910; 011-018-575-862-58X; 011-064-867-391-975; 011-582-143-752-894; 012-700-032-298-335; 012-895-925-520-178; 012-923-514-429-842; 013-364-181-718-010; 014-269-884-650-180; 016-520-721-955-30X; 016-948-561-963-366; 020-096-656-286-019; 020-768-340-548-376; 021-166-031-376-003; 021-238-857-455-189; 021-386-049-291-029; 021-466-152-569-455; 021-768-506-002-91X; 022-811-319-743-955; 023-188-069-697-232; 023-699-532-367-134; 024-175-259-011-477; 024-564-990-473-792; 024-865-233-325-628; 025-146-310-226-558; 025-447-442-933-78X; 027-070-390-196-583; 027-335-161-889-58X; 027-419-187-690-825; 028-057-191-000-015; 028-172-891-776-803; 029-420-167-353-195; 029-660-351-012-836; 030-394-205-280-61X; 030-471-937-653-772; 030-686-554-327-070; 030-990-112-572-470; 032-265-800-999-962; 033-363-855-299-66X; 033-791-559-480-545; 034-797-930-862-008; 035-361-066-532-928; 035-612-321-981-450; 037-418-400-769-929; 037-638-296-138-514; 037-904-607-187-639; 037-945-118-531-575; 038-632-463-594-04X; 038-897-364-611-338; 044-472-737-404-82X; 045-116-019-239-52X; 046-420-103-164-690; 046-498-222-962-572; 047-291-734-468-955; 047-352-286-744-675; 047-947-690-992-868; 050-460-748-820-414; 053-390-569-461-215; 054-566-657-836-198; 054-872-615-622-461; 055-348-429-167-616; 056-178-641-627-082; 057-237-433-922-38X; 057-759-833-981-678; 057-789-040-348-458; 058-029-140-081-708; 058-184-877-686-509; 058-347-985-375-242; 059-946-465-120-677; 060-147-376-847-596; 061-962-132-890-210; 064-245-906-706-964; 064-400-499-357-900; 064-690-263-092-908; 065-085-518-912-738; 065-206-145-259-569; 066-174-869-656-116; 066-771-446-570-957; 067-164-171-987-113; 067-253-505-565-549; 067-703-009-019-085; 069-184-778-569-007; 071-361-455-780-656; 072-610-779-757-007; 074-687-132-320-961; 076-340-862-785-218; 077-571-063-166-597; 079-109-874-245-670; 080-436-406-243-416; 082-530-114-084-445; 082-707-661-201-023; 084-850-709-972-260; 085-912-259-715-810; 088-312-209-611-554; 090-731-522-534-055; 091-203-425-735-952; 093-080-120-142-422; 093-685-209-110-090; 095-096-161-740-778; 095-256-672-289-333; 095-366-405-250-466; 096-355-286-600-445; 098-762-208-761-893; 099-866-638-042-779; 100-742-208-652-701; 101-943-376-682-990; 104-495-326-573-684; 105-329-947-846-748; 105-941-642-967-558; 108-005-596-606-248; 108-567-859-928-412; 109-360-319-818-608; 110-745-539-662-230; 117-032-248-723-624; 117-047-936-699-244; 117-483-387-688-980; 118-344-159-936-803; 119-312-052-762-583; 119-717-088-654-176; 119-781-040-661-744; 123-075-792-876-314; 124-187-743-925-055; 125-546-286-836-572; 130-067-918-478-981; 131-206-117-846-231; 135-829-002-164-149; 138-684-993-786-479; 140-266-834-889-884; 141-770-447-621-043; 142-258-117-619-913; 142-423-808-319-246; 142-610-776-896-885; 143-310-125-382-890; 144-237-316-313-335; 145-037-125-082-79X; 148-802-154-845-367; 150-642-090-497-296; 152-664-153-882-037; 160-081-115-291-67X; 160-165-859-531-734; 166-418-707-830-779; 169-607-927-978-507,7,true,,green

The SSWM-related causal interrelationships within the proposed hierarchical structure, and critical barriers for the practical improvement and enhancement of SSWM performance are identified as preference enriching both literature and practices. In nature, the hierarchical structure is with the causal interrelationships under uncertainties. The perspective empowers the creation of a new biosphere based on technological progress, but in the sustainable solid waste management field, it is difficult to encounter and shape the systematized processes due to barriers and challenges. To address this shortcoming, this study evaluates the technical challenges faced in the field of sustainable solid waste management toward society 5.0. The valid attributes are usually described the qualitative information. The fuzzy Delphi method is applied to acquire the valid and reliable attributes. Fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory experiment is to visualize the causal interrelationships among the attributes. Choquet integral with respect to the nonadditive attributes over the valid set provides an overall perspective function. The results establish an understanding of sustainable solid waste management barriers in the perspectives under uncertainties. Community uncertainty, policy and regulation problems, city architecture, and technology interaction are the factors that influence sustainable performance. In practices, (1) diverse disciplines and sectors in local, national, and global communities; (2) a lack of mobility and reliability; (3) mass production and mass consumption; (4) an insufficient level of artificial intelligence application; and (5) failures related to data management and security hinder the improvement of sustainable solid waste management toward society 5.0.

Nikitina; Irina M. Chernukha,"Mathematization of research is one of the most effective methods of virtual substantiation of foodstuff recipe and technology. This approach allows creating a product that meets consumer's individual needs, i.e. personalized foodstuff (ethnicity, cultural preferences, regional and environmental characteristics, lifestyle), and at the same time reducing the time and cost of decision-making. The article discusses the hypothesis that the “digital twin” of a food product is a virtual model of the product, namely its mathematical model (simulation model). A simulation model is a logical and mathematical description of a food product that is used to conduct a computerized experiment in order to design desired characteristics and properties. The “digital twin” combines all variety of factors from chemical composition, functional and technological properties to organoleptic indicators. The application of the “digital twin” model of the foodstuff will allow: (1) reacting quickly to changes in the composition, properties and types of raw ingredients, (2) adjusting the product recipe in response to changes in consumer preferences, (3) designing products with a given chemical composition, nutritional value and functional orientation, (4) creating functional, specialized products taking into account the metabolism of nutrients (ethnicity, cultural preferences, health status and clinical factors). Products adapted to the needs of small categories of people will help reducing the risks for those who already have diseases, and will meet the needs of those who would like to make their diet more appropriate to individual needs. The proposed approach to creating a model of the “digital twin” of the foodstuff includes several stages. The first stage involves optimization of the nutritional and biological value of the designed product. The second stage is related to designing the food product’s structural forms. But even if the recipe of a food product is optimally selected in the first stage, it does not guarantee its transformation during processing into a stable system with the required structural, mechanical, functional and technological parameters. Evaluation of the developed food product’s efficiency is possible only by analysing numerous and various parameters and indicators. It is convenient to generalize (convolute) many parameters and indicators into a single quantitative dimensionless indicator. To assess the quality and adequacy of the food product, it is suggested to use an integral indicator in the form of additive convolution – the ‘functional’ of the food product quality.",14,,264,270,Risk analysis (engineering); Product (category theory); Variety (cybernetics); Logical conjunction; Order (business); Recipe; Quality (business); Stable system; Personalized nutrition; Computer science,,,,,https://potravinarstvo.com/journal1/index.php/potravinarstvo/article/download/1312/1311 https://www.potravinarstvo.com/journal1/index.php/potravinarstvo/article/view/1312 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/327251658.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5219/1312,,10.5219/1312,3024914629,,0,010-801-068-494-362; 021-343-117-107-976; 043-231-504-847-933; 046-411-199-302-220; 047-330-359-539-078; 057-043-052-229-607; 077-091-580-923-813; 077-940-224-318-661; 078-551-573-944-561; 083-197-057-555-879; 095-637-572-938-905; 104-963-683-392-202; 152-664-153-882-037,2,true,cc-by,gold

The general scheme of the integrated model of sustainable and socio-humanitarian development in the global system is proposed, which the authors call the noosphere model of sustainable and safe development as an important fundamental platform for the design and creation of AIS. In the XXI century education, science and innova- tive technologies becomes the «basis» of the spiritual and material reproduction of man, transforming the society of the XXI century into an educational society, ensures compliance with the law of advanced development of human quality, quality of social intelligence and quality of educational systems in society. noosphere evolution (Субетто, 2008). Industry 4.0 is the next stage in the digitalization of production technologies with the accelerated introduction of new developments and cyberphysical systems, which is changing business models. Accordingly, Industry 4.0 as a separate segment of digital manufacturing technologies takes its place among other digital sectors. The analysis of the Strategies and Concepts developed in the world in modern directions: innovative economy, digital economy, artificial intelli- gence, Industry 4.0 and others is carried out in the work. The problem is to determine the initial fundamental para- meters of order and their prospects in the global world, the definition and principles of artificial intelligence systems (AIS), its structure and important aspects and principles of future science and technology in analysis and synthesis ba- sed on synergetic approaches, innovative, information, converged technologies, taking into account the design of future and viable and safe and sustainable development in the context of Industry 4.0, DE and Society 5.0. The main scientific and technological factors in the 21st century will be the development of: Artificial Intelligence, Nano Technologies, Bio-Media Technologies, Cognitive Technologies and Socio-Humanitarian Technologies. More specifically – this is the modern development of Innovative Technologies: «NBIC SH». Therefore, it is necessary to note the importance of taking into account the principle of I2K2+SH, ie: Intellectualization, Integration, Convergence, Coevolution and Socio- humanitarian technologies. It is important and necessary to take into account modern principles of designing a su- stainable and secure AIS and solving the problem of Harmonization between 2 worlds: Real and Virtual, especially in their hybridization. Our immediate future is a hybrid nonlinear world. Note that digitalization, artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics will be the main drivers of global economic growth by 2030E. An important paradigm and platform is the Integrated System: for Industry 4.0, DE and AI, taking into account the complex principle of I2K2+SH. If the transition of the Ukrainian economy to an innovative one does not take place in the next 3-5 years, Ukraine will remain in the backyard of civilization.</jats:p>",25,4,14,23,Engineering; Intellectualization; Structure (mathematical logic); Development (topology); Management science,,,,,https://philpapers.org/rec/SKAIA,http://dx.doi.org/10.15407/jai2020.04.014,,10.15407/jai2020.04.014,3135742340,,0,031-391-853-900-306; 037-269-969-449-640; 113-487-329-150-229,0,false,,

The innovation literature has differentiated these collaborations into informal inbound OI entry modes and formal inbound OI modes, offering an advocative and conceptual view. However, empirical studies on these collaborations are still limited.; ; ; ; ; Design/methodology/approach; ; ; ; ; Building on the above-mentioned theoretical framework, the empirical research was performed in two stages.

As an example, we looked at the resource-sharing problem typical of economic activities and assumed the distribution of individual actions to define the (1) norm function fostered through mutual comparison of value/action ratio based on the equity theory (progressive tax-like), (2) norm function proportional to resource utilization (proportional tax-like) and (3) fixed norm function independent of resource utilization (fixed tax-like). By carrying out numerical simulation, we showed that the progressive tax-like norm function (i) does not increase disparity for the distribution of the actions, unlike the other norm functions, and (ii) has high resource productivity and low Gini coefficient. Therefore the progressive tax-like norm function has the highest sustainability and fairness.",7,3,96,114,Norm (social); Mathematical optimization; Gini coefficient; Decision-making models; Mutual recognition; Resource utilization; Mathematics; Equity theory; Sustainability; Resource productivity,,,,,https://redfame.com/journal/index.php/aef/article/view/4825 https://redfame.com/journal/index.php/aef/article/download/4825/4986 https://ideas.repec.org/a/rfa/aefjnl/v7y2020i3p96-114.html https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/322535333.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.11114/aef.v7i3.4825,,10.11114/aef.v7i3.4825,3105356719; 3007379660,,0,004-545-338-240-85X; 007-191-349-791-474; 007-437-980-745-880; 010-332-589-194-999; 011-882-911-145-929; 012-962-885-974-665; 045-212-803-345-983; 054-065-378-815-209; 062-735-979-667-571; 063-725-226-097-989; 063-862-591-134-240; 070-733-823-215-158; 073-933-963-335-712; 078-341-709-997-73X; 078-362-374-834-789; 081-050-134-994-930; 086-205-801-972-088; 095-975-856-131-048; 096-623-595-192-834; 109-991-058-110-214; 124-784-188-982-725; 152-126-041-220-508; 156-193-184-347-069; 156-765-044-924-988; 159-419-280-815-190; 175-602-270-496-697,3,true,cc-by,gold

For this reason, our research goal was to analyze the key performance indicators to investigate the economic and social sustainability of the changes in production. Methodology: The combination of official (World Bank, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) and publicly available (Federal Reserve Economic Data, Industrial Federation of Robotics) data was used for statistical data processing, including comparison, correlation, cross-correlation and vector autoregression analysis, to present the past develop­ments and also to predict future trends within the U.S. manufacturing sector. Results: In contrast to robust industry robotization observed in the 2008–2018 period, the share of manufacturing output and employment declined. Nonetheless, the vector autoregression model forecast shows, that the U.S. manu­facturing sector has arrived at a turning point, after which robotization can increase employment and labor productivi­ty of workers, while also stimulating further growth of their education levels. Conclusion: The transition to Industry 4.0 has a major impact on increasing demands for new knowledge and skills for increased productivity. Accordingly, forecasted growths of analyzed manufacturing indicators suggest that negative impacts of robotization in the recent past were only temporary, due to the entrance to the Industry 4.0 era. Nonetheless, additional policies to support sustainable industry development are required.

Karo Karo; Vena Pricilia; Natasha Setiadinata,"<jats:p>AbstractBlock-chain technology has been utilized in various countries in the world, specifically in Indonesia. Block-chain brings positive impact on the development of businesses in Indonesia, but it also has negative impacts if the government of Indonesia doesn�t keep an eye on it. The Positive impacts are that block-chain can improve the efficiency of time and transactions fee. But on the other hand, block-chain gives opportunity to the beginning of cybercrime, for example data theft, client�s financial data. The formulation of problems are: 1. What is the urgency of the establishment of law concerning block-chain technology utilization in Indonesia based on the perspective of dignified justice; 2. What kind of legal protection should be established concerning consumer and business founder protection on the utilization block-chain technology. This research method is a normative empirical method conducted the way of analyzing norms, the laws and regulation on regarding the topic and with profound interviews with experts/officials who has decent knowledge in this specific area. The purpose of this research is to analyze the consumer and founder protection related on the usage of block-chain and to give an input to the ministry on the urgency of the formation of the law on blockchain in Indonesia. The results of this study are that the blockchain technology has been used in various businesses, such as financial / banking sector, agriculture, etc. Blockchain technology can change the paradigm in the financial sector from a centralized system to a decentralized system and to improve system security. Blockchain must be monitored because the blockchain system contained data privacy, financial privacy to prevent the criminal acts. The conclusion is that the supervision of the blockchain system is carried out by forming special regulations on the blockchain or adding new norms which are based on the dignified justice about blockchain in Bank Indonesia Regulations or Financial Services Authority Regulations related to financial technology.Keywords: Blockchain, Consumers Protection, Money Laundering, Renewal Law, Justice Dignity (Keadilan Bermartabat)Urgensi Pembentukan Peraturan Perundang-Undangan Terkait Teknologi Blockchain di Indonesia berdasarkan Keadilan BermartabatAbstrakTeknologi blockchain telah banyak dimanfaatkan di berbagai negara di dunia, khususnya di Indonesia. Penggunaan blockchain membawa dampak positif bagi pengembangan dunia bisnis di Indonesia, namun juga memiliki dampak negatif jika tidak diawasi oleh baik oleh Pemerintah Indonesia. Dampak positif penggunaan blockchain dapat meningkatkan efisiensi waktu, biaya lalu lintas transaksi keuangan. Namun disatu sisi, blockchain menimbulkan dampak negatif yakni membuka peluang munculnya kejahatan dunia maya (cybercrime) misalnya pencurian data privasi, data keuangan nasabah. Adapun yang menjadi rumusan masalah adalah: 1. Apakah yang menjadi urgensi pembentukan peraturan perundang-undangan terkait manfaat teknologi blockchain di Indonesia berdasarkan perspektif keadilan yang bermartabat; 2. Apa jenis perlindungan hukum yang perlu dibangun tentang perlindungan konsumer dan pelaku usaha dalam penggunaan teknologi block chain. Metode yang digunakan ialah normatif empiris yang dilakukan dengan cara menganalisis norma, peraturan perundang-undangan terhadap topik yang diangkat dan dengan metode wawancara yang mendalam kepada narasumber/pejabat yang memiliki kompetensi di bidang tersebut. Tujuan penelitian untuk menganalisis perlindungan konsumen &amp; pelaku usaha terkait penggunaan blockchain dan untuk memberi masukan bagi Kementerian terkait tentang urgensi pembentukan peraturan penggunaan blockchain di Indonesia. Hasil penelitian ini adalah teknologi blockchain telah dipergunakan di pelbagai usaha, baik di sektor keuangan/perbankan, pertanian dan lain sebagainya. Teknologi blockchain dapat merubah paradigma di sektor keuangan dari sistem sentralisasi menuju sistem desentralisasi dan untuk meningkatkan keamanan sistem. Blockchain wajib diawasi karena di dalam sistem blockchain terdapat privasi data, privasi keuangan dan agar tidak disalahgunakan untuk melakukan tindak pidana. Kesimpulannya adalah pengawasan sistem blockchain dilaksanakan dengan membentuk peraturan khusus tentang blockchain atau menambahkan norma baru yang berprinsipkan keadilan bermartabat tentang blockchain dalam Peraturan Bank Indonesia ataupun Peraturan Otoritas Jasa Keuangan yang terkait teknologi finansial.�Kata Kunci: Blockchain, Perlindungan Konsumen, Pencucian Uang, Pembaharuan Hukum, Keadilan Bermartabat</jats:p>",6,2,177,198,Economic Justice; Chain (algebraic topology); Political science; Law; Perspective (graphical); Block (telecommunications),,,,,https://journal.uniku.ac.id/index.php/unifikasi/article/view/1827 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/295436517.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.25134/unifikasi.v6i2.1827,,10.25134/unifikasi.v6i2.1827,2996937637,,0,043-294-932-561-489; 064-004-412-855-655,0,true,cc-by,gold

Mechanical elasticity analysis and damage evolution of the blade structure are the main issues in studying the behavior of composite structures, instead of that the modal and random vibration analysis are also the main of interest of studying such as dynamic structures.In this paper, methods and approaches of composite materials enhancement of WT blades are reviewed, including some numerical methods used in this context. Hence, the recent research results of WT technologies with historical results achieved are explored. This numerical models are assessed the performance of WT and optimization procedures applied to blade conception. A good attention has been paid to know about the recent optimization strategies of WT blade proposed for the engineers and researchers. Besides, the industry 5.0 involves for using AI techniques to facilitate the exploitation of numerical data from the whole numerical studies of mechanical behavior of composite materials such as elasticity, plasticity, damage initiation and damage tolerance using a well-known commercial software solver.",,,,,Turbine blade; Solver; Stiffness; Context (archaeology); Computer science; Vibration; Composite number; Structural engineering; Blade (archaeology); Modal; Turbine; Numerical analysis; Durability; Elasticity (physics); Mechanical engineering; Damage tolerance; Computer simulation,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/irsec53969.2021.9741193,,10.1109/irsec53969.2021.9741193,,,0,,2,false,,

The “Industrie 4.0” initiative declared by Germany in 2011 was soon followed by the „Advanced Manufactured Partnership” program of the U.S., as well as by the “Made in China 2025” initiative for the advancement of the productive sector launched by the People’s Republic of China and the “Industria 2016” vision of Italy. The “Society 5.0” strategy of Japan announced in 2018 symbolizes both the destructing and the constructive power of the fourth industrial revolution which will result in a complete restructuring of all fields of economy and society. The evolution of Industry 4.0 is parallel to the conscious efforts of many European governments to develop their own start-up ecosystems. These start-ups face significant challenges, but at the same time, they are the means to support changes. Technology-oriented start-up companies (also referred as early stage start-ups in Hungary) are not only expected to prove their own reason for existence, but should also support the complex changes of the corporate sector. This paper is based on a survey among early stage start-up companies, having received angel investment from technology incubators. The survey has focused on how these start-ups see of the significance of Industry 4.0, what differences are evident compared to traditional companies, and what management competencies are thought to be required to realize their growth strategy.",50,9,40,48,Humanities; Political science; Productive sector,,,,,http://unipub.lib.uni-corvinus.hu/4234/1/VT_2019n9p40.pdf http://unipub.lib.uni-corvinus.hu/4234/ https://core.ac.uk/download/228207943.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.14267/veztud.2019.09.05,,10.14267/veztud.2019.09.05,2973955768,,0,,1,true,,gold

The world of technology, mass customization, and advanced manufacturing is experiencing a rapid transformation. Robots are becoming even more important as they can now be coupled with the human mind by means of brain–machine interface and advances in artificial intelligence. A strong necessity to increase productivity while not removing human workers from the manufacturing industry is imposing punishing challenges on the global economy. To counter these challenges, this article introduces the concept of Industry 5.0, where robots are intertwined with the human brain and work as collaborator instead of competitor. This article also outlines a number of key features and concerns that every manufacturer may have about Industry 5.0. In addition, it presents several developments achieved by researchers for use in Industry 5.0 applications and environments. Finally, the impact of Industry 5.0 on the manufacturing industry and overall economy is discussed from an economic and productivity point of view, where it is argued that Industry 5.0 will create more jobs than it will take away.",11,16,4371,,Business; Manufacturing; Work (electrical); Productivity; Interface (Java); Human centric; Industrial organization; Mass customization; Advanced manufacturing; Robot,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jsusta/v11y2019i16p4371-d257067.html https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/85fc8454-bed2-3f25-8fe6-84e41d1a4497/ http://dro.deakin.edu.au/view/DU:30129578 https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/16/4371 https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/16/4371/pdf http://hdl.handle.net/10536/DRO/DU:30129578,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11164371,,10.3390/su11164371,2968770299,,0,000-440-815-151-395; 000-452-908-115-500; 000-740-216-951-555; 005-557-619-034-272; 011-811-401-279-902; 017-791-317-547-292; 024-109-329-635-758; 032-580-282-493-653; 037-866-306-495-449; 038-061-333-446-448; 042-148-232-956-867; 043-947-207-151-749; 045-862-456-705-431; 059-852-258-632-082; 069-571-787-052-595; 070-213-475-682-454; 084-809-822-579-589; 085-488-273-694-817; 095-036-132-065-895; 103-145-034-667-818; 112-201-025-044-344; 132-780-724-767-837,226,true,cc-by,gold

The study first developed and introduced the Industry 5.0 reference model that describes the technical and functional properties of this phenomenon. The study further conducted a content-centric synthesis of the literature and identified the sustainable development functions of Industry 5.0. Next, the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique was employed to identify the sequential relationships among the functions and construct the Industry 5.0-enabled model of sustainable development. The ISM involved collecting the opinions of 11 Industry 5.0 experts through expert panel meetings. Results revealed that Industry 5.0 delivers sustainable development values through 16 functions. Circular intelligent products, employee technical assistance, intelligent automation, open sustainable innovation, renewable integration, and supply chain adaptability are examples of the functions identified. These functions are highly interrelated and should be developed in a specific order so that the synergies and complementarities among them would maximize the sustainable development value gains. The roadmap to Industry 5.0-driven sustainability developed in this study is expected to provide a better understanding of ways Industry 5.0 can contribute to sustainable development, explaining how the development of its functions should be managed to maximize their synergies and contribution to the intended sustainability values. The study also highlights important avenues for future research, emphasizing the potential enablers of Industry 5.0 development, such as Government 5.0 or Corporate Governance 5.0.",33,,716,737,Sustainability; Sustainable development; Adaptability; Business; Industry 4.0; Supply chain; Industrial organization; Process management; Knowledge management; Engineering; Management science,,,,Horizon 2020; European Commission,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2022.08.003,,10.1016/j.spc.2022.08.003,,,0,003-739-483-177-307; 004-345-655-576-30X; 006-649-350-429-398; 009-851-433-625-819; 014-792-234-289-828; 014-934-290-898-725; 017-169-491-519-916; 017-415-713-662-955; 017-829-170-770-895; 023-807-371-911-412; 025-063-158-908-103; 025-485-766-400-282; 026-118-385-750-651; 027-519-650-344-683; 029-434-241-679-095; 033-851-018-944-660; 040-659-213-429-991; 042-568-416-652-13X; 047-735-862-933-748; 048-092-008-205-493; 064-138-810-036-202; 067-215-875-080-779; 070-609-833-244-587; 071-881-107-064-417; 072-759-433-132-777; 076-588-439-491-879; 078-273-948-762-696; 080-621-339-793-673; 085-402-064-678-597; 086-200-251-461-001; 090-332-878-930-771; 095-372-463-753-986; 098-221-028-633-307; 098-319-766-113-317; 104-407-152-275-456; 113-830-545-572-413; 115-035-917-580-95X; 115-664-965-881-484; 125-795-343-058-314; 136-239-393-075-894; 137-395-216-182-331; 138-332-915-687-580; 140-109-678-513-738; 142-998-026-914-988; 148-631-753-420-295; 152-707-246-845-89X; 153-662-522-509-72X; 169-612-087-067-722; 173-852-448-163-988; 190-742-604-017-384,1,true,,hybrid

Dolishniy of NAS of Ukraine,,Nataliya O. Ryvak,"<jats:p>The article addresses the main trends in the development of world industry within the framework of Industry 4.0 and the new Industry 5.0. The main prerequisites for the emergence of the Industry 5.0 concept are studied, in particular, extensive digitization and the dynamic development of technologies of the fourth industrial revolution, which has led to the certain dehumanization of industry and has increased the interest of the scientific community in the aspects of industrial humanization, human-centeredness of industry, stability, sustainability, and resilience. The main principles and trends of the development of Industry 5.0, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, geopolitical crises, and disruptions of the global value chains on the condition and prospects for the development of world industry, new rules and requirements for global product manufacturers, technological innovations, and production trends are studied. The author identifies directions for expanding the concept of Industry 4.0 to include humanization, sustainability, and resilience. The rapid development of new technologies often outpaces the ability of organizations to align their development priorities with it and effectively take advantage of new opportunities, which leads to the need to navigate the changing business environment in time and develop a relevant development strategy. With so many technological changes, changing workforce demands, and social and regulatory priorities, there is a need to define guiding principles to help set the course for the digital industry. Industry 5.0 has become the basis for revising the future of energy, manufacturing, and mobility of supply chains, which rest on the foundations laid by Industry 4.0. The weaknesses of the Industry 4.0 concept, especially in terms of the role of a human in ""smart"" production and ensuring sustainable development are outlined. Accordingly, the expediency of further research and implementation of the Industry 5.0 concept is substantiated. On the basis of the conducted research on the implementation of Industry 5.0 and the world trends of industrial development, the author justifies the feasibility of reorienting production and business activities to human-centeredness as a new norm, strengthening sustainability, in particular, careful planning of stabilization measures in case of disruption of the global value chains – from factory facilities to network supplier, to transport channels, to regulatory and geopolitical changes, ensuring sustainability with manufacturers rethinking their impact on natural resources in connection with the expansion of the regulatory and legislative framework and investors' attention to reducing carbon emissions and negative impact on the environment.</jats:p>",,3(155),41,46,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.36818/2071-4653-2022-3-7,,10.36818/2071-4653-2022-3-7,,,0,080-811-727-052-09X; 151-713-702-079-012,0,false,,

One of the changes is how people get information from a large amount of data to be used in the public development sector. Public policy, as a solution to solve various public problems, needs to be supported by accurate data and information facts. With a massive amount of data, this has an impact on public sector organizations to be able to store and analyze various types of information for public policies consideration. The term 'Society 5.0' has emerged, a concept that refers to revolution in people's lives through the use of technology by considering the humanities aspect. The potential for the huge benefits of big data technology is interesting to know as to whether big data can be used for the public policy formulation process. Therefore, this article will provide an overview of the implications of big data for the public policy process in society. This research uses qualitative method with literature study approach. The data came from websites and government documents related to the use of big data in public policies, analyzed using the NVivo12 Plus application. The emergence of big data, as a basis for making public policy, can be utilized for analysis, which includes social data analysis, historical data analysis, and predictive data analysis which can influence accuracy in the policy decision making. Public policy in the era of society 5.0 is vital to be realized through the use of big data as a source of information supported by technology and the readiness of actors in the policy-making process.",717,1,012009,,Public policy; Business; Public sector; Government; Social data analysis; Policy decision; Public relations; Process (engineering); Modernization theory; Big data,,,,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/717/1/012009 https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/717/1/012009/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/717/1/012009,,10.1088/1755-1315/717/1/012009,3156289122,,0,006-574-173-774-751; 010-329-427-568-268; 010-693-556-170-994; 011-360-018-404-299; 016-172-387-726-764; 018-145-485-196-030; 022-693-065-127-516; 025-444-259-182-777; 030-284-484-325-034; 033-656-605-806-322; 035-335-085-906-674; 044-698-440-525-155; 046-855-617-630-807; 060-167-019-499-712; 073-686-229-467-053; 089-502-739-796-203; 100-087-652-982-645; 132-414-818-360-149; 153-537-966-160-490; 157-593-008-676-380; 185-103-342-584-132,1,true,,gold

These technologies improve working conditions, create new business models, and increase both productivity and firm quality production. However, they can also improve life and society as a whole. This new perspective, oriented toward social and global well-being, is called Society 5.0. As has happened for all past industrial revolutions, Industry 4.0 will support the transition to a different society, i.e., Society 5.0. In this transition, open innovation and value co-creation can play an important role. The aim of the study was twofold: to examine how Industry 4.0 features and enabling technologies can support the transition to Society 5.0 and to investigate the roles of both open innovation and value co-creation within this transition. A conceptual framework was developed to jointly consider for the first time Industry 4.0, Society 5.0, open innovation, and value co-creation, which are all challenging issues that firms must cope with nowadays. Managers could profit from these insights to design ad hoc strategies in order to benefit from the opportunities emerging from this transition and overcome the main related challenges.",12,21,8943,,Conceptual framework; Business; Open innovation; Profit (economics); Industry 4.0; Co-creation; Industrial organization; Business model; Big data; Advanced manufacturing,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/21/8943 https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/21/8943/pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jsusta/v12y2020i21p8943-d435842.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12218943,,10.3390/su12218943,3094751573,,0,001-176-949-317-166; 001-937-465-603-426; 002-311-018-495-154; 002-411-915-669-968; 005-220-873-251-762; 006-675-752-138-373; 007-574-624-257-144; 008-302-910-246-857; 013-531-466-197-883; 015-447-374-583-278; 016-303-567-431-004; 016-774-596-734-830; 019-763-285-018-963; 020-969-308-135-679; 021-588-736-673-286; 023-935-252-395-394; 024-863-314-645-595; 025-445-829-094-029; 028-028-892-088-002; 029-333-074-857-655; 030-424-393-136-862; 031-446-952-817-490; 034-476-070-261-685; 035-231-989-556-279; 036-297-026-204-017; 036-681-732-980-212; 037-594-622-036-731; 038-964-429-089-518; 040-778-348-220-273; 040-789-926-270-357; 040-954-000-855-374; 042-622-995-382-852; 042-997-309-153-234; 044-119-959-146-339; 046-246-731-976-891; 046-382-517-518-693; 047-357-116-137-074; 052-961-258-603-888; 056-990-589-398-610; 058-666-003-191-603; 062-757-415-379-846; 063-135-384-962-122; 064-042-765-914-689; 064-542-948-840-61X; 068-490-188-515-163; 072-286-099-287-345; 073-325-440-578-871; 074-895-567-621-479; 076-991-386-599-906; 081-288-888-911-476; 081-937-750-673-601; 082-059-683-653-001; 085-300-287-100-525; 085-738-769-698-108; 087-215-530-709-098; 088-244-676-132-622; 088-281-655-337-496; 089-197-091-271-085; 092-147-288-927-925; 092-609-497-400-592; 093-670-206-119-602; 097-603-057-392-60X; 099-525-058-823-266; 100-124-216-391-558; 100-628-835-997-419; 102-443-972-671-847; 102-838-274-798-046; 106-740-230-449-952; 107-242-490-062-062; 115-847-590-573-793; 116-467-819-785-092; 117-469-885-123-201; 117-484-712-607-828; 126-473-723-473-477; 126-821-861-406-828; 134-477-067-632-705; 135-553-141-898-826; 137-059-616-282-11X; 139-204-566-527-086; 140-773-897-108-949; 144-670-467-410-017; 146-187-024-059-654; 149-269-099-266-71X; 149-531-816-526-90X; 154-889-013-873-278; 182-004-071-343-835,36,true,cc-by,gold

The main goals of digitalization are the development of innovations focused on the development of society 5.0, ensuring the free flow of data and capital. Considering the Mundell-Fleming model application as the instrument to support economic welfare it should be admitted the “impossible trinity” of the model and the lack of research to solve it. The paper investigates the Mundell-Fleming dilemma solution on the ground of digitalization. The research methodology is based on fundamental tenets of modern economics and general scientific methods, namely: induction, deduction, dialectical method and systematic approach, analysis and synthesis – all of these for analyzing the process of digitalization and to establish the principles, forms and foundations of the Mundell-Fleming model application in the digital dimension, systematization and generalization (to substantiate the phenomenon of digitalization), abstract-logical method (for recent tendencies substantiation), economic-mathematical (to compare and analyze data), institutional-comparative (for the analysis Mundell-Fleming model application in the digital economy). The paper studies the Mundell-Fleming model application in digital economy, it investigates global trends as well as peculiarities of digitalization in Ukrainian economy. We believe digitalization is the instrument to solve the Mundell-Fleming trilemma.

In this research paper, the author intended to define and examine the relationship and impact of construction productivity (CP) over construction project performance (CPP). The author tests the proposition that there is a positive relationship/impact between both of them. And to test the effect of factors is affecting CP on CPP and to propose a conceptual model on the basis of the analysis. To validate the mathematical validity of factor analysis, Spearman correlation analysis has been performed on the factors. And to check the reliability of all the factors using reliability analysis, and finally test the hypothesis that construction productivity is having a positive impact on project performance using one sample t-test. The findings of the study concluded that there is a positive impact of construction productivity on project performance in Indian construction projects. This paper attempts to identify the relationship between CP and CPP and recommends the framework for the industry to grow sustainably and deliver projects successfully.

With Industry 4.0 being unable to address and meet increased drive of personalization, the term Industry 5.0 was coined for addressing personalized manufacturing and empowering humans in manufacturing processes. The onset of the term Industry 5.0 is observed to have various views of how it is defined and what constitutes the reconciliation between humans and machines. This serves as the motivation of this paper in identifying and analyzing the various themes and research trends of what Industry 5.0 is using text mining tools and techniques. Toward this, the abstracts of 196 published papers based on the keyword “Industry 5.0” search in IEEE, science direct and MDPI data bases were extracted. Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed for further analysis to apply text mining techniques of key terms extraction and frequency analysis. Further topic mining i.e., unsupervised machine learning method was used for exploring the data. It is observed that the terms artificial intelligence (AI), big data, supply chain, digital transformation, machine learning, internet of things (IoT), are among the most often used and among several enablers that have been identified by researchers to drive Industry 5.0. Five major themes of Industry 5.0 addressing, supply chain evaluation and optimization, enterprise innovation and digitization, smart and sustainable manufacturing, transformation driven by IoT, AI, and Big Data, and Human-machine connectivity were classified among the published literature, highlighting the research themes that can be further explored. It is observed that the theme of Industry 5.0 as a gateway towards human machine connectivity and co-existence is gaining more interest among the research community in the recent years.</jats:p>",5,1,27,27,Big data; Digitization; Industry 4.0; Automation; Computer science; Data science; Identification (biology); Personalization; Digital transformation; Supply chain; Manufacturing; Industrial Revolution; Data pre-processing; Artificial intelligence; Knowledge management,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/asi5010027,,10.3390/asi5010027,,,0,007-805-294-452-363; 014-701-830-171-774; 014-934-290-898-725; 017-415-713-662-955; 018-320-239-571-451; 024-494-460-611-587; 027-188-932-616-882; 027-519-650-344-683; 028-449-924-497-640; 029-087-799-772-164; 033-965-786-944-095; 039-236-353-346-581; 039-547-585-466-302; 042-903-381-502-080; 044-628-273-462-359; 044-998-373-851-683; 045-021-026-328-000; 046-819-137-590-094; 047-486-990-455-440; 048-092-008-205-493; 049-534-371-095-200; 049-816-999-056-296; 050-940-763-389-186; 057-110-051-295-255; 057-727-174-826-765; 058-724-297-819-998; 059-651-423-638-701; 067-215-875-080-779; 069-133-957-040-416; 070-609-833-244-587; 073-449-782-412-059; 075-188-830-741-966; 075-662-363-625-645; 076-991-386-599-906; 080-444-539-645-101; 083-256-551-682-432; 084-067-257-212-804; 085-056-587-927-434; 094-019-830-401-584; 101-407-888-546-440; 106-219-551-506-80X; 113-890-075-887-027; 117-455-364-766-44X; 124-064-639-371-099; 131-968-199-726-102; 132-974-802-685-77X; 138-332-915-687-580; 146-536-286-495-045; 153-560-894-890-798; 154-882-045-080-430; 162-124-681-890-431; 170-988-797-789-464; 175-919-077-874-030; 181-601-884-521-300; 198-555-263-184-447,10,true,cc-by,gold

Japan's Society 5.0 needs to be discussed because the global aspect of Japan's Society 5.0, namely the spread via the internet and Google, has not been researched widely. Even though, the Government of Japan committed as a role model for the world with Society 5.0 . The method used in this article is a case study with data from Google Trends. The concept used is the globalization from Thomas Friedman. The results of this article show that the topic of Japan's Society 5.0 has attracted foreign public attention in several countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, India, and the United States. Then, the public in these countries also used Google to find out topics related to Japan's Society 5.0. For example, the topics of society, industry, the industrial revolution, and Industry 4.0. The spread of Japan's Society 5.0 topic in various countries can be stated in line with Thomas Friedman's argumentation on globalization which is centered on Information and Communications Technology (ICT) development. Artikel ini berupaya untuk mendeskripsikan penyebaran topik Society 5.0 Jepang di luar Jepang berdasarkan hasil pencarian Google pada tahun 2019. Society 5.0 Jepang perlu untuk dibahas karena aspek global dari Society 5.0 Jepang yaitu penyebaran melalui internet dan Google belum terlalu dikaji secara luas. Padahal, Pemerintah Jepang memiliki komitmen untuk menjadi percontohan bagi dunia dengan Society 5.0 . Metode yang digunakan dalam artikel ini adalah studi kasus dengan data dari Google Trends. Konsep yang digunakan adalah globalisasi dari Thomas Friedman. Hasil artikel ini memperlihatkan topik Society 5.0 Jepang menjadi perhatian publik asing di beberapa negara seperti Indonesia, Malaysia, India, dan Amerika Serikat. Lalu, publik di negara-negara tersebut juga menggunakan Google untuk mencari tahu topik yang terkait dengan Society 5.0 Jepang. Contohnya adalah topik masyarakat, industri, revolusi industri, dan Industry 4.0 . Penyebaran topik Society 5.0 Jepang di berbagai negara dapat dinyatakan sejalan dengan argumentasi globalisasi dari Thomas Friedman yang berpusat pada perkembangan Teknologi Informasi dan Komunikasi (TIK).",9,1,61,82,,,,,,http://ajis.fisip.unand.ac.id/index.php/ajis/article/download/307/139 http://ajis.fisip.unand.ac.id/index.php/ajis/article/view/307 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/327261186.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.25077/ajis.9.1.61-82.2020,,10.25077/ajis.9.1.61-82.2020,3047295660,,0,,0,true,cc-by-nc-sa,gold

N. Neplyuev in the 1880s, 30 km to North of Glukhov. It shows the socio-economic successes that the community could achieve in the production and social spheres. Educational innovations, due to which young brothers were brought up, are characterized: the need for constant practical application of innovative technologies and methods of work, reproduction of motives for self-learning and obtaining new knowledge, conditionality of constant decision-making, self-organization and self-government, etc. Methods of organization, social relations, approach to production activities along which the Brotherhood lived, days with the present. In particular, the focus of the Brotherhood's economy on the use of renewable resources and ensuring the sustainable state of adjacent ecosystems brings it closer to the goals and objectives of the Third Industrial Revolution, which is now taking place in the world. The priority of information production in the Brotherhood and its focus on the mechanization of labor processes make it clearer the logics of the modern Fourth Industrial Revolution clearer. And, finally, the invaluable achievement of the brothers is the priority they have achieved of a human personality development. This is what is now becoming essential in the light of the Fifth Industrial Revolution. It is especially noted that the Brotherhood, thanks to its educational system, managed to create a unique reproductive potential, which included: a system of necessary self-reproduction of human personalities; system of reproduction of the most effective use and reproduction of natural capital; system of reproduction of synergetic combination of human, natural and physical capitals.</jats:p>",,3,98,116,Political science; Economic growth,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.21272/mer.2020.89.08,http://dx.doi.org/10.21272/mer.2020.89.08,,10.21272/mer.2020.89.08,3134623455,,0,,0,true,,green

However, a survey on 64 studies shows a wide variation of the correlation between customer satisfaction and financial performance. The correlation coefficients are varied from -0.256 to 0.899. This study applies a meta-analysis on those 64 studies’ findings to find the true correlation between customer satisfaction and financial performance. The analysis clusters the 64 studies based on year of research, business category observed, and geographical area of research. The result shows that the correlation between customer satisfaction and financial performance is relatively high (0.525) before 1990, becomes confusing (not-significantly correlated) in 1991-2000, increases (0.626) in 2001-2010, and decreases (0.595) after 2011. Based on business category, the two variables are not significantly correlated both in manufacturing industries and in service industries. The two variables are significantly correlated according to the studies conducted in Europe region (0.566) and Asia-Africa (0.657), but could not to be proven significantly correlated in USA region. The insights from the meta-analysis findings are: (1) the customer satisfaction role is change by time as well as the changes of industry environment, so that research on customer satisfaction will always be beneficial; (2) in individualist society like USA, further researches on customer behavior and culture are required to find more clear explanation about the role of customer satisfaction as well as other financial success factors, on the company performance. </jats:p>",1,1,37,48,Business; Marketing; Customer satisfaction; Lead (geology); Meta-analysis,,,,,http://ojs.uajy.ac.id/index.php/IJIEEM/article/viewFile/2295/1397 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/229551019.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.24002/ijieem.v1i1.2295,,10.24002/ijieem.v1i1.2295,2973255139,,0,,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

In this respect, the implementation of the circular economy model, which requires engineers to acquire appropriate competencies, enabling companies to establish this model at the manufacturing level. Moreover, competence has always been a priority for both the professional and the company. In this sense, connectivism has been called a learning theory for the digital era; this is the reason why a review of the state-of-the-art developments of this paradigm focused on engineering has been carried out. In this sense, the potential of the digital transformation in instruction to formulate an engineering model based on neuro-competences is of great interest, taking the connectivist paradigm as a methodological axis. To this end, a first bibliometric analysis has been carried out to identify the drivers on which to base the design of the neuro-competencies of the instructional engineering environment and the trend towards curriculum development under dual training models. The bibliographical research carried out on the connectivist paradigm has served to identify the trends followed to date in education within the subject area of engineering. These trends have not fully taken into account the leading role of the human factor within the socio-technical cyber-physical systems of sustainable manufacturing (SCSSM). The focus was more on the technology than on the adaptation of the uniqueness of the human factor and the tasks entrusted to him, which entails an additional complexity that needs to be addressed in both academic and professional contexts. In light of the foregoing, an improvement to the acquisition and management of competencies has been proposed to the academic, professional and dual engineering contexts. It is based on the transversal inclusion of the concept of neuro-competence applied to the competence engineering (CE) model, transforming it into the neuro-competence engineering (NCE) model. The foregoing provides a better match between the characteristics of the human factor and the uniqueness of the tasks performed by the engineer, incorporating activity theory (AT), the law of variety required (LVR), the connectivist paradigm and neuroscience as a transversal driver of innovation through fractality. This proposal enables a ubiquitous and sustainable learning model throughout the entire academic and professional life cycle of the engineer, placing it sustainably at the heart of the instructional and professional cyber-physical socio-technical system, thus complying with the SDGs set by the UN and Horizon 2030.",13,8,4389,,Competence (human resources); Engineering management; Digital transformation; Variety (cybernetics); Sustainable engineering; Computer science; Sustainable development; Adaptation (computer science); Connectivism; Learning theory,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/8/4389 https://idus.us.es/handle/11441/107944 https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/8/4389/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13084389,,10.3390/su13084389,3156997439,,0,000-248-934-782-51X; 000-257-060-937-828; 002-052-422-936-00X; 002-764-082-187-051; 003-190-318-217-736; 007-066-362-009-544; 010-188-454-033-318; 011-560-980-705-529; 011-803-200-068-324; 012-504-862-865-628; 016-281-638-643-238; 016-309-090-086-107; 017-557-569-036-776; 018-643-065-555-350; 019-114-632-117-748; 020-249-263-884-768; 021-013-375-151-716; 021-269-212-641-621; 023-211-964-243-520; 025-288-994-858-057; 027-228-321-743-026; 029-534-629-933-801; 030-447-833-209-52X; 030-997-397-302-643; 032-252-814-985-358; 033-739-242-312-502; 041-064-879-430-933; 042-271-946-455-320; 043-368-123-643-192; 046-934-025-340-190; 051-769-551-477-060; 052-453-807-944-116; 053-526-343-911-279; 053-530-162-809-509; 056-490-188-922-097; 057-021-476-215-834; 057-888-766-237-54X; 058-082-551-642-71X; 058-485-225-720-635; 061-472-007-804-49X; 061-508-236-488-840; 065-103-750-376-489; 065-578-638-556-075; 069-211-190-470-592; 070-176-205-149-166; 070-580-919-519-258; 072-175-378-404-493; 073-227-605-513-031; 074-525-653-012-188; 077-068-317-696-523; 080-599-783-436-156; 089-758-833-541-839; 092-955-685-410-706; 095-834-465-737-393; 098-622-889-694-985; 107-267-433-837-301; 110-309-926-544-567; 113-724-467-093-61X; 116-278-715-717-914; 117-796-521-512-888; 119-730-544-716-817; 119-925-985-130-432; 126-660-588-062-133; 130-123-548-819-526; 136-967-015-884-024; 138-143-336-920-066; 138-529-852-670-835; 139-628-237-366-583; 139-649-663-651-283; 140-017-694-094-643; 145-594-768-943-946; 149-893-976-597-748; 151-067-699-992-99X; 151-658-446-530-089; 152-662-394-943-92X; 164-678-142-538-444; 168-776-736-332-587,3,true,cc-by,gold

INTEGRATION. EDUCATION. Proceedings of the International Scientific Conference,22560629; 16915887,Rezekne Academy of Technologies,,Vilma Sukackė,"Technology acceptance model (TAM) is arguably the most widely used intention theory that explains the individual’s acceptance of a certain technology.  Since Davis introduced TAM in 1986, it has been applied and validated in a variety of disciplines, including educational sciences. However, scholars note that depending on a specific context, the original TAM needs to be extended, which has been done by introducing external variables and other theories. Despite the existent TAM2 and TAM3, numerous scholars still opt for the original TAM, extending it with the variables and theories that are relevant to the specific context of their study. The aim of the present paper is to provide an overview of validated TAM extensions, which might later help to further the understanding of educational technology acceptance, which is a prerequisite of its adoption. Since interdisciplinarity in various contexts is becoming more and more common, the overview presents TAM extensions that come from a number of different disciplines. The overview is based on 108 papers that were retrieved from the Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics) by searching for the keywords ‘extended Technology Acceptance Model’, ‘extended TAM’, and ‘TAM extension’.",5,,525,549,Variety (cybernetics); Educational technology; Technology acceptance model; Context (language use); Computer science; External variable; Knowledge management; Analytics,,,,,http://conferences.rta.lv/index.php/SIE/SIE2019/paper/view/2581 http://journals.ru.lv/index.php/SIE/article/view/3798 http://journals.rta.lv/index.php/SIE/article/download/3798/3991 https://conferences.rta.lv/index.php/SIE/SIE2019/paper/viewPaper/2581 http://journals.rta.lv/index.php/SIE/article/view/3798 http://journals.ru.lv/index.php/SIE/article/download/3798/3991 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/276269870.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17770/sie2019vol5.3798,,10.17770/sie2019vol5.3798,2948659000,,0,000-060-417-634-426; 000-192-241-807-657; 001-896-044-157-028; 002-009-009-314-502; 002-524-455-455-15X; 002-738-315-542-28X; 003-084-551-080-976; 003-461-282-889-670; 004-087-642-395-666; 005-114-489-891-90X; 006-743-551-051-96X; 008-886-823-294-879; 010-345-302-201-833; 011-254-643-589-955; 012-324-673-515-380; 012-713-901-916-696; 012-736-223-459-933; 013-438-143-646-641; 014-337-672-859-478; 014-945-938-187-795; 016-006-036-762-399; 024-931-263-968-838; 027-772-352-481-03X; 029-104-798-516-814; 031-350-654-437-485; 031-446-952-817-490; 031-488-990-263-674; 032-216-176-656-243; 032-946-419-602-253; 033-665-693-191-608; 034-957-011-165-180; 035-738-341-937-370; 038-911-250-952-554; 039-266-603-533-644; 039-719-033-455-961; 041-346-896-921-799; 042-194-475-698-783; 044-244-831-012-940; 044-531-016-882-263; 045-238-259-927-490; 046-011-306-766-328; 046-608-623-604-981; 047-105-400-407-261; 050-158-145-908-92X; 051-121-185-513-380; 051-358-632-280-01X; 055-410-359-369-400; 058-081-424-637-980; 058-201-676-676-656; 058-291-772-009-919; 060-286-799-044-365; 061-259-165-674-448; 061-773-356-664-789; 063-014-737-157-460; 065-195-970-958-916; 065-761-785-191-85X; 067-624-070-521-861; 067-963-675-792-046; 069-629-164-625-835; 070-109-513-692-451; 070-228-166-005-742; 070-892-410-747-445; 071-323-768-093-526; 072-654-117-180-055; 074-985-907-567-667; 075-533-093-091-514; 078-772-545-287-938; 078-835-256-720-171; 080-768-432-037-596; 083-026-769-368-91X; 085-162-169-894-691; 086-754-909-661-136; 093-474-817-290-531; 098-109-450-765-030; 099-287-847-734-118; 105-083-572-143-597; 108-194-471-442-679; 111-967-642-990-937; 112-966-943-064-437; 114-123-671-516-221; 114-556-841-480-844; 116-196-815-757-148; 116-654-675-004-149; 117-817-762-502-656; 118-103-312-124-303; 119-401-692-120-989; 122-589-788-943-520; 122-781-429-944-652; 135-167-153-922-058; 143-875-130-007-110; 144-449-085-891-625; 144-490-339-181-872; 151-720-506-951-323; 156-878-325-309-19X; 159-374-486-295-921; 160-963-018-696-67X; 163-637-734-144-951; 175-558-529-260-056; 176-351-246-035-770; 184-086-986-348-962; 190-680-485-510-350; 199-489-396-833-723,1,true,,

Today the need of expansion in businesses directly leads to adoption of new concepts of manufacturing and also making awareness of those used processes to ultimate consumers is needed. Industry 4.0 is related to the processes with latest technologies such as clean-green energy, automation, internet of things (IoT) and digitization, whereas, green manufacturing is almost similar like use of fewer natural resources, reduction in pollution &amp; waste, reducing carbon footprints, recycle &amp; reuse of material and moderate emission in processes. Country’s sustainable growth right now is major among other strategies and every country is trying and working hard to incorporate the development process through adoption of these types of tools &amp; techniques. Industry 4.0 technologies and green manufacturing relate to “Green Dialogue” and to some extent proving the object also. Now, introduction of Industry 5.0 is welcoming fully fledged automation of industries with green processes like G-IoT. However, climate health, consumers health and production &amp; operation health is on priority to have healthier green clean sustainable development in the world. From the above title, the purpose of this study is to present the potential of the industries; under new industrial revolution with the combination to eco-friendly manufacturing leading to knowledge of the updated technologies used for their respective ecological production &amp; operation management. These concepts are considered to be new around the world and most of the developed countries are more active in accepting these; sustainable concepts in their operations and production in industries. Developing countries like India are way behind in acquiring these concepts as manufacturing is aware but not willing to pay extra cost of production in advancing the operation &amp; production process. Most of the top manufacturers of India have already started using this sustainable process as they have to prove their responsibility towards society at large by Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) also.</jats:p>",17,1,,,Digitization; Business; Manufacturing; Sustainable development; Production (economics); Automation; Manufacturing engineering; Engineering; Industrial organization,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.51220/jmr.v17i1.9,,10.51220/jmr.v17i1.9,,,0,,0,false,,

This development entails that job transformations and future skills need attention from the perspective of industry 5.0, where human and machine find ways of working together to improve production performance. Facing this perspective, one challenge is a growing need for novel lifelong learning initiatives, to meet emerging and altering occupations for the fulfilment of future skill requirements. This challenge is addressed here by portraying a case where three Swedish universities have formed a distinctive collaboration to develop a flexible (i.e. blended) course for professionals, in the subject of Digitally-enabled production. The purpose is to develop a sustainable collaboration between the universities and create a course format on master level addressing lifelong learning for the increasingly digitalized production. The ambition is to increase the impact of the universities respective efforts by sharing resources and utilizing individual specialized expertise to develop a practical and relevant course that can reach a larger target group. The course encompasses industry 4.0 readiness on three levels of production systems; plant-, production cell-, and component level; to adopt a holistic view of digitalization in production. We followed an action research approach for continuously collecting and documenting our experiences during the course development, implementation, and dissemination of the course. Within the frame of action research, an explorative case study describes and analyzes the initiative. The results highlight challenges and opportunities for succeeding with this form of co-produced course. The joint course gives professionals possibilities to work on cases from their own companies with expert supervision from three manufacturing levels to address complex challenges in industry 4.0 implementation. To conclude, the importance of lifelong learning in relation to the human-centric approach of industry 5.0 is emphasized as a future direction.</jats:p>",,,,,Lifelong learning; Production (economics); Knowledge management; Engineering; Perspective (graphical); Action (physics); Engineering ethics; Business; Engineering management,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/atde220184,,10.3233/atde220184,,,0,,0,true,,gold

In this context, which is characterized by a large gap between training and operative processes, a dedicated method is required to manage and extract the massive amount of data and the related information mining. The method presented in this work aims to reduce this gap with near-zero-failure advanced diagnostics (AD) for smart management, which is exploitable in any context of Society 5.0, thus reducing the risk factors at all management levels and ensuring quality and sustainability. We have also developed innovative applications for a human-centered management system to support scheduling in the maintenance of operative processes, for reducing training costs, for improving production yield, and for creating a human–machine cyberspace for smart infrastructure design. The results obtained in 12 international companies demonstrate a possible global standardization of operative processes, leading to the design of a near-zero-failure intelligent system that is able to learn and upgrade itself. Our new method provides guidance for selecting the new generation of intelligent manufacturing and smart systems in order to optimize human–machine interactions, with the related smart maintenance and education.",6,7,835,846,Scheduling (computing); Artificial intelligence; Smart system; Standardization; Management system; Quality (business); Context (language use); Cyberspace; Computer science; Big data,,,,Grant 2017; Cariparma Foundation; Department of Medicine and Surgery; CSEIA,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095809920300266 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2095809920300266 https://doaj.org/article/3f55db5b87c9467da9dd400862a40b76 https://air.unipr.it/handle/11381/2872548,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eng.2019.11.014,,10.1016/j.eng.2019.11.014,3003162042,,0,000-695-624-225-501; 001-323-429-375-458; 001-462-248-576-023; 003-821-070-459-763; 007-863-302-831-562; 009-925-932-430-898; 012-373-473-281-736; 013-308-381-667-776; 015-179-947-788-927; 020-680-911-838-355; 022-380-596-265-048; 022-883-462-323-85X; 024-301-292-916-563; 024-533-356-605-434; 024-686-978-205-387; 025-508-842-268-05X; 028-232-581-949-707; 029-088-494-457-336; 029-522-085-058-640; 029-761-682-813-729; 030-139-354-389-282; 031-506-949-907-374; 032-055-105-686-264; 033-463-729-344-544; 036-048-873-809-458; 043-866-693-114-286; 045-936-475-493-242; 048-827-579-519-108; 050-803-018-211-918; 051-118-827-089-028; 051-969-387-725-363; 052-227-014-472-221; 054-971-734-581-504; 057-034-975-930-616; 063-483-909-050-195; 071-473-279-124-057; 074-482-942-286-276; 078-505-826-257-819; 079-796-431-947-902; 080-900-769-184-108; 082-444-578-495-751; 084-640-871-954-292; 085-710-989-349-829; 088-286-897-179-745; 095-657-169-699-869; 097-115-411-543-915; 098-276-959-684-741; 098-621-664-553-79X; 100-124-216-391-558; 106-971-451-537-030; 113-688-605-343-205; 113-844-783-102-633; 118-370-935-746-471; 129-718-596-982-317; 137-321-353-227-821; 140-478-325-778-398; 141-520-178-697-83X; 146-119-252-820-906; 156-099-468-912-647; 165-778-127-427-88X; 168-757-667-266-956; 170-343-790-752-628; 174-539-731-574-243; 175-785-932-198-352,51,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

Romanova; Dmitry V. Sirotin,"<jats:p>Industrialisation remains the major factor of development in the era of radical changes. Its drivers – advanced digital production technologies – are transforming the entire industrial and spatial landscape. Industrial regions take a special role in these transformations. The research aims to identify trends in the development of basic industries in industrial regions and work out a method to form their new technological image. Methodologically, the study relies on the institutional theory, theories of sustainable and longterm technical and economic development; applies methods of comparative, statistical, structural analysis and neural network modelling. Considering the case of the Ural metal industries, the study reveals the main trends of development and possibilities of forming the image of future of the basic industries of Russia’s industrial regions, as well as specifies the factors that modify these trends under the New Normal. Due to institutional and technological transformations, the Russian metal industries have achieved impregnable positions in the world market. The paper substantiates the changes in the development of the basic industries linked with the formation of Industry 5.0 as the new management paradigm, which assigns priority to the ESG factors. The research demonstrates that an indispensable condition for the successful functioning of companies is the ability to cooperate and agree on decisions. The findings confirm that modernised metal and other basic industries through integrating green, digital and behavioural economy will not only maintain, but are likely to increase their importance in the economy of industrial regions.</jats:p>",23,2,9,28,Industrialisation; Industrial organization; Business; Sustainable development; Economic system; Regional science; Computer science; Economic geography,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.29141/2658-5081-2022-23-2-1,,10.29141/2658-5081-2022-23-2-1,,,0,003-682-809-618-463; 019-218-091-890-573; 020-191-419-063-87X; 028-638-803-907-298; 032-789-188-529-821; 035-253-870-973-574; 042-293-327-072-344; 049-630-935-658-823; 052-162-157-249-567; 053-211-367-558-338; 060-295-480-322-014; 063-891-616-996-756; 069-166-891-026-427; 071-596-620-879-761; 079-284-096-761-588; 082-550-423-767-715; 089-975-648-983-935; 095-589-362-164-725; 101-402-844-565-479; 121-580-763-708-56X; 130-447-246-822-317; 174-934-407-787-976; 186-735-012-000-298,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Japan, as one of the leading countries in technological innovations, is the most advanced in terms of approach to digital society. Japanese society and government have been working on a new concept of life where all the digital technologies will communicate through the internet. Society organised in this way is called Society 5.0 - super Smart society. In Japan, this concept is centred about seventeen sustainable goals (United Nations, 2018). Society 5.0 is a reaction to the fundamental technological revolutionary changes known today as Industry 4.0. Thus, Society 5.0 is the consequence of a technological revolution that will eventually affect not just the production but all parts of today's life as well.The new technologies evoke some fundamental philosophical and existential questions. How can technological advances improve the prosperity and functioning of society? What about the privacy and security of all the users?

This has resulted in University Technology Transfer (UTT) taking place within an increasingly complex network of regional stakeholders. This complexity has resulted in quadruple helix models where the triple helix model of academia, industry and regional government now includes societal based innovation users as a fourth helix. Despite this development, extant research is fragmented and lacks coherent frameworks and conceptualisations which fully depict the dynamic and evolving nature of UTT. Accordingly, this article reviews Mode 2 UTT from a quadruple helix perspective to identify key themes to develop a research agenda which reflects progression from a triple into a quadruple helix ecosystem.",48,1,7,24,Triple helix; Government; Political science; Management; Systematic review; Perspective (graphical); Technology transfer; Quadruple helix; Mode 2; Knowledge management; End user,,,,,https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/en/publications/a-systematic-literature-review-of-university-technology-transfer--3 http://doras.dcu.ie/23825/ http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/radm.12228/full https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/en/publications/a-systematic-literature-review-of-university-technology-transfer--4 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/radm.12228 https://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/a-systematic-literature-review-of-university-technology-transfer-from-a-quadruple-helix-perspective-towards-a-research-agenda(8f375051-ac87-4244-99b1-cf75ad4c6cdc)/export.html https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3094117 https://core.ac.uk/download/74405052.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/radm.12228,,10.1111/radm.12228,2512358365,,0,001-218-752-217-738; 001-588-065-749-626; 001-793-961-245-947; 002-529-702-064-475; 002-910-853-396-103; 003-464-864-294-558; 003-995-845-479-955; 006-360-473-535-628; 006-407-325-662-153; 006-810-486-549-434; 008-568-541-949-263; 012-074-095-978-447; 012-191-011-422-306; 013-159-485-219-154; 015-276-436-539-843; 015-845-606-711-827; 018-918-549-280-170; 021-802-181-302-59X; 024-072-021-338-769; 026-635-844-256-165; 027-133-011-502-196; 033-727-858-183-392; 036-274-626-792-383; 036-285-006-299-516; 037-577-649-602-890; 038-040-571-925-521; 043-459-391-987-50X; 043-859-587-533-166; 049-514-992-846-857; 049-583-324-306-942; 050-140-511-135-504; 050-314-118-587-261; 051-620-137-104-909; 052-553-276-350-498; 057-553-555-783-394; 058-187-279-002-027; 059-274-407-495-754; 064-522-769-390-715; 064-770-023-631-28X; 067-606-758-808-693; 068-627-604-031-34X; 068-836-749-402-210; 069-878-836-875-085; 070-186-869-942-369; 071-887-324-635-770; 072-270-188-920-150; 072-582-540-989-660; 072-745-335-055-90X; 072-825-764-455-047; 073-429-587-876-650; 073-838-075-391-85X; 073-868-973-630-207; 075-639-472-070-33X; 078-421-247-919-795; 078-565-590-541-227; 078-757-494-993-625; 079-384-320-708-764; 082-777-532-476-710; 084-662-890-688-775; 085-106-818-998-84X; 085-300-287-100-525; 086-387-291-703-856; 086-870-852-943-690; 090-479-393-475-623; 094-407-405-677-779; 094-913-369-084-870; 095-634-123-121-592; 096-252-584-668-622; 099-205-315-606-05X; 101-224-404-255-478; 103-943-565-803-379; 104-980-736-274-934; 105-104-311-320-807; 110-545-874-743-074; 111-168-723-616-073; 111-764-490-617-841; 113-242-639-307-214; 115-222-439-208-97X; 116-245-043-687-968; 116-820-086-399-710; 117-122-284-038-527; 120-094-718-338-889; 130-177-967-697-870; 130-225-855-797-90X; 131-338-814-630-502; 136-751-658-577-439; 141-946-119-347-563; 149-399-321-037-885; 150-174-905-824-952; 150-967-971-620-456; 155-431-528-320-746; 156-400-087-782-834; 160-606-043-902-329; 161-985-030-766-38X; 166-429-203-555-332; 168-347-621-793-775; 176-554-029-089-73X; 181-239-695-220-77X,161,true,,green

The application of widespread digitization of processes brings changes in terms of increased efficiency of processes, increased flexibility of production, and the possibility of realizing prosocial and pro-ecological goals, such as sustainable development, sustainable production and consumption, and reducing the consumption of increasingly expensive energy. Nowadays, the high autonomy of cyber-physical systems and benefits to society are expected by including human factors within the Industry 5.0 concept. Implementing the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies and meeting the expectations of sustainable development also means new challenges for the knowledge and skills of industry employees, mainly engineers implementing modern solutions. Hence, the article’s aim is to identify the critical knowledge and skills of engineers responsible for implementing the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies. The achievements and results presented in the article were obtained based on research conducted among experts from the University of Pennsylvania (USA).

The previous revolutions have all been designed on the idea of creating newer technologies and have thereby chanced upon editing the flaws which comes with creating but the newest Industry 4.0 deals with taking whatever technology is already present in the market and actively removing all the clutter associated with it which eventually makes this process an innovation through and through. In spite of innovating upon the base technology to build processes for a better industrial future, there are some problems which do not have a clear-cut solution and this is where Fuzzy mathematical modeling comes into play.;  Moreover, with talks of Industry 5.0 surfacing, which is considered as the age of robots, a robot is given clear cut instructions as to a manufacturing process even in an uncertain environment.

At present, business organization are moving towards Industry 5.0 (internet of thought) and GIG economy where the traditional way of fully relying on full time workers are no longer relevant. The world of work is changing. From organizational view, leap frogging strategy with technological advancement are significant to achieve competitive advantage to ensure the continuity of business. While from worker perspective, having technology driven talent is a must to face new business economy called as GIG economy. In other words, all workers in every industry including logistics should ensure they have technology driven talent in his/her portfolio to remain competitive in the working world. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the applicability of Industry 5.0 such as digitalization and mobile marketing to logistics players; to make them more visible to customer and competitor. Single case study method was adopted to study on the perspective as discussed above more in-depth. Findings from this single case study is transferable as it provides rich explanation and discussion from one of the earliest logistics company in Malaysia, with logistics experience almost five (5) decades in providing logistics services. The qualitative findings pointed out four key areas for LSP improvement. Firstly, all LSPs should go for transition process with their business model to provide them with new revenue - logistics digital business and allow them to be more visible to their customer by fully utilizing the promotion activities online. Secondly, every agreement with customer should be put into contract and it is paperless within system. Thirdly, digital payment is a must to all logistics players to practice in order for them to compete in digital era. Finally, and inevitability, to sustain in the business, logistics may move to become intelligent logistics players with carrying no asset and just focus on negotiating contracts with customers. This term refers to practising logistics players with no assets or less assets centric. In principle, the company does not own asset but able to provide logistics services (for example fleet and warehouses) by aggregating â€œinformation about assetsâ€ from people who do own them by leveraging on data. This article contributes to the logistics study by matching issue on digitalization and GIG economy in logistics sector. More work on future of logistics is needed with large sample across the globe in order to obtain more data to help the logistics players depict themselves in new economy.",8,2,1042,1048,Supply chain; Business; Revenue; New economy; Portfolio; Industrial organization; Business model; Competitive advantage; Promotion (rank); Asset (computer security),,,,,https://ojs.excelingtech.co.uk/index.php/IJSCM/article/download/3085/1597 https://ojs.excelingtech.co.uk/index.php/IJSCM/article/view/3085/1597,https://ojs.excelingtech.co.uk/index.php/IJSCM/article/view/3085/1597,,,2944939807,,0,,5,false,,

It has also freed business activity from a focus on place, as both work activities and markets have been able to harness information and communication technologies in order to operate remotely. As a result, researchers have highlighted a phenomenon of ‘smart’ working. Some have pointed to a fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) in which ‘smart’ factories use robotics to achieve high performance. There is now a suggestion of progress towards Industry 5.0, in which technological and social systems work in harmony to deliver personalised mass customization of products and services. This paper examines these developments from the perspective of unique, individual understandings of work roles and sustainability, posing the questions ‘Smart’ from whose point of view? Do smart systems promote sustainable organizations? How should design of smart systems be approached? It suggests that contemporary socio-technical systems approaches to organizational analysis are the best way to support harnessing of smart technologies in organizations.",22,2,281,298,Engineering; Sociotechnical system; Smart system; Organizational analysis; Sustainability organizations; Industry 4.0; Knowledge management; Sustainability; Information and Communications Technology; Mass customization,,,,University of Portsmouth,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:spr:infosf:v:22:y:2020:i:2:d:10.1007_s10796-019-09921-1 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10796-019-09921-1.pdf https://www.scilit.net/article/045597f38ab8e46bd3e4b6ef2cbd057d https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/isf/isf22.html#BednarW20 https://doi.org/10.1007/s10796-019-09921-1 https://portal.research.lu.se/en/publications/socio-technical-perspectives-on-smart-working-creating-meaningful https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/1ce530bd-2aa7-409e-b2b6-522a6b7c57b0 https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/portal/files/14211480/Socio_Technical_Perspectives_on_Smart_Working.pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/infosf/v22y2020i2d10.1007_s10796-019-09921-1.html https://puredev.port.ac.uk/en/publications/socio-technical-perspectives-on-smart-working-creating-meaningful https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10796-019-09921-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10796-019-09921-1,,10.1007/s10796-019-09921-1,2942942407,,0,003-022-686-079-899; 004-345-310-789-588; 005-678-500-548-787; 005-796-039-321-468; 006-558-608-005-442; 007-804-632-977-10X; 013-679-697-508-627; 014-461-421-539-363; 014-909-545-302-926; 015-041-524-925-027; 015-218-998-128-071; 018-345-855-897-35X; 019-385-196-565-281; 019-617-094-191-522; 020-423-916-366-775; 020-651-729-317-681; 021-741-156-825-990; 024-601-766-545-886; 024-863-314-645-595; 026-895-802-475-205; 028-922-696-189-478; 030-104-527-656-466; 030-314-174-466-581; 030-894-861-122-266; 031-293-783-222-28X; 034-442-957-662-943; 034-610-399-035-493; 043-024-581-749-788; 045-732-333-571-271; 050-056-756-492-428; 050-775-143-584-232; 050-860-336-524-54X; 051-038-112-216-29X; 052-121-237-562-341; 057-362-012-774-107; 057-981-589-705-723; 059-198-406-242-083; 060-210-028-318-574; 061-106-551-419-704; 063-999-037-292-53X; 064-847-525-020-457; 067-945-789-277-668; 068-449-861-799-326; 071-387-505-557-483; 072-144-569-097-965; 072-835-920-895-175; 073-123-784-675-864; 082-193-643-919-968; 086-285-005-719-092; 088-273-808-364-904; 091-841-640-811-109; 092-699-978-647-571; 097-244-778-994-553; 098-533-945-081-821; 103-283-718-200-405; 104-693-310-977-403; 104-963-683-392-202; 105-179-598-653-786; 111-918-374-133-371; 112-861-543-573-16X; 114-333-407-393-539; 116-059-643-746-15X; 117-376-485-698-53X; 123-744-689-550-151; 124-346-728-819-292; 124-608-872-203-393; 125-795-343-058-314; 130-454-466-144-47X; 130-540-877-159-511; 134-950-813-808-882; 136-481-382-051-219; 137-185-405-417-755; 137-212-418-154-019; 138-383-642-197-075; 140-488-596-514-465; 145-614-119-612-544; 148-147-612-350-364; 150-145-703-941-867; 150-311-659-083-789; 152-317-375-052-868; 153-062-580-291-31X; 158-785-343-262-786; 159-117-779-555-822; 163-637-734-144-951; 176-241-134-682-896; 185-492-912-762-888; 186-041-334-475-521; 190-388-862-099-07X; 199-591-752-874-216,84,true,cc-by,hybrid

Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis yielded nine factors: gas/crude oil (21.3±5.5%), isoprene emission (17.0±7.1%), Si-rich (14.6±1.3%), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) (11.2±4.0%), traffic (10.6±0.4%), Fluidized-bed Catalytic Cracking (FCC)/high temperature operations (7.2±4.3%), oil refinery (6.8±0.9%), soil and road dust (6.2±0.6%), and petrochemical industries (5.0±5.0%). Daytime and nighttime PMF runs were carried out to see potential differences among and within emission sources. Notable findings include: (1) Nocturnal isoprene emission was identified from traffic exhaust and industrial sources. (2) LPG emissions were higher during the day most likely due to temperature dependent evaporative processes. (3) V/Ni and SO2/V ratios reveal greater contribution from crude oil in the merged natural gas/crude oil emission factor. Corrosion might be responsible for emitting metals (i.e., Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni) from oil refineries during nighttime. (4) In the soil and road dust factor, metals relevant to plant physiological processes are mostly retained by the plants while the lanthanoids and other metals (i.e. Y, Pb, Mn, Ga, Ba) are more prone to physical removal during the day. (5) FCC/high temperature operations are dominated by metals at night. (6) The traffic factor increases during the day possibly due to the higher number of vehicles. Bivariate polar plots suggest the Houston Ship Channel area as the primary emission source for LPG, natural gas/crude oil, FCC/high temperature operations, and petrochemical industries.",6,,100127,,Environmental chemistry; Petrochemical; Liquefied petroleum gas; Oil refinery; Isoprene; Fluid catalytic cracking; Environmental science; Carbon monoxide; Sulfur; Natural gas,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666765721000983,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envadv.2021.100127,,10.1016/j.envadv.2021.100127,3207105034,,0,000-198-604-899-456; 000-254-627-172-157; 000-563-942-718-69X; 000-631-771-768-52X; 001-148-265-337-31X; 002-457-758-209-83X; 002-638-826-169-300; 004-817-369-403-136; 005-328-191-062-66X; 006-561-664-092-314; 006-818-449-404-056; 009-522-467-884-889; 010-459-517-729-454; 012-390-519-137-671; 012-915-706-239-269; 013-153-145-652-464; 014-043-503-212-071; 014-272-997-523-521; 015-021-448-713-197; 015-781-584-224-541; 016-376-269-082-253; 016-670-454-184-814; 016-774-603-185-244; 016-875-284-382-605; 017-047-812-413-659; 017-058-565-632-275; 019-531-196-976-040; 019-693-608-184-210; 020-726-713-242-535; 021-507-426-351-09X; 022-763-744-578-571; 023-229-001-860-88X; 025-177-298-126-950; 025-872-445-030-997; 026-652-179-611-108; 026-927-079-034-307; 027-993-161-624-375; 028-223-928-544-393; 028-907-242-920-902; 029-066-428-528-549; 029-790-399-780-637; 032-000-890-218-969; 034-594-317-153-57X; 037-653-188-696-979; 039-124-407-305-472; 039-198-521-781-773; 040-710-715-289-619; 042-037-420-810-329; 043-445-392-353-165; 046-647-541-642-29X; 047-926-662-526-007; 048-763-655-933-221; 050-049-955-671-722; 050-583-585-399-732; 050-648-011-093-317; 051-091-376-593-980; 051-359-197-179-025; 052-166-853-980-538; 053-880-596-724-203; 057-126-416-482-755; 058-596-549-788-048; 058-996-322-710-433; 060-418-954-285-495; 061-236-051-378-315; 063-652-896-647-922; 063-935-936-727-303; 064-121-984-200-315; 065-276-291-337-629; 065-290-133-313-657; 065-666-287-437-719; 066-857-551-595-205; 067-567-842-040-833; 068-689-254-706-629; 069-390-512-925-606; 069-469-879-445-360; 070-466-485-995-978; 072-471-802-649-93X; 073-154-462-959-137; 073-390-756-856-189; 074-305-464-253-367; 075-312-212-076-941; 076-528-303-676-773; 077-042-073-279-153; 078-516-133-166-205; 078-907-315-255-055; 080-925-643-190-175; 081-236-591-562-813; 083-388-636-146-721; 088-147-917-894-181; 092-045-710-689-399; 096-562-731-547-227; 097-262-556-279-721; 099-921-303-292-222; 101-927-920-247-838; 102-030-154-850-776; 104-026-009-503-170; 105-547-058-044-214; 108-927-761-883-865; 110-511-716-268-823; 110-715-764-748-658; 113-084-060-361-421; 115-335-526-716-439; 117-387-829-219-592; 119-177-430-858-293; 120-151-785-099-484; 122-300-449-215-73X; 122-483-940-203-813; 123-751-398-087-270; 124-300-199-549-683; 124-886-495-064-198; 125-525-591-387-993; 125-681-618-626-320; 125-969-663-610-486; 130-000-640-085-895; 131-336-420-228-28X; 135-728-017-546-93X; 141-508-086-528-13X; 141-718-502-766-010; 142-478-110-001-621; 145-856-491-014-294; 146-232-911-754-610; 147-269-616-438-653; 157-411-722-555-228; 159-323-465-729-655; 173-089-728-349-609; 175-786-978-122-438; 182-477-940-631-792; 184-686-236-716-083,2,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

The theme of Industry 4.0 is ""Smart Manufacturing for the Future"". Now, some futurists even discuss what the fifth industrial revolution’s theme will be. There are a few visions for Industry 5.0. One emerging theme is human-robot co-working. In recent years, we have seen significant advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) research. Today, there are robots for various purposes at affordable prices in the market. It is not long before we closely interact with robots in our lives and workplaces. Testing autonomous cars in traffic is a promising example of this upcoming trend. There are companies having an employee record for robots or AI applications. While there are many studies on human-robot collaboration for low-level tasks with a focus on robot development, we lack studies focusing on organizational issues emerging from human-robot co-working. In this study, we discuss the possible issues related to human-robot co-working from the organizational and human employee’s perspective.

It was predicted that the society is not ready to face this era if they analyse moral cases occur in West Java. Most people who adhere to this religion of Islam, have not been able to fully realize the Islamic values​ in daily life. Ideally, education as a mediator in dealing with these cases presents a solution. Therefore, this article was to provide a basic inspiration regarding the innovation of the Islamic education curriculum based on the values ​​of Sundanese cultural characters. This research uses library research’s method by using inductive-deductive analysis as well as a comparison of literature and content analysis techniques. The result showed that the presence of an Islamic education curriculum based on cultural Sundanese character values ​​could emerge a generation that upholds culture and Islam.

To maintain production and adjust quickly to technological transformation, innovative work-based learning approaches are emphasized. Intelligent machines are becoming capable of interaction and collaboration with humans. They not only introduce a new type of learnable workforce to manufacturing but may open opportunities to enhance learning of all learners. Symbiotic relationships of humans and machines have wide potential for human-centric manufacturing (aka Industry 5.0). Moreover, connecting smart devices and deploying self-learning solutions is envisioned to increase flexibility of manufacturing, thus changing work division between humans and machines. Where humans and machines collaborate, the term Reciprocal Learning has been coined to describe the process of bidirectional learning. While a definition of Reciprocal Learning exists the boundary conditions of the concept are still ambiguous. In this paper, a framework for Reciprocal Learning in Human-Machine Collaboration for Industry 5.0 is presented to clarify what it is and what it isn’t.

Melnyk,"<jats:p>The relevance of the work explains the need to promote advanced scientific knowledge in the context of accelerating scientific and technological progress. The purpose of the article is to reveal the main content of disruptive technologies and related socio-economic processes that occur during the three industrial revolutions. Based on a retrospective analysis of socio-economic revolutions in human history, the popular scientific essay explains the logic and development of technical and social systems. The article shows how the change of production forces and economic relations influences the ratio of individual components in the essential triad of man: bio-socio-labor. The content of the three industrial revolutions that humanity experiences today is revealed separately (Industry 3.0, Industry 4.0, Industry 5.0). It is explained that the works that launched these revolutions took place in the European countries. In particular, the Third Industrial Revolution is aimed at solving the problems of the global environmental crisis. The key transformation tools are alternative energy, additive technologies based on 3D printers, horizontal network structures of production and consumption. The main direction of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is the creation of a unified network of cyber-physical systems capable of working without humans. One of its leading forms is the Internet of Things. The humanization of socio-economic development is a key objective of the Fifth Industrial Revolution, which is focused on achieving the maximum realization of the creative potential of the human-social basis. The focus is on the key processes of the three industrial revolutions and the changes that take place in the essential triad of man.

A unified functional structure of simulators, information, mathematics, and software was created, which is a flexible customizable environment for this class of objects. Based on the information and mathematical support, training scenarios are developed in which different situations and disturbances are modeled by changing the model coefficients and varying the values of variables in the ranges of change. To develop interfaces as close as possible to real objects in a limited time frame, a SCADA HMI was used. The methodology for the development of computer simulators has been tested on the example of electrochemical and electrothermal production of aluminum, calcium carbide, and phosphorus. The efficiency of computer simulators is confirmed by the results of approbation for Russian industrial enterprises, scientific and educational organizations.KeywordsComputer simulatorsTraining of control industry personnelResource-saving controlElectrotechnological installations",,,351,363,SCADA; Computer science; Control (management); Frame (networking); Resource (disambiguation); Variety (cybernetics); Software; Engineering management; Systems engineering,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-95112-2_29,,10.1007/978-3-030-95112-2_29,,,0,027-280-162-203-492; 031-281-368-816-007; 043-980-799-658-395; 044-246-416-116-637; 050-769-230-822-744; 060-856-729-459-030; 079-769-377-141-495; 080-783-743-190-534; 081-467-326-259-635; 113-396-349-085-707; 133-254-395-322-250; 153-486-709-322-180; 175-090-625-676-085,0,false,,

Current human Competences-Capacities that are supported by the technological enablers could result in a radically disempowered human factor. This means that in the processes of optimization and improvement of manufacturing systems from industry 4.0 to industry 5.0, it would be necessary to establish strategies for the empowerment of the human factor, which constitute symbiotic and co-evolutionary socio-technical systems through talent, sustainability, and innovation.

Regular instances of fraudulent acts reveal a lack of openness in agriculture supply chains, raising worries about financial losses, eroding customer trust, and lowering corporate brand value. To develop an efficient and reliable trading environment, several fundamental modifications in the present supply chain architecture are required. There is broad consensus that blockchain can improve transparency in agriculture-food supply chains (agri-food SCs). Consumers now demand safe, sustainable, and equitable food production processes, and businesses are using blockchains and the internet of things to meet these needs. For enhanced responsiveness in agri-food SCs, new concepts have evolved that combine blockchains with various Industry 5.0 technologies (e.g., blockchain technology, big data, internet of things (IoT), radio frequency identification (RFID), near field communication (NFC), etc.). It is critical to cut through the hype and examine the technology’s limits, which might stymie its acceptance, implementation, and scalability in agri-food supply chains. This study presents Agri-SCM-BIoT (Agriculture Supply Chain Management using Blockchain and Internet of things) architecture to address the storage and scalability optimization, interoperability, security and privacy issues security, and privacy of personal data along with storage concerns with present single-chain agriculture supply chain systems. We also discussed the classification of security threats with IoT infrastructure and possible available blockchain-based defense mechanisms.

Such transformations are intrinsic to human and sustainable value creation. An increasing number of companies, recognising this imminent trend, will need to transform their current classical, solely profit-oriented business models into sustainable business models that also target human, social, and environmental aspects. Various frameworks already exist that support the design of sustainable business models. Practical applications of these frameworks and research on the transformation process in the production domain, which places a special focus on small and medium enterprises, is still scarce. This paper presents the first results from a sustainable business model transformation project on a European SME, which produces 3D printers. The research method applies a single case study design.

The area of AI is an interdisciplinary field, which has been designated as a strategic area in the European Union (EU) approach and a key driver of economic development that can bring solutions to many social challenges and problems. Due to its nature and its tendency to be digitally advanced and smarter with analytics, the financial sector is one of the early adopters of AI and expects multiple benefits from its application, that is, the ability to provide better service in the shortest time possible and at a lower cost. AI in the financial sector is based on an understanding of the business needs of financial organizations, institutions and markets and the ability to connect with technological capabilities. They are powerful tools that completely transform this sector. The basic idea of this paper is to consider where the real value of AI in the financial sector is, i.e. what are the practical aspects and business implications of AI in the financial sector globally. It is common knowledge that evolving technologies have always had a strong impact on the sectors in which they are applied because they give them the opportunity to improve existing manufacturing processes, services, customer experiences, operate more efficiently, achieve cost savings, etc. The aim of this paper is to identify areas of application of AI in the financial sector, and to explore leading AI applications that are changing the financial ecosystem, transforming the financial sector and that have the potential to significantly improve many of its functions. The paper further highlights other implications of AI implementation in the financial sector such as employment - job creation and termination of existing AI-influenced employment, the scope and potential of application in developing countries, the problem of regulation and use in the best interests of man, and the importance of properly managing specific AI risks.",8,19,67,81,Finance; Human intelligence; Early adopter; Business; Artificial intelligence; Applications of artificial intelligence; Order (exchange); Common knowledge; European union; Service (economics); Analytics,,,,,https://www.bibliotekabijeljina.rs.ba/index.php/zrefis/article/view/6482 https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=828906 https://doisrpska.nub.rs/index.php/zrefis/article/download/6482/6351 https://doisrpska.nub.rs/index.php/zrefis/article/view/6482 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/287192453.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.7251/zrefis1919067g,,10.7251/zrefis1919067g,3006290725,,0,,3,true,,gold

In this context, the relationship between the digital world and Sustainability is pivotal. This aim of this paper is to discuss, in a reasoned manner, the importance of literacy in the promotion of sustainability in a digital society. For this purpose, the results of a literature review will be mobilized, as well as our 20 years of experience in teaching and research in the fields of sociology, education and organizations, without forgetting the publications that we have on similar topics, which will be, whenever heuristically relevant, mobilized to substantiate and justify the arguments presented herein. The conclusions show that, in a reality where the digital involves many of the life dimensions—for example, in the form of Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0—the role of literacy and, in particular, digital literacy, are critical in the development of sustainability literacy. For this to be possible, significant training work must be carried out. Furthermore, it is not possible to assume that the access, the skills in its use and the benefits of this wonderful digital world will automatically be grasped and felt by all citizens, in an ideology that must be fought. Only in this way will it be possible to foster sustainability, which must necessarily be inclusive.",2,1,1,,Sociology; Ideology; Digital literacy; Context (language use); Public relations; Literacy; Sustainability; Promotion (rank); Forgetting; Politics,,,,,http://www.scholink.org/ojs/index.php/jetss/article/download/2551/2629 http://www.scholink.org/ojs/index.php/jetss/article/view/2551/2629 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/287183766.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.22158/jetss.v2n1p1,,10.22158/jetss.v2n1p1,3000155310,,0,008-555-659-626-264; 021-321-686-802-330; 029-562-142-424-077; 036-297-026-204-017; 081-683-836-428-765,3,true,cc-by,gold

Whittow; Andrew A. West,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a cost-effective method to support the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and is an enabling technology for Industry 5.0. The use of RFID is particularly suited to IIoT as it does not require a line of sight for communication and can be retroactively affixed to non-smart items. However, RFID communication is affected by the properties of the material the tag is affixed to, specifically the material permittivity. Metal is commonly present in smart factory environments and supply chains and impedes RFID communication. A suitable tag design is required to accommodate these challenges and ensure resilience for Industry 5.0 applications. The research presented in this paper has assessed the communication performance of RFID antenna designs with and without metal present beneath the tag. The RFID tag designs that performed reliably in the simulation were manufactured, and their read range was tested on materials of varying relative permittivity and thickness to represent MP and NMP scenarios. The results have verified the robustness of “Cyber” to “Physical” designs and provide recommendations to support practitioner IIoT tag selection.; </jats:p>",121,5-6,3903,3917,Robustness (evolution); Internet of Things; Radio-frequency identification; Supply chain; Computer science; Factory (object-oriented programming); Industry 4.0; Engineering; Embedded system,,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00170-022-09576-4,,10.1007/s00170-022-09576-4,,,0,003-574-818-017-848; 005-858-971-252-825; 006-000-717-661-614; 010-874-227-337-696; 012-635-762-249-975; 029-051-152-251-523; 045-484-156-276-449; 051-686-204-823-295; 064-119-255-100-928; 066-032-702-868-316; 068-605-798-715-071; 072-084-219-287-388; 094-912-338-403-993; 096-181-264-208-496; 098-271-432-456-619; 105-591-186-231-514; 108-189-183-258-272; 112-596-097-344-02X; 112-717-076-088-678; 121-891-824-749-09X; 131-133-972-142-521; 152-707-246-845-89X; 163-830-088-771-081; 167-525-067-938-633,1,true,,hybrid

Automation of manufacturing, collaborative robots (cobots), interconnection of cyber physical systems (CPS), cloud computing, big data analytics and Augmented/Virtual reality (AR/VR) are some of the technologies that are being introduced in industry. Human operators are required to adapt and integrate into those new environments. Human operators should be flexible in their work-tasks, upgrade their skillset and be able to act as a safeguard entity in this complex and dynamic environment. A recent shift in paradigms, the Industry 5.0 concept, focus on the sustainability of the human factor inside the technologies that I4.0 framework introduced, and relates to the ageing workforce issue and the change in individuals’ capabilities. Productivity and safety of the ageing operators in the new workplace environment is causally related to their capabilities. In this research paper, we (i) study the interactions of human operator inside the “smart” workplace and (ii) develop a model using the entropy concept of statistical mechanics. This model can be utilized in the evaluation of human factor inside the complex environment by computing the probability of error based on human operator capabilities.",,,503,510,Automation; Cyber-physical system; Virtual reality; Systems engineering; Productivity; Scope (project management); Computer science; Big data; Cloud computing; Robot,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-74608-7_62,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-74608-7_62,,10.1007/978-3-030-74608-7_62,3162038102,,0,015-950-312-222-432; 020-325-507-157-674; 020-754-413-377-41X; 031-407-243-875-303; 045-489-877-484-021; 049-125-945-524-784; 049-618-632-269-490; 065-145-235-515-830; 067-391-600-417-638; 081-135-492-536-094; 085-470-724-382-404; 095-555-107-736-997; 115-694-819-883-729; 123-691-318-364-898,2,false,,

Concretely, the milestone set for Industry 4.0 was to improve the sustainability and efficiency of production systems. By extension, the emphasis was focused on both the digitization and the digitalization of systems, providing room for further improvement. However, the current technological evolution is more system/machine-oriented, rather than human-oriented. Thus, several countries have begun orchestrating initiatives towards the design and development of the human-centric aspect of technologies, systems, and services, which has been coined as Industry 5.0. The impact of Industry 5.0 will extend to societal transformation, which eventually leads to the generation of a new society, the Society 5.0. The developments will be focused on the social and human-centric aspect of the tools and technologies introduced under the framework of Industry 4.0. Therefore, sustainability and human well-being will be at the heart of what comes next, the Industry 5.0, as a subset of Society 5.0. Industry 5.0 will build on the foundations laid during Industry 4.0 by emphasizing human-centered, resilient, and sustainable design. Consequently, the authors in this research work, through a critical literature review, aim to provide adequate reasoning for considering Industry 5.0 as a framework for enabling the coexistence of industry and emerging societal trends and needs. The contribution of this research work extends to the provision of a framework to facilitate the transition from Industry 4.0 to Society 5.0.</jats:p>",15,17,6276,6276,Industry 4.0; Milestone; Sustainability; Scope (computer science); Digitization; Emerging technologies; Work (physics); Engineering management; Engineering; Business; Management science,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15176276,,10.3390/en15176276,,,0,002-052-422-936-00X; 003-775-201-739-825; 004-970-916-760-02X; 006-420-918-875-724; 015-008-734-610-504; 016-245-823-947-788; 017-415-713-662-955; 020-916-140-650-888; 023-194-785-449-767; 027-194-470-119-742; 033-543-419-909-757; 046-446-925-840-307; 048-092-008-205-493; 048-840-098-633-459; 049-427-149-993-807; 056-892-778-681-803; 059-551-873-028-937; 062-757-415-379-846; 064-138-810-036-202; 064-330-779-044-975; 071-833-629-169-199; 072-397-415-406-687; 075-131-799-552-130; 077-112-920-752-951; 077-683-363-174-659; 081-144-427-432-971; 082-625-361-618-696; 094-374-698-201-994; 098-052-891-518-284; 099-373-385-765-024; 101-535-958-642-486; 102-165-762-216-574; 105-213-855-144-242; 112-781-611-772-743; 130-075-848-983-316; 130-076-441-971-473; 166-587-691-293-979; 166-708-559-622-171; 170-331-599-622-229; 170-563-722-411-658; 172-499-196-865-981; 179-742-231-200-830; 185-018-664-654-715,0,true,cc-by,gold

Singh; Amit Sharma; Deependra Rastogi,"The fourth industrial revolution carries with it various expectations for the future of sustainable and effective development. Industry 4.0 takes a significant part of everyday life. There is no way. The application of digital life on smart phones, touch screens and smart classrooms may be significant indicators of this. Not just computer information and life but also human-like robotics would take a long time. In the immediate future, you will also see the picture of a modern 5.0 model for manufacturing. Since of emerging technology and increasingly evolving and increasing AI-based approaches, remaining on the top is getting more and more challenging. Robots are much more relevant as now the brain-machine’s technology can be merged with the human mind, as artificial intelligence advances. There are coercive problems in the world economy because efficiency is to be improved without the human workforce being robbed of the manufacturing sector. This paper presents the idea of sustainable business 5.0, where machines are intertwined with the human brain and function as partners rather than rivals, against these obstacles. In addition, the effect of Industry 5.0, which is more likely to create more jobs than to reduce, will be discussed on manufacturing and the economy as a whole. The paper describes modern technology, from IoT to news. Thanks to our view, the integration of these innovations would turn industry 4.0 into industry 5.0.",,,,,Industry 4.0; Workforce; Industrial Revolution; Manufacturing; Computer science; Digital Revolution; Sustainability; Everyday life; Robot; Robotics; Artificial intelligence; Business; Industrial organization,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/smart52563.2021.9676275,,10.1109/smart52563.2021.9676275,,,0,,0,false,,

We consider this a significant research gap and explore the relationship between smart contracts and sustainability in supply chains. First, we define the concept of smart contracts in terms of supply chain management. Then, we conduct a content analysis of the literature to explore the overlapping research fields of smart contracts and sustainability in supply chains. Next, we develop a semi-structured assessment framework to model the potential environmental and social impacts induced by smart contracts on supply chains. We propose a conceptual framework for supply chain maturity by mapping the relationships between organizational development, sustainability, and technology. We identify smart contracts as a foundational technology that enables efficient and transparent governance and collaborative self-coordination of human and non-human actors. Thus, we argue that smart contracts can contribute to the economic and social development of networked value chains and Society 5.0. To stimulate interdisciplinary research on smart contracts, we conclude the article by formulating research propositions and trade-offs for smart contracts in the context of technology development, business process and supply chain management, and sustainability.",4,,506436,,Supply chain; Organization development; Conceptual framework; Business; Process management; Smart contract; Context (language use); Supply chain management; Sustainability; Business process,,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2021.506436/full http://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2021.506436/full https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/fbloc/fbloc4.html#GroschopfDH21 https://epub.wu.ac.at/8089/ https://doi.org/10.3389/fbloc.2021.506436,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fbloc.2021.506436,,10.3389/fbloc.2021.506436,3154926564,,0,002-760-373-854-303; 004-416-052-037-484; 005-133-122-211-465; 005-149-068-773-171; 005-442-185-401-994; 008-092-872-335-265; 008-278-305-068-012; 009-066-963-038-036; 012-080-295-344-570; 012-750-062-281-425; 013-784-702-186-55X; 013-923-582-078-155; 014-467-672-077-711; 015-324-282-998-230; 015-531-837-288-016; 018-322-889-591-998; 020-130-108-213-00X; 020-397-213-967-527; 021-183-279-286-700; 021-865-565-414-206; 022-304-790-542-067; 024-848-070-339-296; 025-259-885-861-617; 025-778-999-543-267; 026-189-051-696-665; 026-530-804-160-408; 026-628-464-174-197; 026-983-926-488-462; 027-376-885-405-705; 027-869-443-721-335; 030-979-756-376-267; 032-252-070-420-089; 034-286-418-079-36X; 034-412-215-223-24X; 035-746-214-747-064; 036-127-841-632-948; 036-297-026-204-017; 036-652-321-315-178; 037-326-134-917-66X; 039-075-844-619-412; 039-100-266-277-415; 040-043-730-858-780; 041-327-680-949-713; 041-547-266-590-906; 043-155-133-045-314; 044-259-394-287-963; 044-358-512-277-568; 044-585-731-859-189; 044-991-791-983-038; 046-493-695-827-095; 046-802-872-817-901; 049-915-511-575-054; 050-519-023-029-16X; 052-319-259-195-574; 053-260-479-123-700; 053-271-982-274-008; 053-876-046-265-645; 054-077-508-984-835; 054-079-583-763-10X; 054-572-620-974-512; 055-561-946-689-781; 056-755-206-438-17X; 057-942-097-777-139; 062-586-840-502-936; 063-261-496-298-024; 063-437-003-755-191; 063-639-974-825-135; 064-407-541-887-06X; 065-363-646-942-525; 067-115-161-548-060; 067-170-827-399-658; 067-616-890-979-704; 067-774-235-441-514; 069-996-548-469-303; 070-283-742-732-350; 073-531-395-452-205; 074-389-603-385-644; 077-657-517-956-786; 079-928-195-279-966; 085-202-656-022-106; 086-978-455-549-184; 089-107-756-127-167; 090-738-237-848-225; 092-021-938-321-586; 095-928-879-643-060; 097-712-459-825-335; 098-565-104-723-427; 098-591-774-816-71X; 100-033-511-156-987; 100-764-538-512-485; 101-976-491-799-810; 102-885-865-253-365; 104-571-417-535-351; 107-143-108-125-939; 107-729-387-117-533; 109-120-948-156-499; 112-583-169-215-460; 112-938-897-652-028; 113-130-648-142-38X; 113-222-993-713-524; 114-520-598-829-051; 118-180-500-560-806; 122-949-595-576-636; 122-988-702-721-176; 126-734-247-521-134; 130-078-861-337-742; 133-266-480-630-344; 151-110-591-724-29X; 157-522-909-138-24X; 158-104-490-181-904; 158-408-591-447-532; 170-563-722-411-658; 178-643-297-115-591; 179-546-740-291-787,5,true,cc-by,gold

Lopes; Tiago M. Fernández-Caramés,"Internet of Things (IoT) can help to pave the way to the circular economy and to a more sustainable world by enabling the digitalization of many operations and processes, such as water distribution, preventive maintenance, or smart manufacturing. Paradoxically, IoT technologies and paradigms such as edge computing, although they have a huge potential for the digital transition towards sustainability, they are not yet contributing to the sustainable development of the IoT sector itself. In fact, such a sector has a significant carbon footprint due to the use of scarce raw materials and its energy consumption in manufacturing, operating, and recycling processes. To tackle these issues, the Green IoT (G-IoT) paradigm has emerged as a research area to reduce such carbon footprint; however, its sustainable vision collides directly with the advent of Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI), which imposes the consumption of additional energy. This article deals with this problem by exploring the different aspects that impact the design and development of Edge-AI G-IoT systems. Moreover, it presents a practical Industry 5.0 use case that illustrates the different concepts analyzed throughout the article. Specifically, the proposed scenario consists in an Industry 5.0 smart workshop that looks for improving operator safety and operation tracking. Such an application case makes use of a mist computing architecture composed of AI-enabled IoT nodes. After describing the application case, it is evaluated its energy consumption and it is analyzed the impact on the carbon footprint that it may have on different countries. Overall, this article provides guidelines that will help future developers to face the challenges that will arise when creating the next generation of Edge-AI G-IoT systems.",21,17,5745,,Risk analysis (engineering); Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution; Key (cryptography); Circular economy; Edge computing; Energy consumption; Carbon footprint; Computer science; Sustainable development; Sustainability,AI; Green IoT; IIoT; Industry 5.0; digital circular economy; digital transition; edge AI; edge computing; sustainability,"Artificial Intelligence; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Industry; Internet of Things; Technology",,"Xunta de Galicia (ED431C 2020/15); Agencia Estatal de Investigación of Spain and ERDF funds of the EU (FEDER Galicia 2014-2020 & AEI/FEDER Programs, UE).

067-843-116-643-056,Method of Choice: A Fluorescent Penetrant Taking into Account Sustainability Criteria,2020-07-21,2020,journal article,Sustainability,20711050,MDPI AG,Switzerland,Andrzej Pacana; Dominika Siwiec; Lucia Bednárová,"To conduct, in an effective way, the non-destructive testing (NDT) of products—in particular, the fluorescent penetrant inspection (FPI)—remains a challenge. Therefore, the aim of this work is to propose the method of support in the choice of a fluorescent penetrant to be used in FPI research. In the results of the usage of the proposed procedure, it is demonstrated that it is possible to reduce the negative impacts on the environment by FPI processes (through sustainability), while including other criteria, i.e., financial, security, productive (Industry 4.0), and societal (Society 5.0) criteria. The essence of the proposed method is to integrate two methods of decision support. These were the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method and the cost–quality analysis (AKJ). Using the AHP method, the quality level of fluorescent penetrant (to the satisfaction of the customer)—which included the sustainability criteria—are calculated. These criteria include natural environment, reactivity, combustibility, level of sensitivity, and type of washing (emulsification). Then, with the help of the AKJ, the most favorable penetrant—in terms of quality and cost—is calculated and, thus, indicated. This choice must include the concept of sustainable development. Therefore, this method can be used to choose fluorescent penetrants in manufacturing and service enterprises which carry out FPI.",12,14,5854,,Production engineering; Decision support system; Risk analysis (engineering); Penetrant (mechanical  electrical  or structural); Industry 4.0; Computer science; Sustainable development; Sustainability; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/14/5854 https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/14/5854/pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jsusta/v12y2020i14p5854-d387384.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12145854,,10.3390/su12145854,3044505455,,0,000-695-363-143-021; 001-842-499-591-863; 001-887-301-897-744; 004-642-342-861-629; 006-594-057-855-368; 011-106-244-334-010; 011-724-273-890-292; 012-451-646-595-321; 013-526-888-036-979; 025-204-020-416-209; 027-524-461-508-120; 028-257-664-690-72X; 039-625-408-739-067; 044-973-839-302-205; 045-958-252-943-055; 048-005-247-699-306; 048-367-322-572-662; 050-174-715-361-031; 051-120-994-778-317; 056-726-706-416-396; 060-448-559-184-720; 061-685-589-759-148; 065-618-957-717-028; 070-434-271-190-238; 072-616-966-045-045; 090-240-669-538-468; 091-160-847-313-218; 092-689-613-642-891; 097-634-746-363-654; 099-739-355-853-289; 101-796-787-904-60X; 103-087-756-682-224; 112-550-601-656-329; 114-153-171-038-419; 114-503-012-687-531; 115-376-146-084-776; 116-593-224-234-432; 116-843-377-466-815; 121-003-531-516-657; 124-054-699-293-927; 124-771-719-128-737; 142-455-787-660-889; 150-522-574-730-342; 151-279-079-872-051; 160-330-254-622-824; 162-535-415-660-234; 169-811-077-960-850; 172-888-793-850-904; 177-457-269-965-665; 194-379-240-058-469,16,true,cc-by,gold

Those 4 corporate transformations are characterized by the strategic ambidextrous trilogy toward: a. manufacturing and production; b. design and product engineering; c. innovation and growth; d. support and services. Ultimately both Industry X.0 and Strategic Ambidextrous Trilogy synergize into sustainable transformation to enhance theoretical perspective within industrial and managerial implementation through several benchmarks. Those benchmarks refer to Industry 4.0 (IR 4.0), Making Indonesia 4.0 (MI 4.0), Society 5.0, and Hallyu 2.0.</jats:p>",1115,1,012041,,Engineering management; Engineering; Trilogy; Business engineering,,,,,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MS&E.1115a2041S/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1757-899x/1115/1/012041,,10.1088/1757-899x/1115/1/012041,3145438075,,0,005-688-363-332-013; 012-790-726-411-55X; 017-750-600-412-958; 020-432-626-742-255; 020-759-120-801-486; 023-927-221-065-800; 038-628-003-827-517; 040-034-578-000-100; 040-903-201-933-260; 054-818-565-070-154; 058-579-135-836-252; 091-665-903-115-528; 107-281-290-972-813; 113-623-142-432-051; 117-413-545-021-388; 124-814-014-669-995; 151-066-640-236-837; 164-168-679-748-740; 177-882-177-384-49X; 199-834-633-207-713,0,true,,gold
070-609-833-244-587,From Supply Chain 4.0 to Supply Chain 5.0: Findings from a Systematic Literature Review and Research Directions,2021-07-09,2021,journal article,Logistics,23056290,MDPI AG,,Guilherme F. Frederico,"The main purpose of this paper is to present what the Industry 5.0 phenomenon means in the supply chain context. A systematic literature review method was used to get evidence from the current knowledge linked to this theme. The results have evidenced a strong gap related to Industry 5.0 approaches for the supply chain field. Forty-one (41) publications, including conference and journal papers, have been found in the literature. Nineteen (19) words, which were grouped in four (4) clusters, have been identified in the data analysis. This was the basis to form the four (4) constructs of Industry 5.0: Industry Strategy, Innovation and Technologies, Society and Sustainability, and Transition Issues. Then, an alignment with the supply chain context was proposed, being the basis for the incipient Supply Chain 5.0 framework and its research agenda. Industry 5.0 is still in an embryonic and ideal stage. The literature is scarce and many other concepts and discoveries are going to emerge. Although this literature review is based on few available sources, it provides insightful and novel concepts related to Industry 5.0 in the supply chain context. Moreover, it presents a clear set of constructs and a structured research agenda to encourage researchers in deploying further conceptual and empirical works linked to the subject herein explored. Organizations’ leadership, policymakers, and other practitioners involved in supply chains, and mainly those currently working with Industry 4.0 initiatives, can benefit from this research by having clear guidance regarding the dimensions needed to structurally design and implement an Industry 5.0 strategy. This article adds valuable insights to researchers and practitioners, by approaching the newest and revolutionary concept of the Industry 5.0 phenomenon in the supply chain context, which is still an unexplored theme.",5,3,49,,Supply chain; Business; Set (psychology); Systematic review; Theme (narrative); Industry 4.0; Context (language use); Phenomenon; Knowledge management; Sustainability,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2305-6290/5/3/49 https://www.mdpi.com/2305-6290/5/3/49/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/logistics5030049,,10.3390/logistics5030049,3181086303,,0,002-052-422-936-00X; 002-995-208-654-267; 003-685-612-570-455; 004-771-471-010-549; 005-575-720-029-549; 009-622-019-067-875; 010-851-355-868-035; 011-025-043-884-126; 011-410-510-810-515; 012-778-342-347-913; 013-414-291-804-06X; 013-666-788-578-273; 013-833-776-008-172; 013-946-940-428-103; 013-965-875-718-449; 014-253-688-185-713; 016-819-194-616-838; 017-039-755-425-775; 017-400-439-409-436; 017-415-713-662-955; 018-736-947-864-860; 025-897-510-825-800; 026-467-059-357-593; 027-194-470-119-742; 027-519-650-344-683; 028-035-696-992-155; 028-232-581-949-707; 029-170-236-791-182; 031-788-368-038-551; 031-827-047-258-990; 033-541-372-628-755; 033-851-018-944-660; 036-040-292-606-795; 037-079-191-125-268; 039-897-047-836-935; 040-252-352-426-753; 040-993-170-582-788; 041-950-002-747-236; 047-913-991-153-149; 049-816-999-056-296; 050-496-617-654-385; 051-996-378-965-713; 055-503-862-911-546; 065-697-272-243-331; 068-881-795-087-007; 069-439-400-219-98X; 071-666-089-865-306; 076-303-271-715-610; 077-492-800-825-463; 084-669-760-021-35X; 085-300-287-100-525; 088-950-699-690-043; 098-319-766-113-317; 111-895-591-146-057; 113-654-439-988-458; 113-830-545-572-413; 115-709-456-822-925; 120-445-101-442-303; 122-479-711-922-142; 123-365-319-409-994; 124-727-841-701-631; 124-816-947-335-101; 125-184-556-716-218; 125-795-343-058-314; 129-227-139-583-699; 135-038-723-068-121; 135-553-141-898-826; 136-779-502-305-386; 138-332-915-687-580; 138-529-852-670-835; 140-109-678-513-738; 157-052-308-598-183; 158-070-665-594-661; 160-578-615-287-646; 170-912-030-345-381; 193-761-582-495-002; 197-865-213-931-245,15,true,cc-by,gold

Zanchettin,"Industry 5.0 has laid the necessity to relocate the human at the center of the manufacturing cycle, where everything should be designed to ease his/her work. This implies one to redefine the human-robot collaboration, making it not only safe, but also more inclusive for the operator. Nowadays, this goal is viable thanks to the integration of new sensors in the work cell. Coupled with advanced control strategies, they give the robot a better understanding of both the surrounding environment and the human movement, allowing a more organic cooperation. This paper exploits an RGBD camera and Deep Learning algorithms to retrieve the 3D positions of the manipulated objects in the workspace and to infer the most likely future human destinations in a pick and place case study. Merging this information, a proper control logic is defined and tested in a real robotics application, with the final intent of minimizing human-robot collisions during the collaboration and making the process more reliable and efficient.",,,,,Workspace; Robotics; Computer science; Artificial intelligence; Robot; Process (computing); Exploit; Human–robot interaction; Human–computer interaction; SMT placement equipment; Artificial neural network,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icar53236.2021.9659328,,10.1109/icar53236.2021.9659328,,,0,,0,false,,

Uncertainty management will be particularly important in Industry 5.0 solutions that will require the close integration of operators and technical systems. To prepare for these challenging developments, this work reviews the sources of uncertainty and the scheduling algorithms that deal with the different types of models developed to handle the uncertain nature of the elements and the environment of complex technological systems. The paper not only identifies the challenges, but also the main building blocks that can help to manage and reduce uncertainties based on the I4.0 and I5.0 solutions. We hope that this study will serve as a starting point for R&#x0026;D projects and algorithm developments, which will be needed primarily in the field of multi-agent, multistage and inverse optimizations.",10,,74977,75017,Computer science;

The renewal of a culture of design and business innovation in the area of fashion and textile design is based on the establishment of bridges with different realities that, increasingly dynamic, change the landscape of different products and their creation processes, blurring the boundaries and limits of each area of intervention and its actors. From the small to the big industry we find new needs and professions that project themselves into the future reaching from the past, as in the case of new craft productions that value the identity, artistic and cultural heritage of each geography, supported by new materials and technologies of Industry 5.0. This new dynamic of integrated work, where everyone contributes to enhance the knowledge of each participant, enabling the renewal of knowledge and the development of innovation and social, cultural, and economic inclusion, needs greater support and connection between academia and the creative and productive reality on the ground. The present research group, sustained by the interpretation of the paths of work innovation in the coming decades, intended to provide a contribution to the industry and the culture of national or international design innovation, through research based on the identification of the knowledge and skills necessary for the future training of fashion designers.The adoption of a qualitative and quantitative methodology should allow the collection of data that can indicate trends of needs of future designers and the need to adapt the academy to these new realities. With this study we intend to establish a network of relationships between the different actors in the process of creation and innovation, as well as promote a greater connection between the different forms of creation and production that allow to satisfy the final consumer and their needs around fashion and textiles.</jats:p>",,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.54941/ahfe1001539,,10.54941/ahfe1001539,,,0,,0,false,,

Through the developmentof ESRI technologies, which allow the integration of WebGIS with Artificial Intelligence, the Internetof Things and aerospace Big Data, the Science of Where is defining new ways of designing and experiencingthe environment and the city. In this initial phase of the Digital Revolution it is essential to affirmthe paradigm of a society, called “Society 5.0”, capable of responding to the challenges of its owntime, balancing economic progress with solutions to social problems. The enabling factor of this paradigmis the Science of Where and the thesis that the Science of Where is the enabling factor of the paradigm thatimplements Society 5.0 is fascinating, but has to be demonstrated. In order to prove this thesis, holistic experimentationis necessary, which involves all the actors present in the theater of society in order to demonstratethe benefits of this philosophy in this field through the exercise of good practices. For this reason,ESRI Italia recently set up a laboratory to conduct experiments at its regional office in Cagliari (Italy). Theexperimentation is scheduled in a project called Sardinia 5.0. The Laboratory is equipped with all the infrastructures,technologies and data necessary for specialists to perform the assessment of the social impact ofexisting initiatives and the construction of scenarios for a possible future.",1,,,,Engineering management; Engineering; Field (geography); Set (psychology); Aerospace; Order (exchange); Digital Revolution; Economic progress; Social issues; Big data,,,,,http://www.j-reading.org/index.php/geography/article/download/198/161 http://www.j-reading.org/index.php/geography/article/view/198,http://www.j-reading.org/index.php/geography/article/view/198,,,2886260157,,0,138-742-055-433-901,3,false,,

The history of planning and social partnership, the courses of nationalisation and privatisation and the problem of damaging the state are discussed as well. The author concludes that the crisis has not resulted in the strengthening of the developmental or welfare role of the state, the evolution of a “developmental welfare state” has become less likely in Ireland in the course of crisis management. Another lesson is that the state can manage certain bad assets of the private sector in a way that yields a profit to the public. There are other costs of the crisis management, however, which are to be paid by the people and result in a decrease of state ownership and a shrinking of the welfare systems.",67,4,557,583,Welfare; Private sector; Welfare state; Business; Profit (economics); Social Partnership; State ownership; Developmental state; Crisis management; Market economy,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/148786051 https://akademiai.com/doi/abs/10.1556/032.2017.67.4.4 https://ideas.repec.org/a/aka/aoecon/v67y2017i4p557-583.html https://socionet.ru/publication.xml?h=repec:aka:aoecon:v:67:y:2017:i:4:p:557-583 https://akjournals.com/view/journals/032/67/4/article-p557.xml http://real.mtak.hu/72479/ https://core.ac.uk/download/148786051.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1556/032.2017.67.4.4,,10.1556/032.2017.67.4.4,2782822411,,0,005-733-844-476-958; 006-122-858-695-039; 010-816-918-491-152; 012-342-546-087-108; 025-901-051-424-563; 034-314-066-005-679; 034-758-786-812-409; 087-264-594-276-923; 095-421-061-786-644; 101-227-538-401-374; 112-665-945-547-839; 112-772-534-311-075; 120-155-222-471-711; 139-525-892-777-774; 150-226-661-473-536; 163-142-698-247-827; 175-687-165-971-80X; 196-523-663-093-422,2,true,,green

Pemanfaatan teknologi informasi menjadi mutlak dilakukan dan dapat menjadi sarana pembuktian secara elektronik serta upaya pencegahan klaim dari negara lain. Kata kunci: genetik; Indonesia; keragaman; informasi; teknologi ABSTRACT Indonesia stores abundant genetik resources but has weaknesses in its database. This becomes a gap in the biopiracy of the pharmaceutical companies in developed countries. The development of information technology entered the era of technology 4.0 and society 5.0. Legal protection of genetik resources in terms of regulation and institutions as well as optimization of information technology in non-juridical protection. The research method used is juridical normative with descriptive analysis approach. Data was collected through literature study and interviews and analyzed using qualitative juridical methods. Indonesia does not yet have specific rules regarding genetik resources. The Convention on Biological Diversity, the Cartagena Protocol and the Nagoya Protocol are not yet optimal because they are not supported by developed countries that apply double standards. The development of information technology is both an opportunity and a challenge. Information technology can be a means of compiling a database of abundant and diverse genetik resources. The use of information technology is absolutely necessary and can be a means of proving electronically and efforts to prevent claims from other countries.

Attempts are made to offer – starting from an upgrade of knowledge and educational paths – a new innovative society (known as Society 5.0 or Super Smart Society) where companies and territorial stakeholders are a part of complex relation systems leading to the creation of new sustainable and intertwined supply chains (territorial networking), also with the support of properly designed tools such as the service platforms. In this scenario, design develops new planning visions based on relational paradigms and represents the bridge between technological innovation and social contexts since it is able to plan technology by harmonizing cultural, social, economical and political elements.",,,703,708,Supply chain; Vision; Business; Process management; Circular economy; Bridge (interpersonal); Service (systems architecture); Plan (drawing); Strategic design; Politics,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-68017-6_104 https://flore.unifi.it/handle/2158/1241873,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-68017-6_104,,10.1007/978-3-030-68017-6_104,3125540001,,0,038-317-334-957-887; 081-299-086-476-760; 092-327-604-136-796; 097-908-934-337-344; 146-185-555-861-882,0,false,,

Within the purview of circular economy, this paper indicates various aspects and implications of data sharing in the SCs in light of the published research. Taking into consideration the heterogeneity of data sources and standards, this article also catalog all the major data-sharing technologies being employed in sharing data digitally across the SCs. Drawing on the published research from 2015 to 2021, following the PRISMA framework, this paper presents the state of research in the field of data sharing in SCs in terms of their standardization, optimization, simulation, automation, security and more notably sustainability. Using the co-occurrence metric, bibliometric analysis has been conducted such that the collected research is categorized under various keyword clusters and regional themes. This article brings together two major themes in reviewing the research in the field. Firstly, the bibliometric analysis of the published articles makes manifest the contours of the current state of research and the future possibilities in the field. Secondly, in synthesizing the research on the foundations of sustainability within the CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework, this article deals with the various aspects and implications of information sharing in the SCs. By bringing these two themes together, this paper affords a prospective researcher with the research vis-à-vis the information sharing in SC, starting from the actual data standards in use to the modality and consequence of their application within the perspective of the circular economy. This article, in essence, indicates how all the aspects of data sharing in SCs may be brought together in service of the theme of I5.0.",5,,100074,100074,Interoperability; Standardization; Information sharing;

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is central to this change and offers major opportunities to improve our lives. The recent developments in AI are the result of increased processing power, improvements in algorithms and the exponential growth in the volume and variety of digital data. Many applications of AI have started entering into our every-day lives, from machine translations, to image recognition, and music generation, and are increasingly deployed in industry, government, and commerce. Connected and autonomous vehicles, and AI-supported medical diagnostics are areas of application that will soon be commonplace. There is strong global competition on AI among the US, China, and Europe. The US leads for now but China is catching up fast and aims to lead by 2030. For the EU, it is not so much a question of winning or losing a race but of finding the way of embracing the opportunities offered by AI in a way that is human-centred, ethical, secure, and true to our core values. The EU Member States and the European Commission are developing coordinated national and European strategies, recognising that only together we can succeed. We can build on our areas of strength including excellent research, leadership in some industrial sectors like automotive and robotics, a solid legal and regulatory framework, and very rich cultural diversity also at regional and sub-regional levels. It is generally recognised that AI can flourish only if supported by a robust computing infrastructure and good quality data: • With respect to computing, we identified a window of opportunity for Europe to invest in the emerging new paradigm of computing distributed towards the edges of the network, in addition to centralised facilities. This will support also the future deployment of 5G and the Internet of Things. • With respect to data, we argue in favour of learning from successful Internet companies, opening access to data and developing interactivity with the users rather than just broadcasting data. In this way, we can develop ecosystems of public administrations, firms, and civil society enriching the data to make it fit for AI applications responding to European needs. We should embrace the opportunities afforded by AI but not uncritically. The black box characteristics of most leading AI techniques make them opaque even to specialists. AI systems are currently limited to narrow and well-defined tasks, and their technologies inherit imperfections from their human creators, such as the well-recognised bias effect present in data. We should challenge the shortcomings of AI and work towards strong evaluation strategies, transparent and reliable systems, and good human-AI interactions. Ethical and secure-by-design algorithms are crucial to build trust in this disruptive technology, but we also need a broader engagement of civil society on the values to be embedded in AI and the directions for future development. This social engagement should be part of the effort to strengthen our resilience at all levels from local, to national and European, across institutions, industry and civil society. Developing local ecosystems of skills, computing, data, and applications can foster the engagement of local communities, respond to their needs, harness local creativity and knowledge, and build a human-centred, diverse, and socially driven AI. We still know very little about how AI will impact the way we think, make decisions, relate to each other, and how it will affect our jobs. This uncertainty can be a source of concern but is also a sign of opportunity. The future is not yet written. We can shape it based on our collective vision of what future we would like to have. But we need to act together and act fast.",,,,,The Internet; Variety (cybernetics); Psychological resilience; Business; Interactivity; Government; Artificial intelligence; Applications of artificial intelligence; Civil society; Social engagement,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:ipt:iptwpa:jrc113826 https://ideas.repec.org/p/ipt/iptwpa/jrc113826.html https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC113826 https://core.ac.uk/download/162257245.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2760/11251,,10.2760/11251,2908425202,,0,,38,true,,green

The new Industry 5.0 has a positive impact on the performance of the logistics. Logistics information system is a root of supply chain to collect the information related to products and track the information and services related to the products in a supply chain manner. A sound logistics information system can lead to cost reduction and can also improve customer satisfaction. However, research on IoT adoption in logistics is acceptance of IoT into supply chain services in specific has been rhetoric. IoT creates far-reaching payoffs for all the operations of logistics among the suppliers and customers. This benefit extends across the entire logistics information system, including inventory, transportation, and delivery system with better efficiency, security, and safety. This chapter is drawn upon the organizational capability theory for developing effects of IoT on logistics management and in turn improves logistics information system as well as organizational performance.",,,19,30,Supply chain; Business; Organizational performance; Information system; Goods and services; Customer satisfaction; Process management; Cost reduction; Distribution (economics); Track (rail transport),,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-77070-9_2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-77070-9_2,,10.1007/978-3-030-77070-9_2,3210262841,,0,004-632-240-890-139; 007-799-021-634-091; 016-586-011-159-140; 025-008-707-109-880; 051-644-665-349-041; 084-205-055-589-075; 097-653-713-917-618; 100-104-605-912-021; 114-040-901-545-754; 151-507-382-689-390; 166-487-315-129-026,0,false,,

F. Moller; Hamid Vakilzadian; Roland E. Haas,"In the past, manufacturing equipment was instrumented hard-wired. Industrial equipment such as sensors, controllers, and others are expensive, and upgrading manufacturing equipment in existing facilities is costly. The growing use of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven cost reductions in sensors, controllers, and communications through high volumes of digital devices and value-added components. The manufacturing sector with its massive installed base of legacy equipment has also become an area of interest for the advances in innovative digital technologies. Meanwhile, the next level of innovation in manufacturing has been achieved, labeled by the term 4th Industrial Revolution, in short Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 takes the automation of manufacturing processes to a new level by introducing customized and intelligent production technologies. Machines are connected and communicate with each other to ultimately make decisions, operate independently, or cooperate with humans in a customer-oriented production environment. This raises the question about the key issues of the next industrial enhancement and the term to call it? The change from Industry 4.0 to the next innovative industrial enhancement is termed Industry 5.0. However, Industry 5.0 has its root in the concept of Industry 4.0. Thus, the key issues of the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 can be seen in the goal of making manufacturability sustainable from economic, ecologic and societal perspectives. This requires building a circular economy with a focus on a human centric industry.

This paper explores how data-driven decision-making (DDDM) can enable sustainable and resilient supply chain operations within the manufacturing industry. A series of in-depth interviews were conducted with experts, researchers, and company representatives across the manufacturing industry and universities in Sweden. The findings show a consensus among companies, researchers, and literature about the potential of data utilization for sustainability purposes; however, in most cases, the complete transformation towards data-driven has not happened yet. Companies have uncertainty about what data is needed rather than its lack. Reliability &amp; validity of data become essential to exploit the potential of the data organizations already possess. Based on the literature and interview data, a conceptual model is proposed, including three identified parameters connected to DDDM, 1) data and IT infrastructure, 2) current operations, and 3) an improved triple bottom line performance. The model captures the interconnections between such parameters, depicting the benefits and challenges of DDDM and its relation to more sustainable and resilient supply chain operations within the manufacturing industry. In a data-driven approach, real-time analysis of complex &amp; extensive amounts of data gives unlimited possibilities to improve manufacturing operations through decision-making.</jats:p>",,,,,Exploit; Supply chain; Sustainability; Digital transformation; Manufacturing; Data-driven; Triple bottom line; Process management; Industry 4.0; Big data; Relation (database); Reliability (semiconductor); Computer science; Business; Engineering,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/atde220158,,10.3233/atde220158,,,0,,0,true,,gold

Huang,"Benefiting from the marriage of just-in-time (JIT) and computer integrated manufacturing (CIM), a series of manufacturing planning and control (MPC) systems has been introduced for contemporary production and operations management. However, the increasing requirements for customized and personalized products and services, together with the acceleration of the socio-economic environment in the age of Industry 4.0, forced manufacturers to re-evaluate their current MPC strategies that mainly emphasize time, cost and quality priorities. Industry 4.0 presents a solid ambition for transforming to a digital, data-driven and interconnected manufacturing industry centred around cyber-physical convergence. Although the relevance of Industry 4.0 technologies’ disruptions on operations management has been acknowledged, a significant gap in the evolution of the logic and design of MPC systems has been observed. The requirements of on-demand products and services with enhanced flexibility, resilience, sustainability and humanitarianism in this new industrial revolution call for innovations of MPC architectures and approaches. This paper first summarizes the evolution of MPC systems with enabling technologies and the changing business climate at that time. To explore innovative MPC that complies with the increasing economic, social and environmental requirements, the concept of synchronization-oriented MPC with four principles is proposed. Following the principles, a general framework for the synchronization-oriented MPC with enhanced economic, social and environmental benefits is developed. This work potentially provides insights into innovative MPC in the age of Industry 4.0 and even Industry 5.0.",55,2,163,168,Flexibility (engineering); Industry 4.0; Synchronization (alternating current); Sustainability; Quality (philosophy); Computer science; Business; Risk analysis (engineering),,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2022.04.187,,10.1016/j.ifacol.2022.04.187,,,0,001-011-892-665-374; 001-103-459-836-919; 001-758-579-687-388; 009-980-090-585-966; 012-218-887-216-344; 013-209-041-019-592; 014-796-353-623-217; 020-627-235-778-998; 036-379-622-440-373; 038-905-048-579-484; 044-826-117-182-379; 045-936-475-493-242; 054-566-657-836-198; 055-185-113-498-458; 057-335-032-266-130; 059-424-427-267-469; 064-138-810-036-202; 082-140-051-993-161; 085-056-385-382-296; 095-366-405-250-466; 102-087-824-667-717; 114-257-960-475-300; 121-189-721-254-131; 126-126-765-625-33X; 129-461-000-946-008,2,true,,gold

Physical activity monitoring digital platforms are architected to improve the healthcare status of patients with diabetes and other lifestyle-related diseases. Furthermore, digital platforms are expected to generate profits for health technology companies and help control costs in the healthcare ecosystem. However, current digital enterprise architecture approaches are not well-established, and the potentials have not yet been realized. Design thinking approach and agile software development methodologies can overcome these limitations, beginning with proof of concept and pilot projects and then scaling to the production environment. In this paper, we describe how that the adaptive integrated digital architecture framework (AIDAF) for Design Thinking approach is proposed and verified in a case of a university hospital in the Americas. In addition, challenges and future activities for this area are discussed that cover the directions for Society 5.0.",,,,,Agile software development; Architecture; Health care; Enterprise architecture; Engineering management; Computer science; Knowledge management; Design thinking; Healthcare industry; Process management; Business,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/edocw52865.2021.00043,,10.1109/edocw52865.2021.00043,,,0,007-848-718-741-047; 008-936-401-996-515; 030-461-029-114-432; 040-888-328-057-154; 043-979-280-803-957; 044-406-763-486-675; 056-714-376-558-19X; 065-988-543-203-56X; 068-697-353-290-622; 076-090-402-933-022; 076-363-782-379-334; 099-347-097-180-014; 105-583-882-171-236; 108-358-496-436-118; 116-689-868-461-805; 128-433-358-622-839; 129-163-283-042-440; 131-319-356-777-545; 131-862-870-984-170; 142-693-927-846-524; 170-563-722-411-658; 199-053-627-593-900,3,false,,

It is actually significant that the global system involves a multidimensional and technology-driven structure and that national-states’ regulations occur along with transnational practices. In this system, new technologies have a big role. New technologies consist of some innovations such as artificial intelligence, robotics, big data, internet of things, cloud technology, and so on, that describe the concept of ‘Society 5.0’ proposed by Japan and the concept of ‘Industry 4.0’ proposed by Germany. These technologies create super smart society in terms of their impacts on improving human life. Smart technologies improve human life in the fields of education, health, security, etc. On the other hand, smart technologies used in the process of production shape the global production network and the innovative strategies of firms. It is required that new technologies should not be remained uncontrolled within the logic of ‘laissez faire’ because their impacts and power are so great. Thus, national-states should make efficient economic policies by also considering transnational practices; like that Japan and Germany develop their own national view in terms of Society 5.0 and Industry 4.0. Such fields come into prominence in the economic policies in respect of new technologies: Competition policy on the basis of global competition and innovativeness—Industrialization policy on the basis of emerging industries of new technologies—Intellectual property policy on the basis of the rights of people and firms producing knowledge and innovation—Employment policy on the basis of new occupations and specialities in the global age—Social policy on the basis of new technologies’ control on individual and social life.",,,139,163,Economic policy; Business; Laissez-faire; Emerging technologies; Control (management); Production (economics); Competition (economics); Process (engineering); Big data; Cloud computing,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-33-6811-8_8 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-33-6811-8_8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-33-6811-8_8,,10.1007/978-981-33-6811-8_8,3160004077,,0,015-666-815-227-966; 017-415-713-662-955; 049-816-999-056-296; 054-052-045-969-194; 162-717-451-214-458; 175-386-977-279-510,0,false,,

These solutions are commonly built on digital twins, i.e., comprehensive, structured and effective digital representations of the production system and its entities, whose current status is constantly updated by the plugged data sources. The arising of the Industry 5.0 paradigm and the established key role of workers in manufacturing require new Digital Twins to represent also humans. In fact, as cognitive automation becomes more and more pervasive and its behaviour unintelligible to humans, it becomes essential for improving performance and well-being, at the same time, to model humans as data-driven agents and to represent their interaction with the factory systems. Currently, a standardised solution for creating Digital Twins is missing, forcing industrial solution architects to resort to ad-hoc implementations and models. These solutions lack re-usability, scalability and extensibility, preventing the introduction of a human digital representation in existent twins, so hindering the complete shift to the new Industry 5.0 paradigm. In this paper, such limitations are faced by introducing an extensible and flexible IIoT-industrial internet of things-based platform with a twofold benefit: on the one hand, to support the creation of customised data representations of production systems and their entities including humans; on the other hand, to provide a modular infrastructure, along with its interchangeable components, for easy digital twin instantiation and ramp-up. An implementation of the platform has been tested with different applications in a laboratory setting and released as a public resource. Finally, potential future applications of the proposed digital twin are discussed, highlighting its main benefits.",107,,661,667,Computer science; Implementation; Modular design; Scalability; Factory (object-oriented programming); Industry 4.0; Context (archaeology); Automation; Usability; USable; Data science; Software engineering; Distributed computing,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2022.05.042,,10.1016/j.procir.2022.05.042,,,0,002-599-460-164-388; 006-824-466-671-376; 009-196-394-593-472; 009-683-959-159-971; 012-302-514-956-35X; 013-007-720-642-102; 015-228-799-602-614; 017-415-713-662-955; 019-768-331-540-502; 028-466-048-018-180; 047-436-453-460-898; 068-775-721-617-07X; 083-138-344-350-817; 085-466-022-073-007; 094-019-771-819-795; 096-017-941-794-37X; 117-587-846-748-601; 127-046-613-305-747; 129-461-404-099-044; 131-206-117-846-231,0,true,,gold

In this study, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) integrated Project Oriented Problem Based Learning (POPBL) learning models were implemented to improve the mastery of science concepts of junior high school students, especially on the topic of Environmental Pollution. The method used was a mixed-method. The STEM integrated STB learning model design framework consists of 3 stages: Onset Stage, Execution Stage, and Closure Stage. The concept of students is emphasized at the onset stage in the case study dissemination phase. In this phase, students analyze problems based on articles provided by the teacher. The more understanding the material, the more critical students will explore existing issues and find logical solutions to those problems. The results showed that there was a difference between the average pretest and posttest learning outcomes (t=-5,660; df = 53; Sig. (2-tailed) = 0,000). This indicates an increase in junior high school students' science concepts mastery after using the STEM integrated POPBL Learning Model. Improving students' mastery of concepts using a STEM integrated POPBL learning model is still in the low category with n-gain = 0.17. Although still in the low category, the POPBL learning model with the STEM approach can be optimized to improve students' mastery of concepts and skills on other science topics.",7,2,120,129,Mathematics education; Closure (psychology); Problem-based learning; Environmental pollution; Design framework; Learning models,,,,,https://journal.trunojoyo.ac.id/penasains/article/download/8260/STEM%20Education https://journal.trunojoyo.ac.id/penasains/article/view/8260 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/348690263.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.21107/jps.v7i2.8260,,10.21107/jps.v7i2.8260,3094860267,,0,,1,true,cc-by,gold

Internet of Things (IoT) has a vital role in the smart city for vaccine manufacturing with wearable sensors. According to the advanced services in intelligent manufacturing, the fourth resolution is also changing in Industry 5.0 and utilizes high-definition connectivity sensors. Traditional manufacturing companies rely on trusted third parties, which may act as a single point of failure. Access control, big data, and scalability are also challenging issues in existing systems because of the demand response data (DRD) in advanced manufacturing. To mitigate these challenges, CoVAC: A P2P Smart Contract-based Intelligent Smart City Architecture for Vaccine Manufacturing is proposed with three layers, including connection, conversion, and intelligent cloud layer. Smart contract-based blockchain is utilized at the conversion layer for resolving access control, security, and privacy issues. Deep learning is adopted in the intelligent cloud layer for big data analysis and increasing production for vaccine manufacturing in smart city environments. A case study is carried out wherein access data are collected from the various smart plants for vaccines using smart manufacturing to validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. Simulation of the proposed architecture is performed on the collected advanced sensor IoT plants data to address the challenges above, offering scalable production in the vaccine manufacturing for the smart city.",166,,107967,107967,Scalability; Big data; Architecture; Cloud computing; Computer science; Smart city; Computer security; Engineering,Access control; Blockchain; Deep learning; Security; Smart city; Vaccine manufacturing,,,National Research Foundation of Korea,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2022.107967,35136280,10.1016/j.cie.2022.107967,,PMC8800559,0,004-022-393-756-784; 011-243-463-652-183; 011-589-657-304-783; 018-620-535-394-60X; 022-509-034-520-128; 023-519-939-455-012; 025-933-995-998-149; 031-946-045-099-713; 038-695-772-780-266; 048-420-146-007-671; 050-723-621-039-884; 052-096-758-892-758; 052-931-135-307-897; 061-991-900-106-701; 062-834-706-462-611; 068-248-869-610-451; 085-314-492-915-19X; 092-187-469-730-992; 107-032-448-808-953; 107-742-679-898-876; 113-530-773-106-540; 137-161-269-053-072; 155-778-282-455-140; 176-740-600-107-941,1,true,,green

With the availability of low cost, open-source microcontrollers/microcomputers, such as the Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms, and a wide variety of sensors and communication tools, a range of engineering applications and innovations may be developed at a low price. Furthermore, the cost of solar panels and LED lamps have also dropped dramatically in recent years and these also allow for improved energy support in regions that lack energy access or require autonomous monitoring/processing. Also, low-cost 3D printers are now widely available for making simple prototypes of hardware. Finally, low-cost educational software tools have also become available. Combining these technologies enables engineering education to be brought into traditionally inaccessible communities in the world. In this book chapter, examples of how ICT and energy technologies are being used to teach students engineering technologies in underserved communities will be described. Application areas to be described will include environmental monitoring, clean water systems, and remote learning.</jats:p>",,,,,Variety (cybernetics); Information and Communications Technology; Arduino; Microcontroller; Engineering; Computer science; Software; Systems engineering; Multimedia; Engineering management; Telecommunications; Embedded system,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.100097,,10.5772/intechopen.100097,,,0,003-302-172-383-013; 006-653-870-575-42X; 027-032-114-842-334; 031-542-800-532-293; 033-599-711-469-966; 063-320-047-666-423; 065-028-178-132-493; 077-938-861-455-893; 125-487-352-929-471; 154-630-130-494-178,0,true,,hybrid

Interfaces to digital twins are projected to go beyond physical representations to become blueprints for the actual “objects” and an active dashboard for their control. The role and importance of real-time interactive animations presented in an Extended Reality (XR) format will be explored. The need for using game engines, particularly their physics engines and AI within interactive simulated Extended Reality is expanded on. Importing and scanning real-world environments is assumed to become more efficient when using AR. Exporting to VR and AR is recommended to be a default feature. A technology framework for the next generation simulators is presented along with a proposed set of implementation guidelines. The need for more human centric technology approaches, nascent in Industry 4.0, are now central to the emerging Industry 5.0 paradigm; an agenda that is discussed in this research as part of a human in the loop future, supported by DES. The potential role of Explainable Artificial Intelligence is also explored along with an audit trail approach to provide a justification of complex and automated decision-making systems with relation to DES. A technology framework is proposed, which brings the above together and can serve as a guide for the next generation of holistic simulators for manufacturing.",28,,100354,100354,Blueprint; Computer science; Dashboard; Set (abstract data type); Systems engineering; Relation (database); Engineering management; Human–computer interaction; Engineering,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jii.2022.100354,,10.1016/j.jii.2022.100354,,,0,001-355-528-644-349; 002-204-351-572-64X; 003-179-703-682-143; 003-659-709-722-399; 005-560-846-503-793; 007-943-326-313-110; 008-124-206-643-913; 012-958-772-200-290; 014-188-774-602-95X; 014-356-639-091-333; 015-645-845-323-673; 017-415-713-662-955; 018-822-581-363-834; 021-194-441-266-323; 022-367-904-225-827; 025-153-441-501-113; 026-672-252-143-717; 027-519-173-335-863; 029-914-656-724-778; 031-246-319-001-086; 032-616-715-302-958; 033-070-177-433-014; 035-546-565-325-481; 044-089-862-763-686; 045-936-475-493-242; 048-849-788-613-544; 049-169-246-735-763; 049-289-406-254-077; 050-053-538-015-777; 054-019-477-630-579; 056-985-530-044-66X; 057-874-620-604-119; 058-402-060-554-395; 064-042-765-914-689; 071-718-327-513-958; 071-860-959-402-137; 082-165-078-995-643; 083-197-057-555-879; 085-912-259-715-810; 087-103-284-480-892; 087-323-490-534-091; 087-463-934-148-429; 093-391-963-949-855; 100-305-576-140-00X; 102-188-784-863-096; 103-240-324-065-730; 104-963-683-392-202; 104-970-888-250-123; 113-830-545-572-413; 130-076-441-971-473; 137-010-626-416-647; 139-606-728-531-216,0,true,,hybrid

Such systems could lead to a different manufacturing process closer to the current market needs. In addition, the factories can be more efficient, sustainable, and environmentally friendly. This work intends to explore a different approach to the manufacturing process, where there is no production planned behind and the shop floor is a provider of services for the products to be built. For that purpose, this paper proposes an executable model defining the interaction between the different actors and representing the digital counterpart of the CPS. We use a high-level graphical language to create the executable model that allows easy and flexible experimentation with different scenarios. Also, the model can be made as detailed as needed while providing a precise and readable simulation and a resulting detailed log amenable to further analysis.",,,,,Executable; Computer science; Industry 4.0; Cloud computing; Cyber-physical system; Context (archaeology); Process (computing); Production (economics); Software engineering; The Internet; Work (physics); Manufacturing engineering; Systems engineering,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/isie51582.2022.9831527,,10.1109/isie51582.2022.9831527,,,0,002-974-268-721-211; 023-363-806-263-238; 026-493-017-081-372; 029-967-429-669-712; 030-950-739-222-179; 043-392-211-374-500; 062-704-150-216-355; 071-457-566-846-415; 077-660-831-197-084; 082-431-493-160-474; 095-772-638-454-148; 104-963-683-392-202; 105-661-127-972-09X; 111-666-231-523-104; 114-835-602-256-142,0,false,,

Recent years have indeed assisted in drawing attention to the human-centric design of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) and to the genesis of the ‘Operator 4.0’, two novel concepts that raise significant ethical questions regarding the impact of technology on workers and society at large. This paper argues that a value-oriented and ethical technology engineering in Industry 5.0 is an urgent and sensitive topic as demonstrated by a survey administered to industry leaders from different companies. The Value Sensitive Design (VSD) approach is proposed as a principled framework to illustrate how technologies enabling human–machine symbiosis in the Factory of the Future can be designed to embody elicited human values and to illustrate actionable steps that engineers and designers can take in their design projects. Use cases based on real solutions and prototypes discuss how a design-for-values approach aids in the investigation and mitigation of ethical issues emerging from the implementation of technological solutions and, hence, support the migration to a symbiotic Factory of the Future.",10,12,1,25,Engineering management; Engineering; Situated; Work (electrical); Value (ethics); Industry 4.0; Production (economics); Value sensitive design; Use case; Factory (object-oriented programming),,,,,https://iris.unito.it/bitstream/2318/1741791/1/applsci-10-04182.pdf https://iris.unito.it/handle/2318/1741791 https://philpapers.org/rec/LONVAE https://research.tudelft.nl/en/publications/value-oriented-and-ethical-technology-engineering-in-industry-50- https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/12/4182/pdf https://iris.unical.it/handle/20.500.11770/317633 https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/12/4182/htm https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/326909057.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app10124182,,10.3390/app10124182,3036816925,,0,000-069-943-339-065; 003-098-121-921-779; 005-988-234-681-537; 015-750-890-950-793; 015-896-365-180-470; 016-131-629-212-360; 018-204-409-632-280; 022-001-976-911-088; 025-370-045-015-261; 030-538-455-823-808; 040-192-597-123-492; 046-744-066-303-436; 047-344-167-153-151; 049-816-999-056-296; 053-530-162-809-509; 058-047-952-980-10X; 060-262-622-370-337; 065-513-914-579-314; 065-934-347-978-866; 067-193-950-421-226; 071-366-058-731-140; 073-439-602-104-579; 081-480-253-364-624; 085-371-017-012-953; 088-362-827-564-703; 089-002-311-968-886; 090-864-273-291-919; 091-910-554-720-952; 091-928-035-899-634; 097-680-341-242-51X; 101-535-958-642-486; 104-547-438-104-462; 113-262-515-060-959; 120-329-562-811-556; 125-795-343-058-314; 173-954-144-095-944,78,true,cc-by,gold

This study aims to determine the grouping of students’ mind sets in two growth and fixed categories, knowing the description of mind set content and internet entrepreneurial behavior in students, knowing the differences in internet entrepreneurial behavior based on student mindsets, knowing the correlation between mind set and internet entrepreneurial behavior, then know the contribution of mindset to internet entrepreneurial behavior. This research method with a quantitative approach, using a likert scale questionnaire instrument, the sample is students registered at UPI YPTK Padang in 2018/2019 academic year totaling 148 people, sampling from the population is done by purposive sampling technique, data analysis with percentage techniques in describing data, independent test sample t test for different tests, pearson correlation product moment analysis for testing the relationship of variables and the square of r for testing the contribution. The results of the analysis state that 45% of students with a fixed mind set and 55% with a growth mind set, students with a growth mind set have better internet entrepreneurial behavior with an average of 86.82%. Hypothesis testing states that there are differences in student internet entrepreneurial behavior based on personal mindsets, there is a fairly strong correlation between mind set with internet entrepreneurial behavior, with a contribution of 20.4%. It is proven that students with growth mindsets have higher behavior in internet entrepreneurial activities, therefore to increase the ability and interest of students in entrepreneurship must start from the approach to the correct mindset about entrepreneurship. </jats:p>",22,1,1,,The Internet; Sociology; Mindset; Public relations; Entrepreneurship,,,,,http://jurnal.unpad.ac.id/sosiohumaniora/article/viewFile/25625/12930 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/295384455.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.24198/sosiohumaniora.v22i1.25625,,10.24198/sosiohumaniora.v22i1.25625,3010971976,,0,,0,true,cc-by-sa,gold
118-456-142-980-433,Defining reg tech terms,2020-07-10,2020,book chapter,,,,,Gennette Zimmer,"Abstract This chapter goes beyond simply defining terms by providing an overview of the entire technology and data ecosystem (within and beyond the food industry) so that readers are able to differentiate between Blockchain, cryptocurrency and ledgers, as well as smart contracts and the cloud. A deep look at disruptive technology and innovation in retail highlights the diversity of the future of food safety technology. Food systems and food supply chains (FSCs) have undergone significant changes in their operations and structure over the last decade as globalization expands both food choice and availability. As FSCs lengthen, and food passes through extended trading relationships, transparency on food origins, methods of cultivation, harvest, processing as well as labor conditions and sustainability are reduced, along with food trust. Moreover, while the rapid pace of technology innovation benefits FSCs, we are witness to the usage of social media platforms by citizen-consumers to amplify the rhetoric related to recurring incidents and crises in food quality, food safety, food fraud, food security, sustainability, and other ethical lapses. Furthermore, we are witness to new evidence on the global burden of foodborne diseases, including noncommunicable diseases that range from severe malnutrition to morbid obesity and from severe illnesses requiring hospitalization to mortality. The World Health Organization claims that 31 foodborne hazards cause 600 million illnesses and 420,000 deaths annually. Overcoming these challenges requires a holistic reframing of our food systems and societal challenges. The emergence of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provides an overarching framework for collaboration and alignment. Japan has put forward a vision for a human-centric, technology-enabled future branded as “Society 5.0.” Increasingly, the redesign of FSCs necessitates a concerted, multistakeholder effort and the development of digitization strategies in order to cope with the evolution toward the vision of Society 5.0 and to achieve the UN SDGs.",,,1,42,Business; Marketing; Food choice; Globalization; Food industry; Food safety; Food security; Sustainable development; Sustainability; Food systems,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128189566000014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128189566000014,,,3041301066,,0,,0,false,,

In Society 5.0, a massive amount of data from the sensor will rapidly accumulate in cloud services. It requires enormous bandwidth and high-speed communication than can be achieved by using optical fiber as a transmission media. However, chromatic dispersion will limit the bandwidth and data rate due to pulse broadening, which needs compensation. Among many compensation techniques for optical fiber systems, this research investigates the effects of dispersion compensating fiber (DCF) in a single-mode-fiber (SMF) using a 10 Gbps bit rate at various source power levels. This research considers three different schemes of DCF, i.e., pre-compensation, post-compensation, and symmetrical compensation with NRZ modulation format at transmission distances up to 200 km simulated by using OptiSystem. The results show that the dispersion effect can be compensated by the proposed DCF scheme. Also, the use of amplifiers should be considered to compensate for the high attenuation effect of DCF. The system performance showed that using a three different scheme of DCF could provide a good system performance and reach a transmission distance of 200 km.",,,,,Dispersion (optics); Single-mode optical fiber; Optical fiber; Electronic engineering; Bandwidth (computing); Compensation (engineering); Computer science; Transmission medium; Transmission (telecommunications); Insertion loss,,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=9538764 http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9538520/9538628/09538764.pdf?arnumber=9538764,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/gecost52368.2021.9538764,,10.1109/gecost52368.2021.9538764,3201563743,,0,017-851-482-778-854; 018-880-086-685-073; 019-295-994-749-967; 023-987-656-824-751; 027-792-232-328-637; 030-380-575-036-270; 031-246-204-945-642; 035-477-564-014-79X; 067-339-791-465-465; 089-004-015-063-088; 095-824-400-963-673; 097-153-356-334-607; 120-794-564-508-132,0,false,,

This study used a total of 217 responses adopting the cross-sectional survey research design from manufacturing SMEs owners/founders. The results were analysed using PLS-SEM via SmartPLS version 3.3.3. The major findings established that entrepreneurial orientation did not directly link with the sustainable growth of SMEs. The study confirmed that market orientation and resource orientation revealed a direct and significant positive link with the sustainable growth of SMEs. Similarly, innovation competitive advantage has a direct significant positive association with the sustainable growth of SMEs. Likewise, entrepreneurial orientation and market orientation have a direct and significant positive relationship with innovation competitive advantage. However, resource orientation did not significantly relate to innovation competitive advantage. The findings validated that innovation competitive advantage mediated the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation, market orientation, and the sustainable growth of SMEs. Finally, innovation competitive advantage did not mediate between resource orientation and sustainable growth of SMEs, which have not previously been proven in empirical studies. This study was designed to address the existing gaps and provide reasons to prove them.

First, numerous studies are conceptual in nature with limited practicality. Second, there are relatively few empirical studies, and often the findings relate to a single case study based on the insights of a limited number of senior managers.

123-745-968-235-511,Insight into the Balancing Effect of a Digital Green Innovation (DGI) Network to Improve the Performance of DGI for Industry 5.0: Roles of Digital Empowerment and Green Organization Flexibility,2022-07-05,2022,journal article,Systems,20798954,MDPI AG,,Chengli Hu; Hongtao Yang; Shi Yin,"<jats:p>Under the background of double carbon target and digital intelligence era, the innovation resources and innovation environment that manufacturing enterprises rely on have shown exponential growth. Digital green innovation (DGI) has gradually become the mainstream paradigm of innovation. How to achieve a balance between a local DGI network (LDGIN) and a remote DGI network (RDGIN) and how to use the role of digital empowerment and green organization flexibility to improve the performance of DGI are very important issues facing manufacturing enterprises at present. However, this problem has not been fully addressed in the existing research. In this study, the influence mechanism of LDGIN and RDGIN on the DGI performance of manufacturing enterprises was revealed, considering the moderating role of digital empowerment and green organization flexibility. The linear regression method was used to analyze the 562 valid data obtained by questionnaire survey. The results of this study are as follows. The effect of the DGI network on manufacturing enterprises’ DGI performance is heterogeneous because of LDGIN and RDGIN. The establishment of embedded links in a DGI network inevitably requires manufacturing enterprises to pay the corresponding costs. The over-embedding of manufacturing enterprises into RDGIN will have a negative impact on DGI performance. The balance between LDGIN and RDGIN has an important impact on manufacturing enterprises’ operation. The comprehensive balance and relative balance indexes constructed in this paper show that an appropriate balance can promote the improvement of the DGI performance of manufacturing enterprises. Digital transformation and organizational structure innovation are changing the business model of manufacturing enterprises and can regulate the relationship between the LDGIN and RDGIN and the DGI performance of manufacturing enterprises. The balance of DGI network embedding in practice shows the important role and enlightening significance of local and remote search in developing countries.</jats:p>",10,4,97,97,Flexibility (engineering); Business; Industrial organization; Manufacturing; Digital transformation; Balance (ability); Process management; Operations management; Computer science,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/systems10040097,,10.3390/systems10040097,,,0,000-905-205-541-553; 001-998-899-553-736; 002-675-386-476-536; 003-079-085-633-847; 006-208-215-788-351; 007-876-983-918-032; 009-065-722-352-740; 009-121-014-555-057; 012-377-342-003-136; 012-836-919-511-187; 013-044-191-813-561; 013-752-033-907-797; 015-628-088-610-602; 016-320-267-172-324; 016-595-734-832-25X; 017-747-964-995-413; 018-557-923-448-236; 020-490-193-487-45X; 021-843-543-155-568; 021-870-293-444-335; 021-993-970-323-208; 022-053-613-750-865; 024-229-385-077-195; 024-233-361-244-86X; 024-513-049-354-50X; 025-606-063-549-02X; 025-614-564-772-051; 025-920-132-689-575; 026-861-169-641-750; 028-248-497-041-049; 028-942-189-455-610; 029-074-671-542-148; 030-101-051-833-426; 034-496-467-458-505; 034-617-094-108-737; 035-466-391-061-171; 037-207-588-109-673; 039-024-640-828-300; 041-689-645-906-978; 042-886-903-959-052; 044-765-909-900-408; 045-592-491-973-16X; 047-851-862-670-675; 051-906-996-843-324; 051-969-797-133-31X; 052-230-732-286-834; 057-845-219-652-066; 058-108-144-684-00X; 059-115-149-350-078; 060-530-272-312-118; 064-277-795-970-530; 072-180-038-418-30X; 072-339-930-820-086; 073-053-229-980-025; 074-654-255-187-127; 076-723-973-008-305; 080-023-771-764-820; 081-366-195-602-129; 086-764-418-688-886; 086-936-540-313-752; 087-690-399-614-159; 087-873-725-055-498; 088-268-841-136-819; 094-275-122-264-980; 094-936-615-846-124; 098-941-243-510-970; 101-362-936-249-875; 101-892-923-066-269; 102-077-220-210-493; 103-263-291-368-971; 103-283-428-251-546; 104-294-026-807-580; 112-074-051-269-556; 117-316-045-696-341; 133-722-662-751-530; 142-366-944-206-176; 157-644-507-299-695; 159-230-690-402-381; 166-295-681-583-169; 170-694-723-712-460; 171-564-090-961-053; 171-802-905-729-337; 172-510-878-345-451; 198-832-570-152-835; 199-243-720-910-859; 199-297-378-932-350; 199-999-351-308-968,0,true,cc-by,gold

Sreenath,"Developing technologies, advancement in science, evolving globalized perspectives and the massive dependence on digital platform for a routine sustenance has led to the core building of Industry 4.0. In general, industry 4.0 focuses on the metamorphosis of all industrial components with the help of strong digital support. It's very often interlinked with the successful fourth industrial revolution. It is to be noted that the very fourth outburst of industrialization plunges forward in order to achieve an optimized and sustained form of production. With the uplift of the fourth generation of this stirring revolution, the efficient extraction of advanced informatics analytics along with internetworked machines have grown to a great extent, complementing the digital platform. On the other hand, society 5.0 involves a human centric community which is capable of striking a balance between the economical proliferations and resolving societal liabilities by the core combination of cyber and physical space. Just like how industry 4.0 carries out the digital transformation of every industrial perspective, society 5.0 encourages mundane life to leap towards a digital revamp expanding across different tiers of the community. Indeed, the rapid change of information and Communication Technology along with the portrayal of society 5.0 as a global trend and a key aspect of the Science and Technology Basic plan, the interplay of the two proves to be a constant support for each other. This paper discusses about the future look of industry 4.0 and society 5.0 and elaborates on the challenges and opportunities rooted from them.",,,,,Engineering management; Digital transformation; Sustenance; Industry 4.0; Computer science; Industrialisation; Industrial Revolution; Plan (drawing); Information and Communications Technology; Analytics,,,,,http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9402219/9402221/09402498.pdf?arnumber=9402498 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=9402498,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iccci50826.2021.9402498,,10.1109/iccci50826.2021.9402498,3157561883,,0,007-893-540-948-00X; 015-008-734-610-504; 016-960-237-498-599; 019-763-285-018-963; 020-555-574-954-829; 027-192-978-746-115; 033-333-885-606-168; 062-757-415-379-846; 064-042-765-914-689; 072-329-848-195-489; 086-885-197-186-655; 088-865-245-126-222; 100-137-794-930-923; 102-424-326-687-39X; 104-963-683-392-202; 105-049-891-404-994; 107-308-686-388-40X; 113-767-551-070-365; 170-563-722-411-658,17,false,,

Tookey; Ali GhaffarianHoseini; Amirhosein GhaffarianHoseini,"<jats:p>The construction industry’s inherent fragmentation fuels Construction Supply Chain (CSC) complexity. Logistics form an essential part of the CSC in terms of costs and project management. In turn, transportation accounts for more than half the logistics costs due to construction materials being low-cost/high-volume, and most other logistics processes being business processes and not physical ones. Construction transport is almost entirely road bound, one of the least sustainable modes with externalities far out of proportion to its numbers. Ergo, its optimisation presents substantial greening (de-carbonisation) opportunity, with potentially far-reaching sustainability impacts. The ASI (Avoid-Shift-Improve) concept considers activity, modal structure, and energy intensity/efficiency as transport carbon components, providing a fundamental optimisation framework. 93% of New Zealand’s freight (a third of it construction related) is road bound, with 99% fossil-fuel (diesel) dependence.

How shared economy can perform a superlative role in augmenting the corporate sustainable performance is another interesting gap that needs to be unveiled. This study investigates the linkage between shared economy practices and corporate triple bottom line (TBL) in three core streams—environmental performance (ENVP), social performance (SP), and economic performance (EP)—using empirical data. An additional factor of industry 5.0 (i5.0) technologies was treated as a moderator between shared economy and TBL. The findings assured the positive nexus of shared economy (i.e., contract manufacturing services, professional services, data entry &amp; clerical services, creative and multimedia services, sales and marketing services, software development services, and writing or translation services) on TBL (i.e., ENVP, SP, and EP). The positive moderating influence of i5.0 technologies was further affirmed between the relationships of shared economy and TBL. The findings yield multidimensional insights for operational management to adopt shared economy and i5.0 practices to improve corporate TBL in today’s competitive era. In addition, this study accentuates the notion of shared economy by providing positive evidence from developing nations.

128-419-307-357-552,Multi-Scale Assessment of the Economic Impacts of Flooding: Evidence from Firm to Macro-Level Analysis in the Chinese Manufacturing Sector,2019-04-01,2019,journal article,Sustainability,20711050,MDPI AG,Switzerland,Xi Hu; Raghav Pant; Jim W. Hall; Swenja Surminski; Jiashun Huang,"We present an empirical study to systemically estimate flooding impacts, linking across scales from individual firms through to the macro levels in China. To this end, we combine a detailed firm-level econometric analysis of 399,356 firms with a macroeconomic input-output model to estimate flood impacts on China’s manufacturing sector over the period 2003–2010. We find that large flooding events on average reduce firm outputs (measured by labor productivity) by about 28.3% per year. Using an input-output analysis, we estimate the potential macroeconomic impact to be a 12.3% annual loss in total output, which amounts to 15,416 RMB billion. Impacts can propagate from manufacturing firms, which are the focus of our empirical analysis, through to other economic sectors that may not actually be located in floodplains but can still be affected by economic disruptions. Lagged flood effects over the following two years are estimated to be a further 5.4% at the firm level and their associated potential effects are at a 2.3% loss in total output or 2,486 RMB billion at the macro-level. These results indicate that the scale of economic impacts from flooding is much larger than microanalyses of direct damage indicate, thus justifying greater action, at a policy level and by individual firms, to manage flood risk.",11,7,1933,,Empirical research; Economic sector; Floodplain; Economics; Natural resource economics; Flooding (psychology); Economic impact analysis; Productivity; Scale (social sciences); Flood myth,,,,"St. Antony's College, University of Oxford; European Commission; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council",https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/100534/ https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/7/1933 https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jsusta/v11y2019i7p1933-d218995.html https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/7/1933/pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/196515473.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11071933,,10.3390/su11071933,2932002163,,0,002-199-418-778-455; 002-232-213-447-881; 003-777-742-922-525; 004-110-527-848-001; 006-262-118-172-667; 008-128-467-093-858; 014-538-173-799-934; 014-633-411-314-61X; 015-118-897-816-141; 017-564-088-930-334; 018-884-205-039-540; 022-306-112-266-760; 031-580-347-742-774; 032-307-520-377-432; 035-998-338-159-45X; 036-259-536-096-856; 037-310-947-988-821; 038-196-787-346-28X; 038-950-551-709-760; 043-488-731-053-870; 044-009-867-458-063; 044-893-017-201-376; 048-125-002-973-844; 049-633-165-420-619; 057-302-574-206-57X; 057-952-755-304-253; 067-092-963-652-696; 067-529-002-697-026; 072-901-026-059-01X; 073-497-874-542-56X; 075-442-434-893-061; 087-463-945-415-254; 089-649-460-325-849; 096-427-271-664-462; 104-728-694-241-530; 144-472-182-448-516; 145-581-989-589-706; 160-507-931-573-080; 169-113-246-589-944,8,true,cc-by,gold

At the same time, wireless communications are becoming crucial to smart manufacturing within the scope of Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 is a developing trend of high-speed data exchange in automation for manufacturing technologies and is referred to as the fourth industrial revolution. This trend requires fast, reliable, low-latency, and cost-effective data transmissions with fast synchronizations to ensure smooth operations for various processes. VLC is capable of providing reliable, low-latency, and secure connections that do not penetrate walls and is immune to electromagnetic interference. As such, this paper aims to show the potential of VLC for industrial wireless applications by examining the latest research work in VLC systems. This work also highlights and classifies challenges that might arise with the applicability of VLC and visible light positioning (VLP) systems in these settings. Given the previous work performed in these areas, and the major ongoing experimental projects looking into the use of VLC systems for industrial applications, the use of VLC and VLP systems for industrial applications shows promising potential.",9,12,2157,,Automation; Visible light communication; Electromagnetic interference; Scope (project management); Optical wireless; Computer science; Wireless; Information and Communications Technology; Telecommunications,,,,Horizon 2020,https://northumbria-test.eprints-hosting.org/id/document/273257 https://researchportal.northumbria.ac.uk/en/publications/visible-light-communications-for-industrial-applicationschallenge https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/9/12/2157/htm https://researchportal.northumbria.ac.uk/files/39897729/electronics-09-02157-v2.pdf https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/9/12/2157/pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/362990839.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics9122157,,10.3390/electronics9122157,3111288590,,0,001-295-302-541-978; 003-886-937-447-317; 005-585-755-143-674; 005-689-703-408-42X; 005-771-884-036-815; 006-907-893-118-878; 007-888-301-193-264; 008-023-963-020-411; 008-404-008-444-741; 009-581-709-682-623; 010-396-993-255-776; 010-402-738-806-583; 010-795-135-653-194; 011-077-825-505-973; 011-129-645-989-095; 011-843-051-919-047; 011-973-514-614-633; 013-853-095-137-591; 013-965-875-718-449; 014-014-100-814-024; 015-946-094-673-240; 016-402-490-651-722; 016-726-296-395-703; 017-415-713-662-955; 017-444-483-537-210; 017-922-771-237-988; 018-488-841-195-734; 019-739-439-041-454; 020-017-449-802-57X; 020-307-435-710-370; 020-580-113-023-145; 021-005-776-117-236; 022-011-600-040-906; 023-465-146-409-373; 023-914-675-223-145; 024-494-138-301-185; 024-990-668-392-208; 025-766-059-123-950; 026-380-570-072-673; 027-075-527-335-082; 028-174-739-162-216; 028-398-382-996-383; 028-573-718-470-621; 029-004-154-037-449; 029-621-538-666-870; 031-203-476-634-370; 031-721-655-733-278; 032-147-915-194-139; 032-657-638-942-783; 032-735-102-772-529; 033-244-426-609-541; 033-274-213-180-662; 033-320-841-894-978; 034-499-768-608-048; 035-553-466-535-243; 035-835-295-750-12X; 036-055-465-565-824; 036-819-217-681-84X; 037-486-070-555-999; 037-568-618-992-449; 038-270-546-991-109; 038-406-633-043-713; 040-389-188-043-204; 041-822-593-755-273; 041-999-636-043-158; 042-452-316-634-087; 043-455-992-944-005; 044-642-569-456-565; 044-877-012-478-835; 046-917-117-499-591; 048-152-610-866-747; 049-038-507-010-526; 049-583-774-399-293; 050-188-425-306-912; 050-997-950-548-215; 052-484-611-263-265; 053-289-666-047-677; 053-306-661-254-249; 054-324-922-995-682; 055-587-987-189-48X; 055-842-833-383-71X; 056-257-301-645-888; 056-685-037-542-804; 057-298-631-130-665; 058-693-555-538-891; 058-819-526-264-677; 059-263-707-236-611; 059-325-602-164-560; 059-345-031-889-346; 059-674-482-572-695; 060-129-342-788-365; 060-683-016-918-134; 062-232-255-022-28X; 062-716-279-884-491; 062-737-639-449-884; 062-760-407-185-74X; 065-743-962-266-965; 066-619-120-842-995; 067-692-253-332-785; 068-338-686-818-638; 068-645-611-992-623; 069-152-587-871-602; 069-236-662-292-167; 069-407-228-070-354; 069-950-521-975-675; 070-539-498-378-711; 072-357-998-469-56X; 072-603-156-089-465; 072-748-467-775-013; 073-192-731-763-114; 073-506-539-317-607; 073-963-217-245-384; 074-756-556-757-709; 075-132-515-900-573; 075-467-201-498-387; 076-072-873-565-570; 077-356-972-249-89X; 078-651-219-450-33X; 078-697-448-069-931; 082-661-955-585-527; 082-947-153-132-378; 083-201-456-373-190; 083-371-330-948-237; 083-579-385-490-828; 083-769-842-199-460; 084-187-176-729-859; 085-687-301-980-418; 085-793-760-767-818; 085-840-254-001-181; 086-959-572-774-395; 087-848-994-153-796; 088-818-412-419-865; 089-663-594-943-766; 089-801-955-872-602; 089-865-246-285-803; 090-540-000-860-441; 092-323-231-992-742; 094-976-416-538-58X; 098-952-889-146-868; 101-856-080-590-450; 102-424-326-687-39X; 103-001-104-183-489; 107-271-047-139-371; 108-275-468-824-654; 110-351-248-381-453; 110-550-134-896-856; 110-641-472-718-749; 112-553-229-487-891; 114-762-342-801-225; 116-334-056-876-594; 116-438-947-818-44X; 117-964-265-984-893; 119-677-215-435-029; 120-902-340-205-509; 122-525-990-773-171; 123-167-066-993-012; 123-894-479-808-509; 124-479-806-648-37X; 126-954-921-857-022; 130-103-712-690-376; 132-589-810-351-496; 134-597-731-467-354; 136-815-595-063-560; 137-042-125-417-285; 139-696-665-502-507; 141-320-979-384-896; 142-767-569-842-150; 149-123-179-326-688; 150-777-956-906-301; 151-285-189-365-510; 152-826-577-650-079; 154-123-663-400-676; 154-422-125-418-73X; 158-833-011-569-136; 158-906-834-532-347; 158-977-045-181-255; 160-801-734-658-437; 161-000-456-671-792; 169-866-362-853-315; 170-061-625-445-549; 172-795-633-788-475; 176-583-439-390-018; 189-802-340-166-39X; 193-311-056-197-816,21,true,cc-by,gold

Baburin,"<jats:p>The article examines the influence of natural history and socio-cultural processes on the formation of industrial areas within the borders of modern Russia and partially the Russian Empire and the USSR. Basically, the evolutionary approach is used in the version of cyclic genetic dynamics. To assess the long-term effects of the “path dependence”, we analyze the 150-year cycle of industrialization within the borders of Historical Russia. To do this, we use the mechanisms of spatial localization of Kondratiev cycles and associated technological structures of the first (first-second), second (third-fourth)) and the third (fifth) industrial revolution. As an information base, data on the number of people employed and the volume of industrial production (in comparable prices) are used, and for the XX century, data on the dynamics of fixed assets of industry are also used. The relationship between modernization schemes on the old basis (within the boundaries of old industrial areas) and in the areas of pioneer development is revealed. The stability of industry specializations within the grid of industrial areas is considered separately. Based on the results obtained, the conclusion is made about the stability of old industrial cores of localization of industrial potential, the continuity of the spectrum of their specializations (not the replacement of old industries with new ones, but the addition). There is also a repetition in the regions of the new development of the General scheme of the chosen path and the inherited track.</jats:p>",,3,26,39,Economics; Economic geography; Production (economics); Path dependence,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5922/1994-5280-2020-3-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.5922/1994-5280-2020-3-3,,10.5922/1994-5280-2020-3-3,3119247830,,0,021-121-543-879-270; 053-380-318-319-565; 054-915-064-259-180; 057-091-449-818-019; 058-477-259-753-451; 080-699-713-713-777; 128-758-293-802-470; 138-668-634-380-370,0,false,,

Almost all technology developed and created comes from research carried out on an ongoing basis and using a scientific approach. Science learning is currently developing and adapting to the needs of the times. The development of science occurs by utilizing collaboration with other branches of science such as technology, mechanical engineering, and mathematics. The distinctive feature of collaboration that has become an important value in IR 4.0 also occurs in the field of education. Big Data, as the hallmark of Society 5.0, is the source of big data that makes education more effective and efficient. In addition, the use of Education Technology (EdTech) can also support collaborative transportation and use of data. MEXT (2018) makes a leading project as a form of planning and compilation of science learning towards Society 5.0 through 3 important and essential steps, including: providing diverse opportunities and learning spaces to achieve “fair, individually optimized learning”, ensuring that all students acquire basic academic abilities such as basic reading skills, mathematical thinking, and information literacy skills, are not involved in the humanity or knowledge gap. The success of science learning can be supported by several branches of science such as Physics, Computer science, Natural science, Mathematics and modeling, Teaching and learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, STEM-based classroom management, Robotic and game teaching in science education, Instructional technology and application in science education, Training and professional development for STEM teachers, STEM curriculum in science education, Computer-based learning, Learning Innovations and Evaluation, Design and implementation of a technology-rich learning environment, Distance learning on education.</jats:p>;                <jats:p>Therefore, I thank all participants for International Conference on Science Education and Technology (ICOSETH 2019) who have contributed their research to develop Science education to face Industrial Revolution 4.0 and Society 5.0.

In 1988, the term Lean emerged and this philosophy successfully challenged the mass production implemented in the automotive industry, focused on customers’ requirements and satisfaction with the minimum use of resources and waste elimination. A Lean environment can be a promoter in the implementation of the fourth industrial revolution, named Industry 4.0 (I4.0). In the succession of Industry 4.0 emerged the Society 5.0 in Japan, as a strategy to deal with the impact of an ageing population. The focus of this quiet revolution is the humankind and the creation of conditions to promote a happy, motivated and satisfied society with more time for leisure and consequently increase productivity and wealth.

The emergence of Society 5.0 era demands a balance between technology and the environment. But on the other hand, the emergence of the Society 5.0 era was not matched by the formation of digital ethics in society. The rise of cybercrime cases such as the spread of fake news (hoaxes), hate speech, and cyberbullying shows the lack of digital ethics in society. The formation of digital ethics is an important thing that must be done, one of which is through digital citizenship education in society. The method used in this research is qualitative with a case study approach. Data collection was carried out through observation and in-depth interviews with several main sources, namely the community board of Kampung Cyber and community members based on purposive sampling and snowball sampling techniques. The results showed that the emergence of the Kampung Cyber community became the main forum for the implementation of digital citizenship education in society, especially in shaping ethics. The application of norms in society becomes the main control for any deviant actions in the use of technology. It takes the development of competencies and digital ethical values that are in accordance with the era of Society 5.0, such as technological literacy, responsibility, honesty, critical thinking, problem solving, creativity, equality and local wisdom. The existence of a key figure as a model in social learning will shape people's behavior according to digital ethical competencies in the era of Society 5.0. In addition, it is necessary to create a good environment and strong ties in society that will encourage the successful formation of ideal and ethical digital citizenship in the era of Society 5.0.",9,5,948,956,Nonprobability sampling; Snowball sampling; Sociology; Globalization; Ideal (ethics); Honesty; Cybercrime; Public relations; Social learning; Information ethics,,,,,https://www.hrpub.org/journals/article_info.php?aid=10847,http://dx.doi.org/10.13189/ujer.2021.090507,,10.13189/ujer.2021.090507,3162604188,,0,,0,true,cc-by,gold

This article also presents several studies from the online journal article and the findings of previous research from thesis and dissertations and textbooks relating to the theory of blended learning. As an effort to reformulate PAI learning, it is important to implement blended learning in the current digital era. Islamic religious education has a material source that is extensive and strategic for the progress of the Indonesian nation. With most Indonesia's population is the follower of Islam, Islamic religious education as millennial generation literacy is appropriate to be formulated under the development of digital technology. Islamic education can take a strategic role as the immunization of the young generation amidst the advancement of learning and innovation. Blended learning is one of them in future learning. Blended learning is one of the latest learning models that has been successfully applied to educational institutions. This study describes blended learning as an effort to reformulate PAI learning in the digital era 4.0. This study also aims to be a reference for further research. This research was conducted with the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method of various research findings and the findings of journal articles relating to the blended learning. The findings of the study showed that the principle of blended learning synergize a balanced combination between face-to-face and online learning. It can apply blended learning to PAI learning and is quite successful. Using technology will strengthen the conventional methods that commonly occur in PAI learning so that PAI learning is more effective and efficient. Some research states that blended learning has motivated students in learning, enables students to be more creative, more active, more participatory, more communicative, independent and able to solve problems in learning, improving learning outcomes. We can conclude it that the results regarding blended learning are having a positive impact on student development and also on learning outcomes.",7,2,119,129,Mathematics education; Psychology; Blended learning; Systematic review; Religious education; Citizen journalism; Action (philosophy); Population; Islam; Literacy,,,,,https://journal.iain-samarinda.ac.id/index.php/syamil/article/download/1827/pdf https://journal.iain-samarinda.ac.id/index.php/syamil/article/view/1827 https://journal.uinsi.ac.id/index.php/syamil/article/view/1827 https://core.ac.uk/download/287357696.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.21093/sy.v7i2.1827,,10.21093/sy.v7i2.1827,2998532115,,0,,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Today, it is no longer possible to consider it a homogeneous group of trainees with a significant age difference. Different methods and tools are available to acquire knowledge. Digital technology, changes in time management, and changes in the way information is processed require new methods in adult learning. The acquisition of knowledge is necessary to enable workers to contribute to the digitization of the operating characteristics of production equipment and machinery in the context of Industry 4.0 and, on the other hand, to enable the combination of robotic and human skills to be launched in the 21<jats:sup>st</jats:sup> century through Industry 5.0. In our research, we examine the perspectives of adult education institutions, adult education professionals, and the people involved in adult education to ameliorate the use of digital technology in adult education as effectively as possible. We looked at the readiness and openness of institutions and trainers and the digital competencies and expectations of adult learning users of different generations.

Its efficient functioning depends on the implementation of SDG activities and the development of industry (first-fourth/fifth industrial revolution). Due to the likelihood of different priorities in the implementation of the sustainable development goals, it is important to build such relationships, e.g. in the supply chain, so that their implementation could take place under similar conditions. Digitization, or the circular economy concept (CE), create an opportunity for the SME sector to build relationships as part of industry networks, for instance, where the managed supply chain would have a common and realistic goal to achieve. This goal will be a priority in business models based on sustainable development. The article presents the results of research regarding the furniture industry in Poland (key industry, referred to as smart specialization). The results of the analysis show that the industry has a large production potential, and the natural resources used in it are constantly increasing. However, there are doubts raised by the lack of stability in the dynamics of the sold production in the industry. Ultimately, the business model of the industry supply chain should focus on the environmental aspect (sustainable management of the raw material supply chain) and on eco-friendly consumption (sustainable management of the product supply chain), so that it can be managed in a sustainable way.</jats:p>",29,3,227,234,Environmental economics; Business; Industry 4.0; Sustainable supply chain; Statistical analysis; Furniture industry; Natural resource; Sustainable development; Sustainability,,,,,https://sciendo.com/article/10.2478/mspe-2021-0028 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MSPE...29..227W/abstract https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/mspe-2021-0028 https://bazekon.uek.krakow.pl/rekord/171624158,http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/mspe-2021-0028,,10.2478/mspe-2021-0028,3176588589,,0,004-354-593-478-345; 011-053-116-114-295; 013-044-719-719-355; 018-402-956-890-614; 020-171-452-840-951; 021-315-943-430-048; 029-347-882-391-037; 041-227-869-131-490; 042-704-326-369-30X; 044-054-748-132-469; 044-968-660-415-369; 053-262-593-876-369; 060-973-085-586-626; 063-795-614-122-262; 070-621-486-013-363; 075-771-045-127-838; 081-648-774-299-190; 082-963-215-399-060; 083-685-083-819-498; 100-890-534-337-672; 101-444-577-009-739; 103-277-511-768-123; 106-645-111-629-04X; 112-538-540-416-089; 147-795-555-777-175; 148-482-715-509-006; 199-441-316-870-311,3,true,cc-by,gold

Deterioration of private demand -- as a result of economic crisis and increase of unemployment – has been the main reason of worsening global trade. This condition has, of course, affected economic performance of countries through trade channels. Furthermore, the recent trade agenda following to Trump administration has created another uncertainty to the world economy. This paper studies the impact of new trade agenda, which is represented by Trump’s plan on trade policy, to the world economy as well as to Indonesian and Japanese economy in particular. The analysis is based on computable general equilibrium of GTAP model version 6, with two scenarios: (i) Trump Trade Agenda when implementing 45 and 35 percent tariff to China and Mexico; (ii) Trade Hit List when imposing tariff to the 16 countries in the trade hit list. Impacts of both scenarios are examined in short run and long run. The results suggest that both scenarios in the short run will not create any significant effect to global economy as whole nor to Indonesian and Japan in particular. However, their impacts to the global economy, Indonesia, and Japan will be substantial in the long run. Therefore, Indonesia and Japan in particular should concern on providing sound economic policies to reduce the risk of new trade agenda to these economies in the long run. Some policy recommendation provided in this paper are: (i) Japan should focus on improving technological innovation to realize the implementation of society 5.0 and industry 4.0 as scheduled; (ii) Indonesia should facilitate more investment to its economy and provide more government investment to induce accumulation of capital stock in the future. Furthermore, efficiencies and technological adoption should also be main concern of the Indonesian government to induce productivity of the economy and help mitigate the global risks in the long run.",20,2,181,202,Commercial policy; Economics; Trade barrier; International economics; Short run; Computable general equilibrium; World economy; Foreign direct investment; Free trade; Economic integration,,,,,https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/download/8825.pdf https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/res_display.asp?RecordID=5435 http://www.journalbankindonesia.org/index.php/BEMP/article/view/811 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/234039028.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.21098/bemp.v20i2.811,,10.21098/bemp.v20i2.811,2767024960,,0,019-646-269-458-632; 075-316-510-480-748,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The development of wettable peatland products and services (termed 'Paludiculture') present significant opportunities for enabling a transition away from peat-harvesting (fossil fuels) to developing 'green' eco-innovations. However, this must be balanced with sustainable carbon sequestration and environmental protection. This complex transition from 'brown to green' must be met in real time by enabling digital technologies across the full value chain. This will potentially necessitate creation of new green-business models with the potential to support disruptive innovation. This timely paper describes digital transformation of paludiculture-based eco-innovation that will potentially lead to a paradigm shift towards using smart digital technologies to address efficiency of products and services along with future-proofing for climate change. Digital transform of paludiculture also aligns with the 'Industry 5.0 - a human-centric solution'. However, companies supporting peatland innovation may lack necessary standards, data-sharing or capabilities that can also affect viable business model propositions that can jeopardize economic, political and social sustainability. Digital solutions may reduce costs, increase productivity, improve produce develop, and achieve faster time to market for paludiculture. Digitisation also enables information systems to be open, interoperable, and user-friendly. This constitutes the first study to describe the digital transformation of paludiculture, both vertically and horizontally, in order to inform sustainability that includes process automation via AI, machine learning, IoT-Cloud informed sensors and robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and blockchain for cyber-physical systems.

Fernández-Caramés,"Industry 5.0 follows the steps of the Industry 4.0 paradigm and seeks for revolutionizing the way industries operate. In fact, Industry 5.0 focuses on research and innovation to support industrial production sustainability and place the well-being of industrial workers at the center of the production process. Thus, Industry 5.0 relies on three pillars: it is human-centric, it encourages sustainability and it is aimed at developing resilience against disruptions. Such core aspects cannot be fully achieved without a transparent end-to-end human-centered traceability throughout the value chain. As a consequence, Auto-Identification (Auto-ID) technologies play a key role, since they are able to provide automated item recognition, positioning and tracking without human intervention or in cooperation with industrial operators. Although the most popular Auto-ID technologies provide a certain degree of security and productivity, there are still open challenges for future Industry 5.0 factories. This article analyzes and evaluates the Auto-ID landscape and delivers a holistic perspective and understanding of the most popular and the latest technologies, looking for solutions that cope with harsh, diverse and complex industrial scenarios. In addition, it describes a methodology for selecting Auto-ID technologies for Industry 5.0 factories. Such a methodology is applied to a specific use case of the shipbuilding industry that requires identifying the main components of a ship during its construction and repair. To validate the outcomes of the methodology, a practical evaluation of passive and active UHF RFID tags was performed in an Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV) under construction, showing that a careful selection and evaluation of the tags enables product identification and tracking even in areas with a very high density of metallic objects. As a result, this article serves as a useful guide for industrial stakeholders, including future developers and managers that seek for deploying identification and traceability technologies in Industry 5.0 scenarios.",9,,140700,140730,Value chain; Engineering management; Traceability; Productivity; Resilience (network); Computer science; Shipbuilding; Sustainability; Identification (information); Industrial production,,,,"Auto-Identification for Intelligent Products Research Line of the Navantia-Universidade da Coruña Joint Research Unit; Centro de Investigación de Galicia ‘‘CITIC,’’ funded by Xunta de Galicia and the European Union",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9568924/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/access/access9.html#Fraga-LamasVF21,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/access.2021.3119775,,10.1109/access.2021.3119775,3207468962,,0,001-278-005-207-805; 001-546-860-043-918; 004-166-427-330-988; 005-009-895-542-778; 005-120-454-948-399; 006-401-754-649-451; 006-473-931-536-785; 006-597-493-672-65X; 008-901-499-326-236; 009-319-552-038-229; 009-811-414-488-648; 010-678-180-101-919; 010-972-533-756-45X; 012-980-074-133-335; 013-906-709-625-300; 014-005-608-022-509; 015-376-955-790-27X; 015-379-736-621-533; 015-904-952-310-302; 017-992-423-449-064; 019-127-221-119-979; 019-507-714-158-41X; 020-411-988-724-22X; 021-381-653-186-206; 022-940-214-318-814; 024-216-957-807-956; 024-759-937-247-438; 025-016-433-045-559; 025-812-684-521-30X; 028-468-987-605-219; 028-878-826-824-156; 029-500-643-247-60X; 030-153-628-264-104; 030-454-393-823-694; 030-596-147-948-081; 032-669-882-780-518; 033-922-553-502-499; 034-456-604-262-749; 034-756-651-364-224; 035-001-577-402-886; 035-980-512-441-018; 036-966-645-054-578; 038-520-662-449-164; 040-155-961-291-028; 041-354-227-907-615; 041-428-887-893-385; 041-619-870-618-354; 042-093-217-014-059; 046-088-451-219-238; 047-081-220-569-112; 047-332-984-826-186; 047-501-098-246-691; 049-992-401-043-662; 050-132-665-727-967; 050-255-293-285-52X; 051-725-650-520-728; 052-224-103-560-692; 052-390-775-001-328; 052-494-377-392-470; 053-397-444-734-488; 054-456-489-723-014; 055-750-444-809-889; 056-073-085-085-970; 056-870-976-321-182; 059-888-951-393-15X; 060-837-277-507-922; 063-267-317-875-891; 063-464-410-845-817; 064-027-231-154-130; 066-453-436-263-175; 067-101-261-890-173; 067-720-682-234-265; 068-285-232-144-871; 070-095-101-153-65X; 070-443-361-568-040; 070-988-548-518-983; 072-866-616-899-739; 074-208-995-036-260; 074-922-158-294-244; 075-119-075-675-854; 075-996-258-734-495; 082-377-263-801-104; 082-499-278-147-374; 087-809-166-122-677; 088-281-655-337-496; 089-546-495-818-57X; 094-470-848-660-142; 094-605-271-493-575; 095-415-504-907-329; 096-939-794-456-629; 097-251-112-529-343; 099-512-497-462-340; 099-984-216-091-666; 101-492-691-728-717; 102-368-937-447-332; 105-325-269-383-124; 108-613-585-717-080; 109-714-723-126-043; 110-336-541-237-666; 111-060-687-206-768; 111-243-882-085-06X; 112-065-907-512-820; 112-092-847-584-112; 113-580-898-517-445; 118-897-021-077-022; 121-609-557-812-186; 127-492-767-676-786; 135-317-873-756-837; 137-151-051-197-074; 140-831-046-514-167; 141-142-753-807-009; 141-197-464-395-341; 142-097-324-189-026; 142-499-916-630-147; 142-884-955-765-627; 143-622-521-619-91X; 143-947-051-557-480; 150-233-135-089-265; 152-712-839-538-824; 154-291-711-271-876; 156-182-043-768-747; 161-314-741-186-763; 162-854-426-677-97X; 164-180-530-939-997; 172-328-304-723-678; 173-061-938-041-130; 179-974-650-785-864; 181-538-214-596-312; 189-894-145-764-360,9,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

Students are more likely to be introduced to the basic concepts of ethnoscience without involving how to integrate ethnoscience into science learning. The impact is that students’ scientific literacy is low. This is what underlies researchers to apply the Local Wisdom Integrated Science (LWIS) learning model by using local Madurese content to train students’ scientific literacy. The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in student scientific literacy after implementing the LWIS learning model in ethnoscience learning with local Madurese content. The method used was pre-experimental study with one group pretest-posttest design. When the study was carried out in the even semester of the 2019/2020 academic year by taking 22 students via purposive sampling technique as a sample of all students in class 6A of science education, Trunojoyo University, Madura. Analysis of data using descriptive statistics and paired sample t test. The results showed that there were different in the scientific literacy of the students using the LWIS learning model before and after studying ethnoscience with local Madurese material. The entire LWIS syntax helps train students' scientific literacy by including self-awareness of the importance of local Madurese content as a learning context. Ethnoscience can be integrated into science learning through the STEAM approach. The contribution of STEAM to the LWIS learning model and self-awareness is very significant in developing ethnoscience learning for local Madurese content from elementary, middle, and tertiary level.",7,2,103,112,Nonprobability sampling; Mathematics education; Psychology; Class (computer programming); Ethnoscience; Context (language use); Descriptive statistics; Science education; Literacy; Scientific literacy,,,,,https://journal.trunojoyo.ac.id/penasains/article/view/8445 https://journal.trunojoyo.ac.id/penasains/article/download/8445/LWIS%20Model https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/348690269.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.21107/jps.v7i2.8445,,10.21107/jps.v7i2.8445,3096010399,,0,,0,true,cc-by,gold

The inclusion of human interaction with digital realities, extended reality (XR) technologies, such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), can play an essential role in Industry 5.0. While rapid advances in XR technologies are solidifying and finding their place in the product and production development process, terminology and classification scheme remain under-determined. As a result, there have been numerous classifications of XR technologies from different perspectives, but little widespread agreement. They have been classified by their level of immersion or how well they meet a specific purpose (such as training). In addition to that, the classifications are usually made for one particular field (e.g. marketing, healthcare, engineering, architecture, among others). Therefore, to set the basis for future research, it is essential to identify and outline the dimensions that intervene in product and production design in regards to XR facilitated collaboration. With the ideas proposed in this paper, we want to identify basic concepts that classify a collaborative XR system by analyzing how users interact with the environment and other users. Our motivation is that collaborative design involves not only the physical dimension but also a social dimension. Defining when an XR system contributes to increasing social and/or physical presence could clarify and simplify its categorization.</jats:p>",,,,,Terminology; Computer science; Product design; Product (mathematics); Knowledge management; Human–computer interaction; Categorization; Data science,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/atde220170,,10.3233/atde220170,,,0,,0,true,,gold

C. Ng; Takayuki Hirose; Hideki Nomoto,"<jats:p>Globalization and mass customization are commonly translated into increased levels of complexity in manufacturing systems. One of the main reasons is the increased number of variables, parameters, and interrelations on the shop floor. This intrinsic complexity can grow exponentially when considering the manufacture of large-size products with high levels of variability and variants: the mass production of large recreational motorboats with high levels of customization and low production volumes, mass customization. With the increasing role of sustainability and concepts of Industry 5.0, focusing not just on improving production systems but also human wellbeing, quick decision making becomes essential. Data and digitalization are becoming the cornerstone for system improvement, and digital data availability and analysis can facilitate the utilization of computerized tools to support decision making and maximize the performance of complex systems. For that purpose, simulation can be a powerful analytical tool to design, maintain, and improve complex manufacturing systems. Simulation techniques usually allow handling the size and complexity commonly associated with manufacturing systems. However, in systems with highly customized and large-size products, manual processes, and limited floor space, the implementation of simulation techniques is not straightforward, especially considering the aspects of variability, data collection, model validation, and system reconfiguration. With a particular focus on large-size products and limitations of a constrained existing facility layout, this paper presents the implementation of a simulation-based reconfiguration assessment considering manual production, assembly, and internal logistics requirements. Going through an industrial case study of large recreational motorboats manufacturing, the paper analyses the system analysis, data collection, implementation, and validation of the methodology step by step. Considering different what-if scenarios, the focus is on the capacity reconfiguration using Discrete-Event Simulation. The results can serve as a guideline for decision-makers and stakeholders working with complex mass customization manufacturing systems and space-constrained facility layouts.</jats:p>",,,,,Mass customization; Control reconfiguration; Computer science; Production (economics); Industrial engineering; Product (mathematics); Personalization; Raw data; Systems engineering; Manufacturing engineering,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/atde220130,,10.3233/atde220130,,,0,,0,true,,gold

Symbiotic relationships of humans and machines have wide potential for human-centric manufacturing (aka Industry 5.0). Moreover, connecting smart devices and deploying self-learning solutions is envisioned to increase flexibility of manufacturing, thus changing work division between humans and machines. Where humans and machines collaborate, the term Reciprocal Learning has been coined to describe the process of bidirectional learning. While a definition of Reciprocal Learning exists the boundary conditions of the concept are still ambiguous. In this paper, a framework for Reciprocal Learning in Human-Machine Collaboration for Industry 5.0 is presented to clarify what it is and what it isn’t. The approach is based on a multi-agent system perspective, comprising human and machine agents. Finally, an outlook on future research is presented.</jats:p>",,,207,225,Flexibility (engineering); Reciprocal; Workforce; Computer science; Industry 4.0; Artificial intelligence; Manufacturing; Knowledge management; Process (computing); Engineering; Human–computer interaction,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.30844/wagb_2022_11,,10.30844/wagb_2022_11,,,0,,0,false,,

Computer Technologies, Automatic Control & Radioelectronics",1991976x; 24096571,FSAEIHE South Ural State University (National Research University),,Elena A. Avdeeva; Tatiana A. Averina; Natalya A. Balashova,"<jats:p>The research objective of the present article is to study new world trends in industrial deve¬lopment and the reaction speed of national governments, companies and workers to technological changes. As research methods, analysis and synthesis of current world trends were applied, as well as special methods were used: expert assessments of international organizations were analyzed, a comparative and economic-statistical analysis was carried out. As a result, the distinctive features of Industry 5.0 are highlighted – this is the coexistence of industry and new social and environmental trends and needs. Change is inevitable: green energy and sustainable products will initially be a monopoly factor and benefit insiders. It is emphasized that in order to achieve global competitiveness, companies need to transform established business models and invest in technology and network forms of business, taking into account social goals: in addition to creating new jobs and ensuring flexible employment, we are talking about personalization of goods and greening. The poli¬tical and economic goals of the fifth industrial revolution and the direction of technological innovations are considered. It is emphasized that technology, according to the new approach, should serve people and society, which means that the technology used in production adapts to the needs and diversity of industry workers. The leaders are artificial intelligence, quantum information and semiconductors. Technological transformation is based on the development of the following areas: individual technologies for human-machine interaction, biotechnology and smart materials, artificial intelligence, digital twins, data transmission, storage and analysis technologies, as well as energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, storage and autonomy. It is an ecosystem-based innovation policy with a flexible focus on results. It is noted that technological transformation will help solve a number of unique social problems. It puts a bold focus from individual technologies to a system approach that allows the industry to achieve social goals beyond job creation and growth, and puts the well-being of industry workers at the center of the production process. In conclusion, the techno-social nature of the fifth revolution is revealed, with technology as tools and social needs as the ultimate goal.</jats:p>",22,2,141,147,Industrial organization; Technological revolution; Diversity (politics); Digital transformation; Business; Technological change; Order (exchange); Sustainable development; Competitive advantage; Big data; Economics; Marketing,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.14529/ctcr220213,,10.14529/ctcr220213,,,0,,0,true,,gold

The framework is designed with six core components, namely spatial data, metadata, standards, electronic clearinghouse, communication network and application specific module. Three-tier thin client server web GIS architecture is adopted for imparting geospatial web capabilities to OpenSDI4Health using QGIS, GeoServer, Apache Tomcat, PostgreSQL/ PostGIS, uDig Java Script, CSS and HTML. Hospital site selection, a typical ill-structured decision-making problem involving multiple criteria and stakeholders, is selected as application module for Prayagraj city of India. For this purpose, web-based Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) with three core components, i.e., database, model base and user interface, is developed. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique, is used for developing the spatial model for criteria selection, criteria weighting and spatial modelling under GIS environment. Open SDI for Health Sector, OpenSDI4Health, is non-proprietary solution powered with interoperability and security features which enables the sharing across different technologies, data, platforms and organizations, thereby providing reliability as well as reusability of the developed framework for other sectors also, like education, for empowering the planners and administrators to make informed decisions leading to the improvement in the efficacy of developmental process.KeywordsWeb GISSpatial Data Infrastructure (SDI)HealthOpen Source Geospatial Resources (OSGR)InteroperableNational Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)Hospital site selectionMulti Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)Client server architectureAnalytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Standards",,,273,303,Spatial data infrastructure; Geospatial analysis; Computer science; Analytic hierarchy process; Interoperability; Spatial database; Multiple-criteria decision analysis; Database; Process management; Knowledge management,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-9476-9_13,,10.1007/978-981-16-9476-9_13,,,0,007-295-931-988-367; 009-881-393-198-900; 011-083-410-259-687; 023-638-509-880-90X; 027-914-291-760-019; 036-784-682-767-502; 059-992-212-549-157; 090-103-019-389-48X; 110-087-545-162-687; 188-589-469-717-897,1,false,,

To enlighten the transition from Industry 4.0 to Society 5.0, and from Engineering Education 4.0 to Engineering Education 5.0, project-based learning (PBL) methodologies should also evolve. In terms of focus and topics selected for the PBL experiences, it is necessary to put forward the relevance of global challenges and to nurture a compromise for sustainability and ethical behaviour, while bringing students as close as possible to real multifaceted engineering problems. As regards connections with other educational methodologies, PBL and service learning (SL) are bound to hybridization and may benefit from innovative approaches, like the use of flipped classrooms, the promotion of gamification or the support of online resources and e-/b-/m-learning tools and methods. Complete PBL experiences will also synergize with and contribute to open-source engineering movements, like the “makers” movement, and will benefit from open software and hardware tools for increased educational equity. This chapter analyses and discusses trends in PBL methodologies, in connection with these new industrial and educational paradigms.</jats:p>",,,,,Transformative learning; Project-based learning; Engineering education; Service-learning; Engineering ethics; Promotion (chess); Engineering; Equity (law); Nature versus nurture; Compromise; Engineering management; Computer science,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.102844,,10.5772/intechopen.102844,,,0,125-795-343-058-314; 136-036-567-993-098,0,true,,hybrid

In the new promoted concept, Industry 5.0, it is expected that humans interact with robots, known as cobots, in a collaborative working space using innovative technologies. This chapter brings some new insights on the way the components of Industry 5.0 readiness model influence value added reported by countries, for the period between 2017 and 2019, on four levels of analysis, namely: (i) country gross value added; (ii) environmental activities value added; (iii) ICT sector value added; (iv) labour productivity. Our results prove that selected components of the Industry 5.0 readiness model determine a positive marginal effect on the value added reported by countries. We also registered a significant influence on the development of the circular economy, in strong relation with the development of the knowledge economy. This highlights the fact that the results of the research are efficiently implemented on manufacturing operations by highly skilled employees, leading to increase firms’ performance, improving at the same time the cooperation between humans and smart machines, as stated in the Industry 5.0 framework.KeywordsHuman-centric approachSustainable developmentIndustry 5.0Economic assessmentResilienceFactor analysisReadiness IndexEnvironmental value addedLabour productivity",,,233,256,Productivity; Value (mathematics); Industrial organization; Added value; Index (typography); Business; Work (physics); Perspective (graphical); Industry 4.0; Economics,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-7365-8_9,,10.1007/978-981-16-7365-8_9,,,0,001-395-188-545-307; 002-398-645-119-451; 005-609-792-919-05X; 007-997-484-072-926; 010-191-791-723-448; 017-415-713-662-955; 017-690-014-022-445; 022-364-586-886-756; 024-845-525-387-208; 030-885-939-483-658; 031-827-047-258-990; 034-191-620-199-646; 044-257-323-155-323; 044-976-542-021-772; 049-816-999-056-296; 065-776-376-781-367; 067-715-932-083-994; 071-973-445-852-166; 079-330-047-262-55X; 080-645-998-976-111; 100-124-216-391-558; 102-024-085-249-950; 103-000-517-608-073; 103-127-499-232-604; 106-174-712-124-858; 140-933-913-297-672; 146-346-698-365-266; 151-367-882-448-620; 152-325-633-965-046; 153-133-342-515-563,2,false,,

And so inherent this Promethean concept lie the concepts of the Schumpeterian creative destruction and also the promise and potential for humanity’s better tomorrows. We live in an era of artificial intelligence–driven as well as viral disruptions that challenge the mind as well as the body. At the same time, the impact of our pursuit of prosperity at any cost on the environment triggers displaced people floods and viral pandemics undermining the standard of living and more importantly the foundations of trust in institutions and in a better tomorrow feeding populist movements and autocratic trends in democracies as well as emboldening dictators.

Carayannis; David F. J. Campbell; Evangelos Grigoroudis,"For an understanding of the concept of the Quadruple and Quintuple Helix Innovation Systems, it is essential to realize that the Quadruple and Quintuple Helices are based on democracy and ecology. This has two implications: (1) the further advancement and evolution of knowledge and innovation are requiring a co-evolution with democracy or knowledge democracy, and (2) ecology, ecological sensitivity, and environmental protection are a necessity for the survival of humanity, but they should also be regarded as drivers for further knowledge production and innovation development. This implies that for an innovation system to be a Quadruple and Quintuple Helix Innovation System, the government and the political system, addressing the innovation system, must be democratic in substance, and not only in form. This indicates how a Quadruple and Quintuple Helix differs from Triple Helix approaches to innovation. Furthermore, within the framework of Quadruple and Quintuple Helix, the “Democracy of Climate” for innovation and the “Democracy of Knowledge” are combined together in creating a nexus. Implications for strategy, policy, and practice are manifold, also incorporating aspects of Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0.",,,1,30,Triple helix; Neoclassical economics; Helix; Nexus (standard); Government; Economics; Political system; Innovation system; Democracy; Entrepreneurship,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-021-00813-x,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-021-00813-x,,,3177023060,,0,000-822-603-173-465; 002-769-430-371-000; 003-623-061-566-332; 006-037-296-021-481; 006-458-937-938-122; 007-971-265-021-699; 008-880-163-041-448; 010-162-760-623-206; 011-878-922-944-695; 012-750-062-281-425; 013-085-946-745-001; 014-396-351-330-266; 014-408-859-245-463; 015-098-569-195-264; 015-365-120-464-050; 015-438-738-495-734; 016-614-622-441-095; 017-371-122-099-089; 017-415-713-662-955; 018-225-989-657-232; 018-282-224-169-000; 019-531-458-043-997; 028-028-892-088-002; 033-944-614-999-433; 034-783-839-685-525; 036-285-006-299-516; 038-655-340-251-727; 038-846-644-231-911; 040-252-352-426-753; 040-778-348-220-273; 041-437-717-635-476; 043-434-429-197-466; 044-385-421-528-476; 045-683-618-122-316; 047-946-263-596-778; 049-514-992-846-857; 051-969-308-907-346; 051-975-164-698-08X; 051-996-378-965-713; 052-750-868-077-299; 056-049-545-647-082; 059-009-932-291-672; 062-223-632-958-151; 064-911-828-088-495; 065-768-850-650-365; 067-256-259-033-371; 067-657-975-259-248; 073-123-784-675-864; 075-639-472-070-33X; 075-742-629-719-738; 076-573-165-380-300; 078-095-766-223-262; 079-243-720-152-380; 079-263-307-315-834; 079-919-116-621-379; 080-889-748-635-876; 086-026-667-468-927; 087-262-281-823-616; 089-187-658-916-00X; 091-928-035-899-634; 093-779-978-973-429; 098-807-165-934-454; 100-549-579-714-540; 102-209-767-634-670; 102-458-672-600-731; 102-861-736-374-631; 105-506-827-634-796; 109-279-999-636-550; 109-778-713-586-989; 110-459-268-431-213; 110-545-874-743-074; 113-724-467-093-61X; 114-423-455-829-244; 116-328-367-735-253; 117-357-964-775-519; 118-879-792-570-641; 119-730-544-716-817; 120-094-718-338-889; 124-068-342-141-899; 125-601-357-301-698; 125-795-343-058-314; 132-333-206-400-256; 133-607-804-091-774; 134-548-748-198-735; 134-588-663-182-60X; 135-038-723-068-121; 135-553-141-898-826; 137-894-769-087-410; 137-990-144-076-885; 138-332-915-687-580; 146-038-040-082-222; 150-661-354-927-688; 155-920-474-732-40X; 158-070-665-594-661; 160-606-043-902-329; 168-732-857-851-354; 170-049-396-285-999; 172-812-948-733-729; 173-118-643-332-904; 175-785-932-198-352; 179-589-522-413-475,0,false,,

The manufacturing industry is currently moving towards the integration of productivity enhancements and sustainable human employment. Such a transformation has deeply changed the human–machine interaction (HMI), among which digital twin (DT) and extended reality (XR) are two cutting-edge technologies. A manufacturing DT offers an opportunity to simulate, monitor, and optimize the machine. In the meantime, XR empowers HMI in the industrial field. This paper presents an XR application framework for DT-based services within a manufacturing context. This work aims to develop a technological framework to improve the efficiency of the XR application development and the usability of the XR-based HMI systems. We first introduce four layers of the framework, including the perception layer with the physical machine and its ROS-based simulation model, the machine communication layer, the network layer containing three kinds of communication middleware, and the Unity-based service layer creating XR-based digital applications. Subsequently, we conduct the responsiveness test for the framework and describe several XR industrial applications for a DT-based smart crane. Finally, we highlight the research challenges and potential issues that should be further addressed by analyzing the performance of the whole framework.</jats:p>",12,12,6030,6030,Industry 4.0; Computer science; Context (archaeology); Digital transformation; Middleware (distributed applications); Application layer; Manufacturing engineering; Engineering; Systems engineering,,,,Business Finland,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app12126030,,10.3390/app12126030,,,0,001-501-694-057-716; 004-085-738-535-206; 004-420-242-506-255; 005-912-139-679-809; 006-892-043-785-704; 009-851-433-625-819; 013-961-199-230-836; 014-206-084-650-088; 017-415-713-662-955; 019-377-897-064-068; 020-250-142-306-281; 021-473-871-108-925; 024-294-681-700-659; 029-369-428-965-288; 032-273-512-707-734; 035-358-475-696-790; 042-139-189-848-822; 046-727-219-981-488; 048-092-008-205-493; 051-794-592-567-825; 052-219-484-209-348; 056-667-310-722-226; 058-724-297-052-90X; 059-424-427-267-469; 061-458-859-607-380; 061-607-719-092-975; 064-138-810-036-202; 065-186-992-988-265; 069-524-132-610-400; 071-234-216-800-144; 079-725-390-592-069; 084-970-472-358-639; 085-360-548-865-679; 095-096-161-740-778; 096-370-400-671-817; 104-963-683-392-202; 109-202-790-784-741; 113-830-545-572-413; 113-990-898-518-052; 119-628-533-980-603; 120-749-568-596-544; 169-612-087-067-722; 181-383-343-326-198; 199-963-221-016-954,1,true,cc-by,gold

Aditia; R.P. Bastari; L. Agung,"Osamu Tezuka is known as a pioneer of modern manga. His works such as Tetsuwan Atom, Black Jack, and Kimba The White Lion have been translated into various languages and have received many prestigious awards in the field of comics. In 1989, Tezuka passed away, leaving a cultural legacy not only for manga but also for the comics world. Phaidon is a manga created under the name of Tezuka and published in 2020. The interesting thing about Paidon is that its creation was done by Artificial Intelligence and staff from Tezuka Pro. This process is relatively new in comics because, generally, comics are made by an artist/group. This research focuses on Paidon as a case study to build a model of how visual idioms are constructed. The method used is the visual analysis by Gillian Rose, which covers aspects of production, image, and audience, where each aspect includes technological, compositional, and social modalities. This study concludes that the preservation of deceased artists required capable human resources to mimic the visual language; the AI took the role of a production apparatus. This might be one production method in the future. However, without the capabilities of human resources, Paidon would not achieve a maximum visual approach.",,,225,229,Comics; Art; Visual arts; White (mutation); Art history; Literature,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9781003263135-45,,10.1201/9781003263135-45,,,0,,0,false,,

A resilient manufacturing strategy based on the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks plays an essential role in facilitating production and supply chain recovery. IIoT contains confidential data and private information, and many security issues arise through vulnerabilities in the infrastructure. The traditional centralized IIoT framework is not only of high cost for system configuration but also vulnerable to cyber-attacks and single-point failure, which is not suitable for achieving the resilient manufacturing vision in Industry 5.0. Recently, researchers are seeking a secure solution of middleware based on blockchain technology integration for decentralized IIoT, which can effectively protect the consistency, integrity, and availability of IIoT data by utilizing the auditing and tamper-proof features of the blockchain. This paper presented a review of secure blockchain middleware for decentralized IIoT towards Industry 5.0. Firstly, the security issues of conventional IIoT solutions and the advantages of blockchain middleware are analyzed. Secondly, an architecture of secure blockchain middleware for decentralized IIoT is proposed. Finally, enabling technologies, challenges, and future directions are reviewed. The innovation of this paper is to study and discuss the distributed blockchain middleware, investigating its ability to eliminate the risk of a single point of failure via a distributed feature in the context of resilient manufacturing in Industry 5.0 and to solve the security issues from traditional centralized IIoT. Also, the four-layer architecture of blockchain middleware presented based on the IIoT application framework is a novel aspect of this review. It is expected that the paper lays a solid foundation for making IIoT blockchain middleware a new venue for Industry 5.0 research.</jats:p>",10,10,858,,,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Fund of Guangdong Province; Natural Science Fund of Guangdong Province; Natural Science Fund of Guangdong Province,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/machines10100858,,10.3390/machines10100858,,,0,000-261-027-537-103; 000-872-274-775-136; 001-025-672-211-909; 001-561-372-119-667; 002-114-422-056-521; 002-906-031-014-709; 003-169-385-977-587; 003-216-340-688-115; 007-553-069-846-19X; 007-943-326-313-110; 008-737-890-599-569; 009-068-005-552-129; 009-232-132-724-44X; 010-339-265-603-049; 013-281-428-291-079; 013-325-592-750-03X; 013-768-322-718-382; 014-448-058-704-128; 014-566-355-592-06X; 014-576-766-124-702; 014-825-574-378-884; 015-218-998-128-071; 016-007-049-512-326; 016-100-817-828-259; 017-394-293-618-324; 019-768-331-540-502; 020-013-299-917-583; 020-530-487-263-965; 021-386-049-291-029; 021-418-156-065-231; 023-133-537-535-501; 024-550-020-211-33X; 024-934-625-349-73X; 025-753-733-708-676; 026-153-304-940-749; 026-534-171-939-646; 028-123-009-840-038; 029-171-255-183-638; 029-381-953-625-267; 029-714-672-913-302; 030-905-864-113-905; 032-500-844-217-691; 034-797-930-862-008; 035-234-337-632-014; 035-234-684-101-98X; 036-132-852-559-789; 036-510-341-898-901; 036-601-600-371-463; 038-895-789-054-515; 040-843-493-429-83X; 040-897-456-290-027; 041-097-380-557-768; 048-758-220-269-775; 052-142-088-397-065; 053-861-123-946-275; 055-342-161-049-071; 057-689-909-095-090; 059-333-593-152-401; 060-317-465-188-456; 060-345-256-979-997; 061-203-150-269-869; 062-614-115-931-397; 064-661-893-399-960; 066-143-370-967-909; 067-459-677-354-645; 067-738-623-411-466; 068-386-989-777-307; 068-907-907-069-034; 070-209-091-447-891; 072-419-424-049-655; 072-587-016-279-817; 073-413-378-211-234; 078-060-382-076-312; 079-962-282-480-456; 087-493-680-373-657; 088-281-655-337-496; 092-564-408-629-605; 096-615-822-223-953; 101-696-242-768-320; 101-996-505-439-153; 103-535-795-864-289; 104-206-873-828-080; 105-055-826-711-737; 105-554-702-157-021; 110-446-885-974-317; 114-116-684-871-032; 115-621-396-169-875; 117-387-081-015-644; 120-111-733-175-565; 121-069-410-268-88X; 121-223-565-842-498; 121-670-906-167-035; 122-406-590-315-532; 124-893-251-163-486; 129-227-139-583-699; 129-770-753-140-155; 134-356-496-514-896; 144-796-391-638-165; 146-032-697-704-412; 147-085-466-685-811; 147-513-850-078-029; 156-790-086-009-432; 158-550-690-868-786; 159-173-902-176-796; 166-495-781-650-37X; 167-092-631-409-345; 174-334-582-241-824; 174-491-947-859-029; 175-122-775-119-632,0,true,cc-by,gold

Fernandes Thomaz; Helena I. N. Bispo,"<jats:p>Over the years, organizations have had to adapt to constant changes in their surroundings. To this end, they began to adopt methodologies such as lean manufacturing and Industry 4.0. Their implementation has increased the competitiveness of organizations. Sustainability is getting much attention, leading to the advent of Industry 5.0, which, unlike Industry 4.0, takes sustainable production into account. Forestry sectors are significant for the Portuguese economy, especially cork. This study examines a company in the cork sector to determine how automation and monetization of new resources could increase efficiency, quality, and safety. A qualitative approach was applied in the study through literature review and participant observation actions to analyze and propose improvements. The study fulfilled the purposes defined, identifying options to improve the production process and increase customer satisfaction and worker safety. </jats:p>",,,101,130,Business; Monetization; Lean manufacturing; Sustainability; Cork; Industry 4.0; Manufacturing; Quality (philosophy); Production (economics); Portuguese; Process management; Customer satisfaction; Automation; Industrial organization; Marketing; Operations management,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/978-1-7998-9715-6.ch006,,10.4018/978-1-7998-9715-6.ch006,,,0,000-252-068-018-428; 004-608-614-621-479; 004-771-471-010-549; 011-575-011-664-790; 015-824-415-780-990; 017-415-713-662-955; 024-066-018-469-986; 024-107-329-267-378; 025-690-411-392-474; 032-560-303-265-425; 039-481-219-001-725; 047-298-068-086-016; 048-794-824-072-488; 049-816-999-056-296; 050-943-488-550-716; 052-577-850-908-051; 062-515-314-267-579; 070-976-964-349-965; 071-352-824-593-764; 076-991-386-599-906; 077-716-206-953-059; 086-108-764-092-000; 086-971-831-944-611; 089-304-271-383-763; 103-179-275-565-930; 108-795-022-531-530; 108-998-660-789-624; 116-163-123-165-642; 138-808-668-276-565; 168-781-364-296-701; 169-747-371-350-822; 180-366-765-984-173,0,false,,

The present industrial wave—Industry 4.0—by using its enabling technologies and principles holds great potential to develop sustainable manufacturing paradigms which require balancing out the three fundamental elements —products, processes, and systems. Yet, numerous stakeholders, including industrial policy and decision makers, remain oblivious of such potential and requirements. Thus, this bibliometric study is aimed at presenting an overview of the broad field of research on the convergence of sustainable manufacturing and Industry 4.0 under the umbrella of “Sustainable Manufacturing 4.0”, which has yet to be developed. It includes the dissemination of original findings on pathways and practices of Industry 4.0 applied to the development of sustainable manufacturing, contributing a bibliometric structure of the literature on the aforementioned convergence to reveal how Industry 4.0 could be used to shift the manufacturing sector to a more sustainable-based state. An initial research agenda for this emerging area has accordingly been presented, which may pave the way for having a futuristic view on Sustainable Manufacturing 5.0 in the next industrial wave, i.e., Industry 5.0.</jats:p>",13,24,13956,13956,Manufacturing; Sustainable development; Business; Field (mathematics); Sustainability; Advanced manufacturing; Industrial organization; Manufacturing engineering; Engineering,,,,University of Technology Malaysia,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132413956,,10.3390/su132413956,,,0,000-154-268-929-69X; 004-112-055-239-935; 004-281-239-042-907; 004-317-549-500-629; 004-412-636-978-087; 004-771-471-010-549; 005-129-164-135-956; 005-648-248-699-892; 006-952-833-525-052; 007-592-719-575-515; 009-146-056-724-526; 010-977-783-106-567; 011-383-825-368-599; 011-575-011-664-790; 015-679-631-932-815; 016-819-194-616-838; 024-386-504-876-926; 024-841-938-591-401; 025-131-859-546-629; 025-253-322-092-116; 026-049-078-551-98X; 026-219-615-660-807; 028-368-253-186-571; 031-540-666-653-73X; 034-344-593-328-178; 036-175-603-962-622; 038-196-787-346-28X; 040-270-893-791-832; 041-437-717-635-476; 045-407-274-782-634; 046-239-928-578-285; 047-707-723-812-745; 048-887-796-847-647; 049-872-293-794-955; 051-735-211-995-456; 053-277-395-582-29X; 059-424-427-267-469; 060-697-636-862-597; 065-407-962-300-016; 065-697-272-243-331; 068-843-345-096-320; 070-047-008-873-090; 072-236-779-686-90X; 072-974-520-873-188; 079-725-390-592-069; 082-092-502-486-561; 087-147-779-068-60X; 090-048-373-299-947; 095-096-161-740-778; 097-206-601-127-115; 098-906-417-385-804; 102-424-326-687-39X; 102-443-972-671-847; 102-861-736-374-631; 107-131-568-310-15X; 108-317-963-192-028; 109-120-948-156-499; 118-108-400-383-703; 118-401-703-686-43X; 119-451-551-173-601; 125-760-277-546-861; 125-972-278-293-709; 126-014-294-266-089; 127-021-195-266-886; 132-434-066-780-80X; 136-831-130-559-080; 138-808-668-276-565; 146-118-783-422-427; 152-146-421-913-400; 156-759-342-367-728; 160-750-127-610-231; 171-625-720-713-000,9,true,cc-by,gold

Moreover, advances in the Digital Era may also foster citizenship development as shown in the next paper; but at the same time represent a challenge regarding professional skills needed in particular for startups that are growing rapidly in number and size everywhere; so this is context of the next paper. Next paper is a study on the Quality of Life at work based on Leadership Models that in particular shows the positive impacts of a more Participatory Leadership. Next paper shows, through a survey of 396 companies in Brazil, that only a small number of organizations deal with the process of retaining professionals identified as potential successors that no doubt could be very relevant for the organization. Regarding Human Resources next paper is a study based on a Semantic Analysis about possibilities that are opening already, at the recruitment and selection process, by using Artificial Intelligence. Next paper seeks to find relationships between motivation and engagement and project management by means of a bibliometric analysis. For this purpose, was performed a cluster analysis of 529 articles using VOXviewer indicated that motivation in projects is strongly linked to professional development and growth, with increased interest in sustainability and in the relationship with stakeholders represented by the internal and external community of projects; and regarding Organizational Culture next paper shows, through a survey of 109 Organizations in Brazil, the importance of integrating Cultural Diversity in Organizations that may not only help to improve social conditions but also lead to recruiting better talents and leads to greater customer orientation, greater employee satisfaction and better decision making representing a win-win strategy. Still regarding Organizational Culture, and based on Quinn and Rohrbaugh’s model, next paper focus impacts on Competitive Strategy in the Banking Segment following Quinn and McGrath approach. Next paper is a statistical study regarding Fidelity in the Physical Fitness Business, using Logistic Regression and unidirectional ANOVA, that surprisingly show that frequency of use was the most relevant variable related to customer retention, rather than price and membership length. Today’s economic impacts of COVID-!9 is leading Public Policies in Governments like Brazil to drastically reduce Investments in Science and Technology that may end up decreasing the Human Development Index – HDI, as shown by next paper based on a previous study of the performance indicators in Science, Technology and Innovation CT&amp;I in 14 countries including some like Brazil. Today, 55% of the world's population lives in urban areas, a proportion that is expected to increase to 68% by 2050; as a matter of fact by 2050, two-thirds of all humanity will live in urban areas; and higher changes have actually been in Latin America and the Caribbean with 81.2% of the population already living in urban areas, up from 41.3% in 1950. Hence particularly in these regions sustainable development will become fundamental for the management of cities, so next paper dealing with a small city in southern Brazil may be helping as Best Practice Case. The city was able, through Team Works, to developed a Municipal Goals Plan based on the Sustainable Development Goals - SDG and in less than 4 years (2017-2020) 90% of which were reached through Work Teams driven basically by: The engagement of those responsible for2RISUS – Journal on Innovation and Sustainability, São Paulo, v. 12, n.2, p. 1-3, abr./mai. 2021 - ISSN 2179-3565Administrative Management, The importance of planning, at both strategic and operational levels, and the commitment of the teams in the execution of the actions. Actually, Brazil for some time has being already counting with an Open Sustainable Cities Program that help cities to develop its own strategies accordingly. Next paper is a survey of 48 companies in Brazil that using Crunchbase and Iramuteq technologies found three classes of business blockchain impact on Business models: A distributed value structure, a governance structure and an application structure aimed at encrypted and tokens. Next paper coming from Ukraine shows an approach for modelling a System of Balanced Criteria of Business Process Management (BPM), focused on large data volumes with a basic processes implemented using the cloud computing service — math.semestr, that may be promising in terms of automation of business process management. Last paper comes from Malaysia and deals with a trial on Home Buyers´ Willingness to Pay (WTP), using an on-line survey constructed using the LMA design tool provided in the ‘support.CEs’ package that showed that even a small and diversified sample of 20 respondents dealing with home buyer preferences for sustainable housing and analyzed using the package’s clogit function may give some results even for the measurement of a higher number of variables.</jats:p>",12,2,1,3,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.23925/2179-3565.2021v12i2p1-3,,10.23925/2179-3565.2021v12i2p1-3,,,0,,0,true,cc-by,gold

However, changes caused by introduction of modern technologies, and increasing complexity of products and production, directly affect the industrial enterprises and workers. The critics of the Industry 4.0 paradigm emphasized its orientation to new technologies and digitalization in a technocratic way. Therefore, the new industrial paradigm Industry 5.0 appeared very soon and automatically triggered a debate about the role of, and reasons for applying, the new paradigm. Industry 5.0 is complementing the existing Industry 4.0 paradigm with the orientation to the worker who has an important role in the production process, and that role has been emphasized during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this research, there is a brief discussion on main drivers and enablers for introduction of these new paradigms, then a literature-based analysis is carried out to highlight the differences between two paradigms from three important aspects—people, organization, and technology. The conclusion emphasizes the main features and concerns regarding the movement towards Industry 5.0, and the general conclusion is that there is a significant change of the main research aims from sustainability towards human-centricity. At the end, the analysis of maturity models that evaluates enterprises’ readiness to introduce features of new paradigms is given as well.</jats:p>",15,14,5221,5221,Technocracy; Paradigm shift; Industry 4.0; Maturity (psychological); Process (computing); Sustainability; Production (economics); Business; Knowledge management; Process management,,,,"Ministry of Science and Education, Croatia",,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15145221,,10.3390/en15145221,,,0,001-105-017-327-374; 002-461-958-640-220; 004-897-635-729-60X; 005-055-870-778-554; 005-481-275-314-757; 005-515-885-541-95X; 005-893-318-241-334; 013-062-332-770-50X; 013-287-665-466-861; 016-130-734-226-866; 016-693-057-650-297; 017-415-713-662-955; 018-162-499-417-652; 021-885-276-713-312; 022-749-428-410-637; 023-095-169-240-261; 023-122-597-329-001; 025-835-887-610-080; 026-930-195-193-249; 029-434-241-679-095; 030-175-057-256-924; 032-034-682-821-128; 032-369-782-027-735; 033-417-989-281-714; 033-851-018-944-660; 036-652-321-315-178; 036-654-575-461-182; 036-773-865-080-080; 037-277-785-325-862; 037-508-704-688-473; 038-904-037-813-023; 038-934-549-983-322; 039-809-166-788-304; 039-963-766-313-965; 041-266-949-737-670; 041-668-696-572-32X; 042-361-052-976-441; 046-204-457-609-523; 048-792-616-397-035; 049-770-724-709-891; 049-816-999-056-296; 050-089-676-804-867; 050-718-984-702-853; 050-997-950-548-215; 052-905-937-357-90X; 053-151-992-721-389; 054-244-545-950-971; 055-824-854-848-687; 058-439-132-526-924; 060-377-599-476-36X; 062-710-877-541-774; 064-138-810-036-202; 064-613-815-780-372; 066-181-830-062-455; 068-253-847-007-674; 068-411-220-493-390; 069-554-604-744-712; 069-884-471-095-350; 074-389-603-385-644; 074-626-579-509-462; 074-895-567-621-479; 077-145-887-124-435; 079-136-824-115-839; 079-532-899-441-414; 082-484-089-677-614; 084-249-962-919-116; 091-537-895-423-291; 091-664-230-499-576; 091-928-035-899-634; 092-312-692-707-971; 102-424-326-687-39X; 103-012-161-375-712; 111-757-006-806-339; 113-830-545-572-413; 114-959-616-531-867; 116-930-904-782-963; 117-448-868-055-267; 117-664-768-562-065; 122-400-343-286-458; 122-450-929-848-353; 123-003-416-766-610; 123-965-082-287-501; 125-182-330-368-258; 129-216-204-340-711; 130-580-140-904-843; 135-553-141-898-826; 137-128-079-291-155; 138-121-055-960-195; 138-741-782-102-653; 140-944-446-493-589; 150-233-135-089-265; 154-098-550-548-971; 155-976-832-034-795; 165-778-127-427-88X; 166-487-315-129-026; 170-749-186-025-782; 180-734-182-083-978; 188-345-974-957-591,0,true,cc-by,gold

The result of research showed that Quizizz is more preferable to Kahoot! to the participants because in Quizizz question and answer appear on cell phone/laptop screen of individual participants so that they should not see the screen before the class just like that in Kahoot!; the answer in Kahoot! constitutes symbols while in Quizizz the real answer constitutes word, number, or figure; after the quiz has been completed, the questions answered can be checked in order to find out the ones answered incorrectly and mastered poorly by the participants.Corresponding author:AgusSuharsonoDOI: 10.24071/ijiet.2020.040215</jats:p>",4,2,332,342,Laptop; Gadget; Documentation; Note-taking; Mathematics education; Computer science; Multimedia; Psychology,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/327692598.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.24071/ijiet.v4i2.2399,,10.24071/ijiet.v4i2.2399,,,0,,1,true,,gold

Individuals, companies, and supply chains face challenges emerging from economic, sociological, and political phenomena. These phenomena disrupt regular performance and limit the efficient functioning of companies and economies. Due to numerous relations and connections in the economy, disruptions in one area affect the others and spread, growing in range and severity. Hence, disruptions should be dealt with to provide continuity of supply chains and to ensure their efficient and effective performance. The study aims to identify crucial characteristics of disruptions to facilitate disruption minimization strategies. The characteristics of disruptions in supply chains are identified based on a literature review, synthesized and validated by the experts. A study is implemented to validate identified characteristics and to confront theoretical findings with the practical experience and observations of the experts. The results of the study are discussed and commented on. The conclusions from the study refer to the nature and characteristics of disruptions in the contemporary economy, equipping managers with useful knowledge when dealing with disruptions, and academics with observations that can stimulate further discussion on stability, flexibility, and resilience of companies and supply chains.</jats:p>",15,13,4579,4579,Supply chain; Flexibility (engineering); Resilience (materials science); Business; Psychological resilience; Geopolitics; Industrial organization; Emerging markets; Risk analysis (engineering); Economic system,,,,Poznań University of Technology,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15134579,,10.3390/en15134579,,,0,002-808-413-983-549; 003-837-661-819-384; 005-929-467-959-843; 007-022-995-409-922; 010-239-201-980-736; 011-256-657-003-280; 016-205-652-115-031; 019-762-945-371-929; 022-724-590-714-654; 026-537-026-083-013; 037-830-455-620-78X; 037-945-118-531-575; 038-646-774-263-958; 041-290-978-117-294; 042-235-824-984-197; 053-915-729-491-288; 055-288-223-917-15X; 058-905-175-880-988; 070-328-959-620-604; 085-267-822-728-575; 085-531-697-099-430; 088-618-199-729-410; 098-531-705-893-880; 100-124-216-391-558; 114-219-695-582-035; 123-096-849-447-602; 131-527-044-332-48X; 137-422-360-565-821; 141-331-639-170-377; 168-374-894-057-574,0,true,cc-by,gold

Then in this follow-up research will implement natural fiber materials to home living textile products targeting the community as a target market that adopt the “Back to Nature” lifestyle. The movement to implement materials made from natural fibers, which can be called sustainable fashion, is increasingly echoed in Indonesian society, its practice is expected to fulfill several points in The Sustainable Development Goals by United Nations especially responsible consumption and production. At that moment, it was seen that there was an opportunity for this home living product to be useful for various things in everyday life. So the use of materials that are in accordance with the character of the target market is very necessary. This study uses a qualitative method with a business opportunity planning approach, which is considered to be one of the innovations that have the opportunity to be developed in the business realm and increase the creative industry in Indonesia.",,,134,138,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9781003263135-27,,10.1201/9781003263135-27,,,0,,0,false,,

Although the notion of DX has garnered much research interest from practitioners, scholarship on this topic is somehow lagging behind, possibly because of the lack of theoretical frameworks on DX. Recently, most Japanese firms have begun to use diverse digital technologies to sustain their competitive advantages. However, the return of investment on digital technologies has not been as high as expected for some firms. Furthermore, as the visions of Industry 5.0 describe sustainable, resilient, and human-centered future factories that will require smart and resilient capabilities both from next-generation manufacturing systems and human operators, it is necessary to design resilient human–machine collaborations within factories. To this end, this paper presents a research model between DX technologies and scientific problem-solving in terms of deduction, induction, and abduction inference structures as an approach to resilient human–machine collaborations. The purpose of this research is to analyze the difference in the utilization pattern of the digital technology of American, German, and Japanese firms based on three types of decision-making methods. Next, we apply this framework in a comparative case study of two Japanese firms and one German firm, where we find that there is a difference in DX technologies utilization among the Japanese and German firms. We assert that the utilization of IoT technology in the United States and Germany is pursuing IoT with the aim of autonomous control, whereas Japanese firms prioritize robot–human collaboration. Finally, we discuss how our findings contribute to the burgeoning field of resilient human–machine collaborations by showing the distinct roles of deduction, induction, and abduction inference structures. Furthermore, our research contributes to international comparative studies to identify the difference in national IT utilization. Lessons and implications are discussed.</jats:p>",14,17,10583,10583,Lagging; Digital transformation; German; Pace; Industrial organization; Vision; Industry 4.0; Business; Computer science; Marketing,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su141710583,,10.3390/su141710583,,,0,002-085-045-445-344; 003-399-150-768-506; 006-947-132-272-228; 007-157-342-877-831; 009-851-433-625-819; 012-218-887-216-344; 022-613-542-030-336; 023-790-190-496-186; 025-838-880-494-316; 031-235-778-832-782; 036-555-670-584-005; 041-406-317-756-787; 053-089-404-364-449; 056-485-524-375-867; 061-012-983-689-452; 063-390-375-334-464; 067-050-661-116-219; 068-833-488-459-388; 081-596-379-437-686; 087-501-199-643-670; 088-321-242-569-049; 102-113-825-126-978; 102-226-089-425-46X; 115-232-897-230-33X; 143-724-850-069-880; 146-473-356-444-943; 148-879-759-455-156; 157-213-706-957-756; 171-092-306-725-218,0,true,cc-by,gold

The proposal of Industry 5.0 begins to take the coordinated development between human and various production factors as one of the key points of corporate sustainable management. Therefore, this paper studies the optimization of medical enterprise’s operations management considering enterprise CSR under Industry 5.0. A mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is developed to maximize the CSR with the consideration of the impact of precision medical technologies such as surgical robots (SRs) and 3D bone printing on employee social welfare, corporate profits, social environment, and customer surplus value. An improved variable neighborhood tabu search (IVNTS) algorithm which combines the variable neighborhood tabu search (VNTS) algorithm and simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is designed to solve the model, and numerical experiments are analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed IVNTS. The research aids medical enterprise to make reasonable operations management decisions, while providing a reference for the government to draft and implement related policies, thereby achieving sustainable social development.",2021,,1,13,Tabu search; Corporate social responsibility; Business; Factors of production; Social change; Operations management; Sustainable management; Surplus value; Social Welfare; Sustainable development,,,,,http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/ddns/2021/9298166.pdf https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ddns/2021/9298166/ https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/ddns/2021/9298166.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/9298166,,10.1155/2021/9298166,3216115205,,0,001-687-255-811-48X; 002-442-051-235-178; 003-438-797-729-70X; 006-580-926-772-103; 008-271-422-618-915; 011-590-725-189-894; 013-961-011-706-573; 017-415-713-662-955; 017-886-901-495-737; 019-756-946-895-926; 028-232-581-949-707; 031-734-786-091-933; 042-322-531-695-119; 047-030-655-106-395; 051-562-393-489-956; 055-429-050-424-977; 067-541-706-328-482; 069-847-586-042-328; 070-991-282-066-330; 074-950-423-617-47X; 077-630-209-634-750; 081-048-404-493-587; 082-012-359-666-400; 085-548-632-889-328; 085-767-488-079-792; 087-350-748-759-364; 102-005-091-011-857; 102-351-910-053-869; 104-233-043-063-940; 109-924-917-934-968; 117-430-718-703-50X; 125-795-343-058-314; 149-281-974-191-894; 166-204-621-970-742,1,true,cc-by,gold

Currently, there is a need to consider sustainable development and the crucial role of man in the assumptions of industry’s future development. Concerns about the implementation of the fourth industrial revolution’s technology became the basis for building the assumptions of Industry 5.0. The article aims to identify the social and economic expectations of the development of the fourth industrial revolution in the context of the development of the sustainability, humanization, and resilience of Industry 4.0. The article presents the results of research obtained based on a critical analysis of the literature and surveys conducted among representatives of Polish society. As a result of the research, key social expectations as to the directions of development of the Industry 4.0 concept were identified. Recommendations for industry development focused on three areas of development—human-centric, sustainable, and resilient—were established.
