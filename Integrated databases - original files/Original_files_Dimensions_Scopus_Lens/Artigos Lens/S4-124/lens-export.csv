M. Protalinsky; A. U. Shvedov; Anna A. Khanova,"The issue of equipment lifecycle management is considered—implementation of the program of maintenance and repair, capital replacement of equipment. During the life cycle of electrical grid equipment, it is possible to identify a period in which the total cost of repairing the equipment in the future will exceed its capital replacement with new equipment with similar indicators. The materials of domestic and foreign authors were studied on the topic of the operation of the power grid equipment park, regulatory and reference information for distribution power grid companies. Calculated functions are derived based on the economic indicators of the equipment - the cost of repairs, the book value, the level of inflation, taking into account the operation of the equipment. According to the task, a decision-making agent was developed for managing the life cycle of equipment of power grid companies based on economic indicators. The implementation of this algorithm in the production asset management system of interregional distribution grid companies will optimize the life cycle costs of a piece of equipment. The calculations made based on the decision-making algorithm in managing the life cycle of the equipment of power grid companies based on economic indicators indicate a decrease in the total cost of equipment by up to 10%. Investing the freed-up capital will allow the existing high-quality characteristics of the power grid equipment fleet.KeywordsStatus indexGrid equipmentMaintenanceRepairReplacement functionLife cycle",,,177,187,Grid; Capital equipment; Engineering; Capital cost; Control (management); Asset (computer security); Reliability engineering; Product life-cycle management; Operations management,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-95112-2_15,,10.1007/978-3-030-95112-2_15,,,0,001-787-961-183-044; 004-758-793-938-386; 006-777-001-978-416; 012-008-900-078-543; 018-115-954-828-700; 023-259-571-977-42X; 028-232-122-518-537; 033-541-372-628-755; 035-698-629-532-299; 046-048-155-408-791; 049-095-829-626-316; 076-134-267-838-218; 080-121-200-998-016; 094-440-788-411-867; 102-824-531-484-519,0,false,,

Under this paper I have highlighted the pros and cons in favour and those oppose to the practice. The practitioners argued for its continuation because it was an important cultural heritage that marks the transition of a girl from childhood to adulthood while the abolitionists wanted it to be abolished because it violates human rights. I have adopted a doctrinal method of research under this paper to look into the veracity of the arguments of both sides. The prevailing opinion is that FGM or female circumcision violated both constitutionally guaranteed rights like rights to life, health, physical integrity, dignity, etc and human rights treaties and Conventions like United Nations Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Covenant on Civil and Political rights, the Maputo Protocol, etc. in view of this the practice should be abolished.      Keywords: Female, Genital, Mutilation, Circumcision, Cutting, Women’s Right.

Future factory floor workers will work in teams that include both human co-workers and smart machine actors. The visions of Industry 5.0 describe sustainable, resilient, and human-centered future factories that will require smart and resilient capabilities both from next-generation manufacturing systems and human operators. What kinds of approaches can help design these kinds of resilient human–machine teams and collaborations within them? In this paper, we analyze this design challenge, and we propose basing the design on the joint cognitive systems approach. The established joint cognitive systems approach can be complemented with approaches that support human centricity in the early phases of design, as well as in the development of continuously co-evolving human–machine teams. We propose approaches to observing and analyzing the collaboration in human–machine teams, developing the concept of operations with relevant stakeholders, and including ethical aspects in the design and development. We base our work on the joint cognitive systems approach and propose complementary approaches and methods, namely: actor–network theory, the concept of operations and ethically aware design.

Nikitina; Irina M. Chernukha,"Mathematization of research is one of the most effective methods of virtual substantiation of foodstuff recipe and technology. This approach allows creating a product that meets consumer's individual needs, i.e. personalized foodstuff (ethnicity, cultural preferences, regional and environmental characteristics, lifestyle), and at the same time reducing the time and cost of decision-making. The article discusses the hypothesis that the “digital twin” of a food product is a virtual model of the product, namely its mathematical model (simulation model). A simulation model is a logical and mathematical description of a food product that is used to conduct a computerized experiment in order to design desired characteristics and properties. The “digital twin” combines all variety of factors from chemical composition, functional and technological properties to organoleptic indicators. The application of the “digital twin” model of the foodstuff will allow: (1) reacting quickly to changes in the composition, properties and types of raw ingredients, (2) adjusting the product recipe in response to changes in consumer preferences, (3) designing products with a given chemical composition, nutritional value and functional orientation, (4) creating functional, specialized products taking into account the metabolism of nutrients (ethnicity, cultural preferences, health status and clinical factors). Products adapted to the needs of small categories of people will help reducing the risks for those who already have diseases, and will meet the needs of those who would like to make their diet more appropriate to individual needs. The proposed approach to creating a model of the “digital twin” of the foodstuff includes several stages. The first stage involves optimization of the nutritional and biological value of the designed product. The second stage is related to designing the food product’s structural forms. But even if the recipe of a food product is optimally selected in the first stage, it does not guarantee its transformation during processing into a stable system with the required structural, mechanical, functional and technological parameters. Evaluation of the developed food product’s efficiency is possible only by analysing numerous and various parameters and indicators. It is convenient to generalize (convolute) many parameters and indicators into a single quantitative dimensionless indicator. To assess the quality and adequacy of the food product, it is suggested to use an integral indicator in the form of additive convolution – the ‘functional’ of the food product quality.",14,,264,270,Risk analysis (engineering); Product (category theory); Variety (cybernetics); Logical conjunction; Order (business); Recipe; Quality (business); Stable system; Personalized nutrition; Computer science,,,,,https://potravinarstvo.com/journal1/index.php/potravinarstvo/article/download/1312/1311 https://www.potravinarstvo.com/journal1/index.php/potravinarstvo/article/view/1312 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/327251658.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5219/1312,,10.5219/1312,3024914629,,0,010-801-068-494-362; 021-343-117-107-976; 043-231-504-847-933; 046-411-199-302-220; 047-330-359-539-078; 057-043-052-229-607; 077-091-580-923-813; 077-940-224-318-661; 078-551-573-944-561; 083-197-057-555-879; 095-637-572-938-905; 104-963-683-392-202; 152-664-153-882-037,2,true,cc-by,gold

As an example, we looked at the resource-sharing problem typical of economic activities and assumed the distribution of individual actions to define the (1) norm function fostered through mutual comparison of value/action ratio based on the equity theory (progressive tax-like), (2) norm function proportional to resource utilization (proportional tax-like) and (3) fixed norm function independent of resource utilization (fixed tax-like). By carrying out numerical simulation, we showed that the progressive tax-like norm function (i) does not increase disparity for the distribution of the actions, unlike the other norm functions, and (ii) has high resource productivity and low Gini coefficient. Therefore the progressive tax-like norm function has the highest sustainability and fairness.",7,3,96,114,Norm (social); Mathematical optimization; Gini coefficient; Decision-making models; Mutual recognition; Resource utilization; Mathematics; Equity theory; Sustainability; Resource productivity,,,,,https://redfame.com/journal/index.php/aef/article/view/4825 https://redfame.com/journal/index.php/aef/article/download/4825/4986 https://ideas.repec.org/a/rfa/aefjnl/v7y2020i3p96-114.html https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/322535333.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.11114/aef.v7i3.4825,,10.11114/aef.v7i3.4825,3105356719; 3007379660,,0,004-545-338-240-85X; 007-191-349-791-474; 007-437-980-745-880; 010-332-589-194-999; 011-882-911-145-929; 012-962-885-974-665; 045-212-803-345-983; 054-065-378-815-209; 062-735-979-667-571; 063-725-226-097-989; 063-862-591-134-240; 070-733-823-215-158; 073-933-963-335-712; 078-341-709-997-73X; 078-362-374-834-789; 081-050-134-994-930; 086-205-801-972-088; 095-975-856-131-048; 096-623-595-192-834; 109-991-058-110-214; 124-784-188-982-725; 152-126-041-220-508; 156-193-184-347-069; 156-765-044-924-988; 159-419-280-815-190; 175-602-270-496-697,3,true,cc-by,gold

Karo Karo; Vena Pricilia; Natasha Setiadinata,"<jats:p>AbstractBlock-chain technology has been utilized in various countries in the world, specifically in Indonesia. Block-chain brings positive impact on the development of businesses in Indonesia, but it also has negative impacts if the government of Indonesia doesn�t keep an eye on it. The Positive impacts are that block-chain can improve the efficiency of time and transactions fee. But on the other hand, block-chain gives opportunity to the beginning of cybercrime, for example data theft, client�s financial data. The formulation of problems are: 1. What is the urgency of the establishment of law concerning block-chain technology utilization in Indonesia based on the perspective of dignified justice; 2. What kind of legal protection should be established concerning consumer and business founder protection on the utilization block-chain technology. This research method is a normative empirical method conducted the way of analyzing norms, the laws and regulation on regarding the topic and with profound interviews with experts/officials who has decent knowledge in this specific area. The purpose of this research is to analyze the consumer and founder protection related on the usage of block-chain and to give an input to the ministry on the urgency of the formation of the law on blockchain in Indonesia. The results of this study are that the blockchain technology has been used in various businesses, such as financial / banking sector, agriculture, etc. Blockchain technology can change the paradigm in the financial sector from a centralized system to a decentralized system and to improve system security. Blockchain must be monitored because the blockchain system contained data privacy, financial privacy to prevent the criminal acts. The conclusion is that the supervision of the blockchain system is carried out by forming special regulations on the blockchain or adding new norms which are based on the dignified justice about blockchain in Bank Indonesia Regulations or Financial Services Authority Regulations related to financial technology.Keywords: Blockchain, Consumers Protection, Money Laundering, Renewal Law, Justice Dignity (Keadilan Bermartabat)Urgensi Pembentukan Peraturan Perundang-Undangan Terkait Teknologi Blockchain di Indonesia berdasarkan Keadilan BermartabatAbstrakTeknologi blockchain telah banyak dimanfaatkan di berbagai negara di dunia, khususnya di Indonesia. Penggunaan blockchain membawa dampak positif bagi pengembangan dunia bisnis di Indonesia, namun juga memiliki dampak negatif jika tidak diawasi oleh baik oleh Pemerintah Indonesia. Dampak positif penggunaan blockchain dapat meningkatkan efisiensi waktu, biaya lalu lintas transaksi keuangan. Namun disatu sisi, blockchain menimbulkan dampak negatif yakni membuka peluang munculnya kejahatan dunia maya (cybercrime) misalnya pencurian data privasi, data keuangan nasabah. Adapun yang menjadi rumusan masalah adalah: 1. Apakah yang menjadi urgensi pembentukan peraturan perundang-undangan terkait manfaat teknologi blockchain di Indonesia berdasarkan perspektif keadilan yang bermartabat; 2. Apa jenis perlindungan hukum yang perlu dibangun tentang perlindungan konsumer dan pelaku usaha dalam penggunaan teknologi block chain. Metode yang digunakan ialah normatif empiris yang dilakukan dengan cara menganalisis norma, peraturan perundang-undangan terhadap topik yang diangkat dan dengan metode wawancara yang mendalam kepada narasumber/pejabat yang memiliki kompetensi di bidang tersebut. Tujuan penelitian untuk menganalisis perlindungan konsumen &amp; pelaku usaha terkait penggunaan blockchain dan untuk memberi masukan bagi Kementerian terkait tentang urgensi pembentukan peraturan penggunaan blockchain di Indonesia. Hasil penelitian ini adalah teknologi blockchain telah dipergunakan di pelbagai usaha, baik di sektor keuangan/perbankan, pertanian dan lain sebagainya. Teknologi blockchain dapat merubah paradigma di sektor keuangan dari sistem sentralisasi menuju sistem desentralisasi dan untuk meningkatkan keamanan sistem. Blockchain wajib diawasi karena di dalam sistem blockchain terdapat privasi data, privasi keuangan dan agar tidak disalahgunakan untuk melakukan tindak pidana. Kesimpulannya adalah pengawasan sistem blockchain dilaksanakan dengan membentuk peraturan khusus tentang blockchain atau menambahkan norma baru yang berprinsipkan keadilan bermartabat tentang blockchain dalam Peraturan Bank Indonesia ataupun Peraturan Otoritas Jasa Keuangan yang terkait teknologi finansial.�Kata Kunci: Blockchain, Perlindungan Konsumen, Pencucian Uang, Pembaharuan Hukum, Keadilan Bermartabat</jats:p>",6,2,177,198,Economic Justice; Chain (algebraic topology); Political science; Law; Perspective (graphical); Block (telecommunications),,,,,https://journal.uniku.ac.id/index.php/unifikasi/article/view/1827 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/295436517.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.25134/unifikasi.v6i2.1827,,10.25134/unifikasi.v6i2.1827,2996937637,,0,043-294-932-561-489; 064-004-412-855-655,0,true,cc-by,gold

However, little has been done to understand how this ill-defined phenomenon may deliver its indented sustainability values despite these speculative promises. To address this knowledge gap, the present study developed a strategy roadmap that explains the mechanism by which Industry 5.0 delivers its intended sustainable development functions. The study first developed and introduced the Industry 5.0 reference model that describes the technical and functional properties of this phenomenon. The study further conducted a content-centric synthesis of the literature and identified the sustainable development functions of Industry 5.0. Next, the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique was employed to identify the sequential relationships among the functions and construct the Industry 5.0-enabled model of sustainable development. The ISM involved collecting the opinions of 11 Industry 5.0 experts through expert panel meetings. Results revealed that Industry 5.0 delivers sustainable development values through 16 functions. Circular intelligent products, employee technical assistance, intelligent automation, open sustainable innovation, renewable integration, and supply chain adaptability are examples of the functions identified. These functions are highly interrelated and should be developed in a specific order so that the synergies and complementarities among them would maximize the sustainable development value gains. The roadmap to Industry 5.0-driven sustainability developed in this study is expected to provide a better understanding of ways Industry 5.0 can contribute to sustainable development, explaining how the development of its functions should be managed to maximize their synergies and contribution to the intended sustainability values. The study also highlights important avenues for future research, emphasizing the potential enablers of Industry 5.0 development, such as Government 5.0 or Corporate Governance 5.0.",33,,716,737,Sustainability; Sustainable development; Adaptability; Business; Industry 4.0; Supply chain; Industrial organization; Process management; Knowledge management; Engineering; Management science,,,,Horizon 2020; European Commission,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2022.08.003,,10.1016/j.spc.2022.08.003,,,0,003-739-483-177-307; 004-345-655-576-30X; 006-649-350-429-398; 009-851-433-625-819; 014-792-234-289-828; 014-934-290-898-725; 017-169-491-519-916; 017-415-713-662-955; 017-829-170-770-895; 023-807-371-911-412; 025-063-158-908-103; 025-485-766-400-282; 026-118-385-750-651; 027-519-650-344-683; 029-434-241-679-095; 033-851-018-944-660; 040-659-213-429-991; 042-568-416-652-13X; 047-735-862-933-748; 048-092-008-205-493; 064-138-810-036-202; 067-215-875-080-779; 070-609-833-244-587; 071-881-107-064-417; 072-759-433-132-777; 076-588-439-491-879; 078-273-948-762-696; 080-621-339-793-673; 085-402-064-678-597; 086-200-251-461-001; 090-332-878-930-771; 095-372-463-753-986; 098-221-028-633-307; 098-319-766-113-317; 104-407-152-275-456; 113-830-545-572-413; 115-035-917-580-95X; 115-664-965-881-484; 125-795-343-058-314; 136-239-393-075-894; 137-395-216-182-331; 138-332-915-687-580; 140-109-678-513-738; 142-998-026-914-988; 148-631-753-420-295; 152-707-246-845-89X; 153-662-522-509-72X; 169-612-087-067-722; 173-852-448-163-988; 190-742-604-017-384,1,true,,hybrid

Such collaborations are deeply anchored in the vision of Society 5.0, which promotes a human-centered society that integrates virtual and physical real spaces to resolve social problems, and Industry 5.0, which promotes intelligent manufacturing processes through collaboration between humans and cyber-physical systems. It is expected that real-time H2M/R collaborations will drive new technologies that facilitate the low-latency exchange of control signals and haptic feedback between humans and machines/robots. The low-latency constraints for real-time interaction will, however, place limits on deployable distance and the flexibility of adding new machines/robots to the system. The scalability of H2M/R collaborations across large geographical distances that also allow rapid onboarding of new machines/robots is therefore an open challenge. This article focuses on global-local AI coordinated learning (GLAD), a solution framework that supports the dynamic addition of new machines/robots and their rapid onboarding. The GLAD framework is based on learning the traffic characteristics and correlation of supported robots/machines at the local edge and global cloud. Harnessing data samples from a real H2M/R application for training and validation, GLAD enables human operators to remotely control machines/robots over extended distances through accurately forecasting their haptic feedback. By globally coordinating and sharing this learning across the network, up to 72 percent of the time can be saved when onboarding new machines/robots.",36,2,124,130,Robot; Computer science; Scalability; Artificial intelligence; Human–computer interaction; Haptic technology,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/mnet.003.2100602,,10.1109/mnet.003.2100602,,,0,010-082-817-180-371; 017-415-713-662-955; 023-626-432-014-836; 023-859-386-843-111; 026-369-100-651-075; 064-396-419-566-309; 070-861-982-357-096; 099-025-960-684-052; 155-270-091-495-601,0,false,,

Both professional and sharia accountants need a pattern of self-management on the basic functions of sharia accounting which will, in turn, increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their work and the results can be shown in real-time. Implication - Research implication shows that some companies have developed this because of the support gained from the adequate standardization of financial management processes and standardization information systems architecture and by the demands of the fourth-generation industry proving that crucial competencies are needed for sharia accountants of zakat and waqf. Originality - The research shows that Islamic accountants must understand Indonesian Financial Accounting Standard 109 on Zakat, Infaq and Sadaqah, and Indonesian Financial Accounting Standard 112 on Waqf which is based on information technology in the era of Industrial Revolution 4.0 and Society Era 5.0.",2,2,229,258,Information technology; Accounting; Business; Sharia; Standardization; Originality; Waqf; Islam; Financial management; Financial accounting,,,,,https://journal.walisongo.ac.id/index.php/jiafr/article/download/6295/pdf https://journal.walisongo.ac.id/index.php/jiafr/article/view/6295,http://dx.doi.org/10.21580/jiafr.2020.2.2.6295,,10.21580/jiafr.2020.2.2.6295,3112207663,,0,005-238-300-959-320; 007-954-500-156-848; 008-575-831-897-751; 009-587-310-090-80X; 010-706-807-782-777; 013-943-615-654-146; 015-712-455-889-601; 017-476-171-384-901; 019-212-964-677-329; 024-746-774-007-962; 025-213-118-843-81X; 028-709-578-541-773; 033-912-197-005-197; 034-920-122-025-384; 036-069-305-940-549; 053-388-488-564-068; 053-807-257-256-66X; 060-458-819-234-181; 064-562-314-361-703; 071-375-483-354-643; 071-701-870-764-141; 071-869-568-080-24X; 077-607-489-322-421; 077-687-097-083-620; 078-103-486-819-149; 083-644-965-338-767; 083-853-719-789-221; 097-486-921-794-506; 098-247-682-904-269; 108-596-169-184-025; 110-234-905-477-656; 121-688-852-114-696; 126-414-132-189-941; 144-457-359-759-120; 161-887-921-028-47X; 166-992-957-259-479,0,true,cc-by-nc-sa,gold

Darr; Jingyi Zhang; Neel M. Makwana; Xiaole Weng,"Nanomaterials are at the leading edge of the emerging field of nanotechnology. Their unique and tunable size-dependent properties (in the range 1–100 nm) make these materials indispensable in many modern technological applications. In this Review, we summarize the state-of-art in the manufacture and applications of inorganic nanoparticles made using continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis (CHFS) processes. First, we introduce ideal requirements of any flow process for nanoceramics production, outline different approaches to CHFS, and introduce the pertinent properties of supercritical water and issues around mixing in flow, to generate nanoparticles. This Review then gives comprehensive coverage of the current application space for CHFS-made nanomaterials including optical, healthcare, electronics (including sensors, information, and communication technologies), catalysis, devices (including energy harvesting/conversion/fuels), and energy storage applications. Thereafter, topics of precursor chemistry and ...",117,17,11125,11238,Energy harvesting; Supercritical fluid; Electronics; Nanomaterials; Nanoparticle; Nanotechnology; Chemistry; Hydrothermal synthesis;

It has brought us to Pharma 5.0, a combination of traditional biomanufacturing practices and industrial production with the latest smart technology and artificial intelligence use. These revolutionary changes can be applied to all production line aspects, from drug conception to final consumption by the consumers while still acknowledging the digitalization challenges and security issues associated. In this chapter, the ultimate integration of human and machine is discussed with the invention of bionics, for example, bionic vision and bionic limbs. The role of technology in these new manufacturing systems, such as small-scale agile manufacturing and mass production with advances occurring on the factory floor, are also detailed in this chapter. A few challenges still remain, including the impact on job security, ethical issues, problems with data processing and challenges in designing for human-computer interaction, which also need to be identified, analyzed and overcome before a transformation to the Fifth Industrial Revolution can be realized. Finally, prospective research into human-computer integration and further personalization is studied to foresee and predict imminent technologies that will become significant in Industry 5.0.",,,135,160,Engineering management; Engineering; Personalization; Biomanufacturing; Job security; Agile manufacturing; Industrial Revolution; Industrial production; Bionics; Production line,,,,,https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781003080671-7-7/medicine-pharmaceuticals-biomanufacturing-industry-5-0-zahra-nashath-doris-ying-ying-tang-kit-wayne-chew-pau-loke-show,http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9781003080671-7-7,,10.1201/9781003080671-7-7,3160660397,,0,142-761-009-318-070,0,false,,

With Industry 4.0 being unable to address and meet increased drive of personalization, the term Industry 5.0 was coined for addressing personalized manufacturing and empowering humans in manufacturing processes. The onset of the term Industry 5.0 is observed to have various views of how it is defined and what constitutes the reconciliation between humans and machines. This serves as the motivation of this paper in identifying and analyzing the various themes and research trends of what Industry 5.0 is using text mining tools and techniques. Toward this, the abstracts of 196 published papers based on the keyword “Industry 5.0” search in IEEE, science direct and MDPI data bases were extracted. Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed for further analysis to apply text mining techniques of key terms extraction and frequency analysis. Further topic mining i.e., unsupervised machine learning method was used for exploring the data. It is observed that the terms artificial intelligence (AI), big data, supply chain, digital transformation, machine learning, internet of things (IoT), are among the most often used and among several enablers that have been identified by researchers to drive Industry 5.0. Five major themes of Industry 5.0 addressing, supply chain evaluation and optimization, enterprise innovation and digitization, smart and sustainable manufacturing, transformation driven by IoT, AI, and Big Data, and Human-machine connectivity were classified among the published literature, highlighting the research themes that can be further explored. It is observed that the theme of Industry 5.0 as a gateway towards human machine connectivity and co-existence is gaining more interest among the research community in the recent years.</jats:p>",5,1,27,27,Big data; Digitization; Industry 4.0; Automation; Computer science; Data science; Identification (biology); Personalization; Digital transformation; Supply chain; Manufacturing; Industrial Revolution; Data pre-processing; Artificial intelligence; Knowledge management,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/asi5010027,,10.3390/asi5010027,,,0,007-805-294-452-363; 014-701-830-171-774; 014-934-290-898-725; 017-415-713-662-955; 018-320-239-571-451; 024-494-460-611-587; 027-188-932-616-882; 027-519-650-344-683; 028-449-924-497-640; 029-087-799-772-164; 033-965-786-944-095; 039-236-353-346-581; 039-547-585-466-302; 042-903-381-502-080; 044-628-273-462-359; 044-998-373-851-683; 045-021-026-328-000; 046-819-137-590-094; 047-486-990-455-440; 048-092-008-205-493; 049-534-371-095-200; 049-816-999-056-296; 050-940-763-389-186; 057-110-051-295-255; 057-727-174-826-765; 058-724-297-819-998; 059-651-423-638-701; 067-215-875-080-779; 069-133-957-040-416; 070-609-833-244-587; 073-449-782-412-059; 075-188-830-741-966; 075-662-363-625-645; 076-991-386-599-906; 080-444-539-645-101; 083-256-551-682-432; 084-067-257-212-804; 085-056-587-927-434; 094-019-830-401-584; 101-407-888-546-440; 106-219-551-506-80X; 113-890-075-887-027; 117-455-364-766-44X; 124-064-639-371-099; 131-968-199-726-102; 132-974-802-685-77X; 138-332-915-687-580; 146-536-286-495-045; 153-560-894-890-798; 154-882-045-080-430; 162-124-681-890-431; 170-988-797-789-464; 175-919-077-874-030; 181-601-884-521-300; 198-555-263-184-447,10,true,cc-by,gold

Khanova,"The key factors of the development of the transport and logistics industry in the context of the digital transformation of society are highlighted. The definition of a transport and logistics project is given, and its main processes are highlighted (production/delivery of the cargoes to the warehouse/terminal, handling operations with the cargoes, storage of the cargoes, transportation of the cargoes), and additional processes (conversion/reconstruction of the cargoes, flow of funds). The specific features of the transport and logistics process, including many stochastic factors that determine the need for the use of simulation modeling methods, are noted. From the point of view of the theory of organizational systems, the structure of the transport and logistics project management system is proposed. The managed subjects—processes of the transport and logistics project are described in detail and structured. A model of decision-making by managed subjects is constructed. An example of a simulation model of a transport and logistics project for the delivery of equipment for a wind power plant is considered. The description of the submodels of the simulation model is given in accordance with the developed generalized management structure of the transport and logistics process. Experiments were carried out, optimal production intensities were identified for a transport and logistics project for the delivery of equipment for a wind power plant.KeywordsTransport and logistics projectManagementSimulation modelingExperiments",,,301,313,Context (archaeology); Integrated logistics support; Process (computing); Traffic management; Logistics management; Process management; Transport engineering; Systems engineering; Operations research,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-95112-2_25,,10.1007/978-3-030-95112-2_25,,,0,000-017-524-448-705; 001-517-664-689-970; 001-784-782-687-77X; 022-199-783-341-919; 026-601-261-307-949; 041-437-717-635-476; 047-016-117-791-830; 058-183-437-441-618; 059-871-104-688-984; 061-946-181-641-210; 064-309-940-839-074; 075-066-196-655-079; 084-099-767-037-336; 084-214-657-244-706; 087-779-774-715-033; 109-963-395-691-437; 120-662-621-142-76X,0,false,,

Martins; Bernardo Firme; Susana M. Vieira; João Figueiredo; João M. C. Sousa,"<jats:p>In the last few decades, there has been a growing necessity for systems that handle market changes and personalized customer needs with near mass production efficiency, defined as the new mass customization paradigm. The Industry 5.0 vision further enhances the human-centricity aspect, in the necessity for manufacturing systems to cooperate with workers, taking advantage of their problem-solving capabilities, creativity, and expertise of the manufacturing process. A solution is to develop a flexible manufacturing system capable of handling different customer requests and real-time decisions from operators. This paper tackles these aspects by proposing a digital twin of a robotic system for solution preparation capable of making real-time scheduling decisions and forecasts using a simulation model while allowing human interventions. A discrete event simulation model was used to forecast possible system improvements. The simulation handles real-time scheduling considering the possibility of adding identical parallel machines. Results show that processing multiple jobs simultaneously with more than one machine on critical processes, increasing the robot speed, and using heuristics that emphasize the shortest transportation time can reduce the overall completion time by 82%. The simulation model has an animated visualization window for a deeper understanding of the system.</jats:p>",3,1,153,175,Mass customization; Computer science; Scheduling (production processes); Heuristics; Industrial engineering; Process (computing); Distributed computing; Discrete event simulation; Personalization; Visualization; Robot,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/automation3010008,,10.3390/automation3010008,,,0,007-805-294-452-363; 010-260-118-194-175; 010-971-427-653-196; 011-726-938-781-058; 024-452-826-709-349; 028-382-877-382-539; 035-934-634-315-477; 035-935-979-832-597; 050-310-207-201-238; 060-798-107-606-54X; 064-643-758-694-642; 064-894-531-090-939; 067-827-716-189-926; 068-581-894-936-284; 089-541-344-480-329; 103-240-324-065-730; 104-437-659-897-868; 127-991-143-159-728; 134-267-591-969-86X; 138-193-487-989-293; 146-906-518-666-700; 149-780-063-832-95X; 156-699-961-874-866,2,true,cc-by,gold

The uniqueness of the approach is the provision of the smart city topology as a set of cyber-physical clusters that ensure the functioning of the city. Unlike existing solutions, the proposed approach allows to consider the relationship of the information flows between different levels of smart city systems. Considered features of modeling of the cyber-physical water supply system (including active control system models, resource allocation models, scenario modeling) were put into practice by the smart city infrastructure in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The analysis of the functioning of the megalopolis water supply enterprise revealed significant vulnerabilities in ensuring the strategic security of the Leningrad Region, Russia. A basic list of recommendations for reducing the probability of water shortage has been developed based on scenario modeling of disabling of the main water supply source. These results are the basis for creating simulation models of interrupting the main source of smart city water supply and considering issues of improving the efficiency of water supply cyber-physical systems control in the smart city.",,,75,90,Simulation modeling; Risk analysis (engineering); Cyber-physical system; Control (management); Smart city; Resource allocation; Saint petersburg; Computer science; Water scarcity; Water supply,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-63563-3_7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63563-3_7,,10.1007/978-3-030-63563-3_7,3118789882,,0,000-964-367-627-27X; 004-289-210-406-099; 005-990-462-261-828; 006-783-993-101-692; 012-612-892-632-647; 013-505-475-925-572; 014-731-180-040-437; 029-317-563-787-838; 031-113-185-422-010; 102-395-295-360-780; 117-585-003-030-408; 126-388-186-894-439; 133-731-560-527-313,3,false,,

Industry 4.0 offers a range of opportunities for companies to increase the flexibility and efficiency of production processes. The development of new business models can be promoted with digital platforms and architectures for Industry 4.0. Therefore, products from the healthcare sector can increase in value. The adaptive integrated digital architecture framework (AIDAF) for Industry 4.0 is expected to promote and implement the digital platforms and robotics for healthcare and medical communities efficiently. In this paper, we propose that various digital platforms and robotics are designed and evaluated for digital healthcare as for manufacturing industry with Industry 4.0. We argue that the design of an open healthcare platform “Open Healthcare Platform 2030 - OHP2030” for medical product design and robotics can be developed with AIDAF.

At the same time, production and processes must become more flexible, and humans have to adapt to new products more often and even faster. Industry 5.0 will increasingly focus on human-centric approaches, on the collaboration of humans and machines intensively using cognitive assistance systems. The design of an innovative cognitive assistance system is a complex task due to the many technological opportunities and their interrelationships. In the framework of this research, a method was developed enabling the systematic design of cognitive assistance systems that integrates business and worker requirements aiming at improving productivity, quality, worker satisfaction and well-being. The research question was approached by design science research having, as the main output, a systematic and innovative method for the design of cognitive assistance systems based on quality function deployment (QFD), referred to as cognitive assistance system-QFD (CAS-QFD). The developed methodology is divided into six phases and includes the iterative design of a cognitive assistance system starting from the assembly process. The method considers the information needs of the workers, the definition of the appropriate assistance functions and the selection of the interaction technologies. The exemplarily industrial evaluation highlighted the relevance of CAS-QFD for systematically designing cognitive assistance systems based on holistic requirements, identified at the worker, workplace, production area and, finally, at the enterprise level.</jats:p>",12,8,3887,3887,Quality function deployment; Computer science; Cognition; Process management; Knowledge management; Quality (philosophy); Function (biology); Product (mathematics); Software deployment; New product development; Engineering; Risk analysis (engineering),,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app12083887,,10.3390/app12083887,,,0,000-069-943-339-065; 000-872-737-954-983; 001-351-732-679-356; 001-369-603-792-163; 002-432-260-051-325; 003-304-795-752-398; 003-402-941-003-045; 003-980-176-434-087; 004-725-793-952-304; 004-849-244-126-557; 004-894-291-973-153; 006-503-299-476-612; 007-231-299-750-554; 008-479-689-591-531; 008-837-372-853-983; 010-948-310-625-743; 011-815-973-316-025; 012-437-209-240-935; 014-095-246-794-414; 014-224-044-628-176; 014-409-325-602-395; 017-415-713-662-955; 017-459-070-179-170; 018-109-334-369-944; 019-248-560-687-277; 021-605-309-335-356; 021-882-778-999-476; 022-790-621-879-431; 023-831-765-465-494; 024-953-859-303-113; 025-942-041-625-709; 028-005-753-183-913; 029-515-808-095-205; 033-541-372-628-755; 037-277-785-325-862; 037-508-704-688-473; 038-287-375-579-320; 038-964-429-089-518; 044-401-516-642-156; 047-885-778-073-419; 047-913-991-153-149; 049-583-824-023-48X; 051-661-268-905-301; 059-514-085-671-822; 059-985-451-979-992; 062-806-191-230-329; 063-640-226-807-415; 063-944-254-756-689; 065-663-107-957-263; 067-275-171-224-003; 068-269-681-965-966; 070-246-603-420-514; 073-932-262-960-174; 074-305-604-659-474; 076-243-578-348-104; 077-581-622-629-076; 084-249-962-919-116; 084-290-060-977-207; 085-033-284-767-478; 086-366-755-495-395; 086-420-480-368-083; 087-157-957-268-743; 088-878-503-413-754; 101-524-432-756-450; 102-679-146-041-844; 103-463-172-499-414; 104-580-494-317-758; 106-503-170-178-863; 108-512-420-405-246; 109-568-141-046-083; 110-510-842-185-282; 118-401-703-686-43X; 122-209-874-729-144; 123-878-469-773-680; 127-876-680-459-642; 137-761-456-237-909; 138-232-752-906-225; 138-529-852-670-835; 141-565-165-447-275; 143-614-890-730-998; 148-940-277-668-378; 150-451-296-261-738; 152-235-455-044-105; 153-500-855-102-299; 159-631-748-884-043; 159-850-409-679-715; 165-669-901-223-630; 165-743-992-734-50X; 173-929-862-162-764; 187-357-390-633-368,1,true,cc-by,gold

Industry 5.0 recognizes the power of industry in achieving societal goals beyond jobs and growth to become a resilient provider of prosperity by directing production towards respecting the boundaries of our planet and placing the well-being of the industry worker at the center of the production process. Contrary to the trends in Industry 4.0 toward technology, dehumanization, technological advancement and innovation best practices, Industry 5.0 will bend back toward serving humanity. At workplaces, this industrial revolution will shed greater light on the human intelligence than ever. The challenge now is to examine the influence of soft skills to enhance the workforce in order to prepare them for Industry 5.0. Emotional intelligence is a soft skill. The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of emotional intelligence on enhancing the workforce for Industry 5.0. A total of 110 executives took part in this study. Findings suggest that emotional intelligence does influence the workforce to perform better.

This development entails that job transformations and future skills need attention from the perspective of industry 5.0, where human and machine find ways of working together to improve production performance. Facing this perspective, one challenge is a growing need for novel lifelong learning initiatives, to meet emerging and altering occupations for the fulfilment of future skill requirements. This challenge is addressed here by portraying a case where three Swedish universities have formed a distinctive collaboration to develop a flexible (i.e. blended) course for professionals, in the subject of Digitally-enabled production. The purpose is to develop a sustainable collaboration between the universities and create a course format on master level addressing lifelong learning for the increasingly digitalized production. The ambition is to increase the impact of the universities respective efforts by sharing resources and utilizing individual specialized expertise to develop a practical and relevant course that can reach a larger target group. The course encompasses industry 4.0 readiness on three levels of production systems; plant-, production cell-, and component level; to adopt a holistic view of digitalization in production. We followed an action research approach for continuously collecting and documenting our experiences during the course development, implementation, and dissemination of the course. Within the frame of action research, an explorative case study describes and analyzes the initiative. The results highlight challenges and opportunities for succeeding with this form of co-produced course. The joint course gives professionals possibilities to work on cases from their own companies with expert supervision from three manufacturing levels to address complex challenges in industry 4.0 implementation. To conclude, the importance of lifelong learning in relation to the human-centric approach of industry 5.0 is emphasized as a future direction.</jats:p>",,,,,Lifelong learning; Production (economics); Knowledge management; Engineering; Perspective (graphical); Action (physics); Engineering ethics; Business; Engineering management,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/atde220184,,10.3233/atde220184,,,0,,0,true,,gold

It has seen a rapid increase in the elderly population and a decrease in the birth rate. This caused Japan to be a hyper-ageing society. Japanese’s first Baby-boomers who were born in 1947-1949 are now entering old age. Elderly care is a major problem in Japan. Children and care-workers for elderly parents are scarce. Therefore, the second Baby-boomers (born in 1971-1974) aged 40-50 years old have quit working to care for their elderly parents. This situation is known as ‘kaigo rishoku.’ This study looked into the practice of elderly care in Japanese 5.0 Society. Society 5.0 is a concept developed by Japan. It is human-centred and technology-based. In society 5.0, robots and the internet play an essential role in human life. Therefore, we proposed a critical question: Can robots replace humans to care for the elderly in Society 5.0? This study used the qualitative method with a phenomenological approach and descriptive analysis. The results revealed that although robots can assist elderly care, due to the high cost, only a certain elderly can buy them. Therefore, in order for robots to become caregivers of the future, mass production is needed. Thus, robots can be marketed at relatively lower prices. However, sick elderly who live alone still need human assistance. On the one hand, technology helps human life in Society 5.0. On the other hand, the human touch is still necessary for elderly care.",4,2,435,452,Psychology; Elderly parents; Ageing society; Critical question; Elderly care; Human life; Elderly population; Birth rate; Descriptive statistics; Gerontology,,,,,https://ejournal.unitomo.ac.id/index.php/jsk/article/download/2448/1166 https://ejournal.unitomo.ac.id/index.php/jsk/article/view/2448,http://dx.doi.org/10.25139/jsk.v4i2.2448,,10.25139/jsk.v4i2.2448,3040585712,,0,,3,true,cc-by-sa,gold

In this context, which is characterized by a large gap between training and operative processes, a dedicated method is required to manage and extract the massive amount of data and the related information mining. The method presented in this work aims to reduce this gap with near-zero-failure advanced diagnostics (AD) for smart management, which is exploitable in any context of Society 5.0, thus reducing the risk factors at all management levels and ensuring quality and sustainability. We have also developed innovative applications for a human-centered management system to support scheduling in the maintenance of operative processes, for reducing training costs, for improving production yield, and for creating a human–machine cyberspace for smart infrastructure design. The results obtained in 12 international companies demonstrate a possible global standardization of operative processes, leading to the design of a near-zero-failure intelligent system that is able to learn and upgrade itself. Our new method provides guidance for selecting the new generation of intelligent manufacturing and smart systems in order to optimize human–machine interactions, with the related smart maintenance and education.",6,7,835,846,Scheduling (computing); Artificial intelligence; Smart system; Standardization; Management system; Quality (business); Context (language use); Cyberspace; Computer science; Big data,,,,Grant 2017; Cariparma Foundation; Department of Medicine and Surgery; CSEIA,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095809920300266 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2095809920300266 https://doaj.org/article/3f55db5b87c9467da9dd400862a40b76 https://air.unipr.it/handle/11381/2872548,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eng.2019.11.014,,10.1016/j.eng.2019.11.014,3003162042,,0,000-695-624-225-501; 001-323-429-375-458; 001-462-248-576-023; 003-821-070-459-763; 007-863-302-831-562; 009-925-932-430-898; 012-373-473-281-736; 013-308-381-667-776; 015-179-947-788-927; 020-680-911-838-355; 022-380-596-265-048; 022-883-462-323-85X; 024-301-292-916-563; 024-533-356-605-434; 024-686-978-205-387; 025-508-842-268-05X; 028-232-581-949-707; 029-088-494-457-336; 029-522-085-058-640; 029-761-682-813-729; 030-139-354-389-282; 031-506-949-907-374; 032-055-105-686-264; 033-463-729-344-544; 036-048-873-809-458; 043-866-693-114-286; 045-936-475-493-242; 048-827-579-519-108; 050-803-018-211-918; 051-118-827-089-028; 051-969-387-725-363; 052-227-014-472-221; 054-971-734-581-504; 057-034-975-930-616; 063-483-909-050-195; 071-473-279-124-057; 074-482-942-286-276; 078-505-826-257-819; 079-796-431-947-902; 080-900-769-184-108; 082-444-578-495-751; 084-640-871-954-292; 085-710-989-349-829; 088-286-897-179-745; 095-657-169-699-869; 097-115-411-543-915; 098-276-959-684-741; 098-621-664-553-79X; 100-124-216-391-558; 106-971-451-537-030; 113-688-605-343-205; 113-844-783-102-633; 118-370-935-746-471; 129-718-596-982-317; 137-321-353-227-821; 140-478-325-778-398; 141-520-178-697-83X; 146-119-252-820-906; 156-099-468-912-647; 165-778-127-427-88X; 168-757-667-266-956; 170-343-790-752-628; 174-539-731-574-243; 175-785-932-198-352,51,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

Unlike Industry 4.0, Industry 5.0 continues to rely on the role of human beings, and is human-centered in its use, so that the role of human beings is not degraded or replaced. The role of humans in Industry 5.0, in addition to having a positive impact, also has the potential of leading to negative impacts, which are now widely found in the circulation of hoaxes, online persecution (doxing), and also online radicalization, which are spread using the Internet. The sources of the data in this study are the results of in-depth interviews with social observers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and Indonesia Tanpa Pacaran members as primary data sources. The findings of this study reinforce the notion that Indonesia Tanpa Pacaran is a highly exclusionary movement. This movement is hostile to people outside their groups on the basis of differences in identity and extreme understanding of Islamic values. Besides, this movement is also found to be radical, because it encourages marriage by ignoring the process of becoming acquainted, and the social dynamics between individuals. Another finding is that this movement also has the potential to encourage social conflict in a pluralistic Indonesian society.",,,,,Human resources; Social relation; Political economy; Political science; Radicalization; Identity (social science); Islam; Social media; Social dynamics; Social conflict,,,,,https://eprints.eudl.eu/id/eprint/1474/ https://eudl.eu/doi/10.4108/eai.16-10-2019.2304332,http://dx.doi.org/10.4108/eai.16-10-2019.2304332,,10.4108/eai.16-10-2019.2304332,3127474042,,0,018-475-627-014-282; 020-888-200-021-317; 034-582-624-437-371; 090-246-245-041-551; 126-814-702-779-875; 134-197-876-576-903; 181-112-366-667-53X; 183-292-079-839-750,0,true,,bronze

Based on the concepts of Industry 4.0, several variations emerged, such as Logistics 4.0, Health 4.0, and Agriculture 4.0. However, it was in Japan that the idea Society 5.0 emerged, which promises the application of all aspects of the fourth revolution and its consequences in a fully autonomous society. The present work compares Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0 in relation to origin, structuring elements and use of technology. The methodology used was a bibliographical research. The result presents a list of 10 characteristics that compare the year of creation of the concept, country of origin, motivating need, level of urgency, focus, scope of application, use of technology, degree of use of artificial intelligence, fundamental elements and developments from the concept.

The industrial system is shifting from manufacturing worksite superiority to intelligence or software superiority in manufacturing. The government promotes these trends through its Society 5.0 initiative. Software superiority in manufacturing facilitates front loading; the conversion of skills to explicit knowledge makes progress in manufacturing processes through the use of IT and craftsmanship. This research deals with three cases. The first case is a company-developed system that’s scalable from customized products to standard products and that realizes diversified products via microscale production. The second case, focusing on the introduction of robots and a robot system integrator (SIer), is the keystone company within the SIer community; its business consists of robot engineering projects and FA educational system projects. The third case, metal 3D printing manufacturing, is invigorating. The company is the first service bureau in Japan that is capable of providing comprehensive services in the field of metal additive manufacturing (AM), handling everything from powder development and manufacture to prototyping and mass production needs. Clearly, IoT and the servitization of industry are the two wheels of a cart in industry, significantly transforming not only manufacturing sites but also business models. Although each case represents a different field of industry, each meets a unique and remarkable challenge in standardization, platform and ecosystem. In the digital age, IoT is an enabler and provides a background for transformation of business models. Through servitization, businesses can be the field for co-creation by feeding back the experience of learning-by-doing and reorganizing it. It is a powerful option for company to meet the challenge of service platform building.",,,139,151,Manufacturing engineering; Engineering; Business ecosystem; Standardization; Service bureau; Service (systems architecture); Business model; Explicit knowledge; Big data; Robot,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-981-15-0327-6_10,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-0327-6_10,,10.1007/978-981-15-0327-6_10,2992507246,,0,005-590-991-432-327; 021-659-408-664-722; 031-257-287-841-710; 038-161-639-277-315; 052-699-256-660-538; 061-929-854-108-644; 068-845-684-040-670; 078-514-027-813-844; 081-731-396-186-128; 084-960-640-918-211; 085-657-106-088-742; 095-218-964-500-148; 119-256-337-361-325,0,false,,

It has also freed business activity from a focus on place, as both work activities and markets have been able to harness information and communication technologies in order to operate remotely. As a result, researchers have highlighted a phenomenon of ‘smart’ working. Some have pointed to a fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) in which ‘smart’ factories use robotics to achieve high performance. There is now a suggestion of progress towards Industry 5.0, in which technological and social systems work in harmony to deliver personalised mass customization of products and services. This paper examines these developments from the perspective of unique, individual understandings of work roles and sustainability, posing the questions ‘Smart’ from whose point of view? Do smart systems promote sustainable organizations? How should design of smart systems be approached? It suggests that contemporary socio-technical systems approaches to organizational analysis are the best way to support harnessing of smart technologies in organizations.",22,2,281,298,Engineering; Sociotechnical system; Smart system; Organizational analysis; Sustainability organizations; Industry 4.0; Knowledge management; Sustainability; Information and Communications Technology; Mass customization,,,,University of Portsmouth,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:spr:infosf:v:22:y:2020:i:2:d:10.1007_s10796-019-09921-1 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10796-019-09921-1.pdf https://www.scilit.net/article/045597f38ab8e46bd3e4b6ef2cbd057d https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/isf/isf22.html#BednarW20 https://doi.org/10.1007/s10796-019-09921-1 https://portal.research.lu.se/en/publications/socio-technical-perspectives-on-smart-working-creating-meaningful https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/1ce530bd-2aa7-409e-b2b6-522a6b7c57b0 https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/portal/files/14211480/Socio_Technical_Perspectives_on_Smart_Working.pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/infosf/v22y2020i2d10.1007_s10796-019-09921-1.html https://puredev.port.ac.uk/en/publications/socio-technical-perspectives-on-smart-working-creating-meaningful https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10796-019-09921-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10796-019-09921-1,,10.1007/s10796-019-09921-1,2942942407,,0,003-022-686-079-899; 004-345-310-789-588; 005-678-500-548-787; 005-796-039-321-468; 006-558-608-005-442; 007-804-632-977-10X; 013-679-697-508-627; 014-461-421-539-363; 014-909-545-302-926; 015-041-524-925-027; 015-218-998-128-071; 018-345-855-897-35X; 019-385-196-565-281; 019-617-094-191-522; 020-423-916-366-775; 020-651-729-317-681; 021-741-156-825-990; 024-601-766-545-886; 024-863-314-645-595; 026-895-802-475-205; 028-922-696-189-478; 030-104-527-656-466; 030-314-174-466-581; 030-894-861-122-266; 031-293-783-222-28X; 034-442-957-662-943; 034-610-399-035-493; 043-024-581-749-788; 045-732-333-571-271; 050-056-756-492-428; 050-775-143-584-232; 050-860-336-524-54X; 051-038-112-216-29X; 052-121-237-562-341; 057-362-012-774-107; 057-981-589-705-723; 059-198-406-242-083; 060-210-028-318-574; 061-106-551-419-704; 063-999-037-292-53X; 064-847-525-020-457; 067-945-789-277-668; 068-449-861-799-326; 071-387-505-557-483; 072-144-569-097-965; 072-835-920-895-175; 073-123-784-675-864; 082-193-643-919-968; 086-285-005-719-092; 088-273-808-364-904; 091-841-640-811-109; 092-699-978-647-571; 097-244-778-994-553; 098-533-945-081-821; 103-283-718-200-405; 104-693-310-977-403; 104-963-683-392-202; 105-179-598-653-786; 111-918-374-133-371; 112-861-543-573-16X; 114-333-407-393-539; 116-059-643-746-15X; 117-376-485-698-53X; 123-744-689-550-151; 124-346-728-819-292; 124-608-872-203-393; 125-795-343-058-314; 130-454-466-144-47X; 130-540-877-159-511; 134-950-813-808-882; 136-481-382-051-219; 137-185-405-417-755; 137-212-418-154-019; 138-383-642-197-075; 140-488-596-514-465; 145-614-119-612-544; 148-147-612-350-364; 150-145-703-941-867; 150-311-659-083-789; 152-317-375-052-868; 153-062-580-291-31X; 158-785-343-262-786; 159-117-779-555-822; 163-637-734-144-951; 176-241-134-682-896; 185-492-912-762-888; 186-041-334-475-521; 190-388-862-099-07X; 199-591-752-874-216,84,true,cc-by,hybrid

In conducting interactions, each individual can experience communication fears where individuals tend to experience anxiety because too much information is received. The group can be one of the very positive spheres of communication. The object of this research is Basmala members, who have various backgrounds as members of Islamic spiritual groups who uphold religious values. This research uses a qualitative research method with an ethnomethodology type that looks at how the disclosure of reality in people's lives and how individuals receive, learn, apply information provided in the community. Basmala is an Islamic spiritual organization whose members are students. As a religious organization where the culture and activities of the organization also have characteristics that can lead to the basic rules of religion that are expected to familiarize its members to deal with differences in the communication process to overcome the causes of communication apprehension</jats:p>",5,1,,,Sociology; Apprehension; Social communication; Ethnomethodology; Social psychology,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.25008/jkiski.v5i1.362 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/326032945.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.25008/jkiski.v5i1.362,,10.25008/jkiski.v5i1.362,3033070092,,0,,0,true,cc-by-sa,gold

Bokoro; Ravi Sharma,"Industry 4.0 have witnessed a paradigm shift from cyber-physical systems (CPS) that aims at massive automation, towards a more customer-driven approach. The shift has been attributed to the design of hyper-cognitive systems, integration of virtual and extended reality, digital machinery prototyping and twin designs, trusted machine boundaries, collaborative robots, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based supply chains. This new wave, termed Industry 5.0, is expected to leverage massive production with user-centric customization outside the scope of Industry 4.0 ecosystems. Industry 5.0 is expected to assist diverse industrial verticals like healthcare, smart farming, drones, smart grids, and supply chain production ecosystems. However, data is shared among multiple heterogeneous networks, spanning different authoritative domains. Thus, trusted and secured data transfer is crucial to synergize and secure the industrial perimeters. Blockchain (BC) is a preferred choice as a security enabler to Industry 5.0 ecosystems owing to its inherent property of immutability, chronology, and auditability in industrial systems. Limited works are proposed that present the vision and holistic view of BC-assisted Industry 5.0 applications. The article presents a first-of-its-kind survey on BC as a security enabler in Industry 5.0. Based on a descriptive survey methodology and research questions, we presented the key drivers, and potential applications, and propose an architectural vision of BC-based Industry 5.0 in diverse applicative verticals. The survey intends to present solutions that would assist industry practitioners, academicians, and researchers to drive novel BC-assisted solutions in Industry 5.0 verticals.",10,,69160,69199,Computer science; Industry 4.0; Enabling; Supply chain; Leverage (statistics); Cyber-physical system; Automation; Knowledge management,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/access.2022.3186892,,10.1109/access.2022.3186892,,,0,002-236-912-573-164; 002-353-588-124-596; 003-216-340-688-115; 003-473-713-702-678; 006-393-402-818-154; 006-410-761-941-121; 007-807-637-396-500; 009-092-087-038-843; 009-225-827-148-391; 010-322-762-544-333; 010-521-304-001-114; 010-747-626-272-891; 010-824-551-630-821; 011-192-864-302-160; 012-209-739-929-356; 013-923-582-078-155; 016-007-042-471-154; 016-008-231-623-959; 017-415-713-662-955; 017-500-567-624-366; 017-863-697-301-63X; 018-052-485-977-475; 018-163-557-258-966; 019-729-680-880-124; 019-739-704-167-489; 020-415-324-452-397; 022-009-961-738-792; 022-173-842-054-587; 022-284-071-503-277; 023-465-371-433-193; 023-670-462-834-50X; 024-238-489-930-925; 025-936-736-211-659; 027-041-113-065-750; 027-706-236-841-522; 030-353-628-080-985; 030-359-513-497-577; 030-471-475-399-908; 030-824-319-524-202; 031-248-151-579-851; 032-456-953-732-97X; 033-274-213-180-662; 033-670-310-722-296; 033-864-214-273-49X; 033-992-942-858-716; 034-549-019-524-667; 034-918-791-985-056; 035-291-444-857-893; 036-629-081-571-010; 037-605-333-157-677; 038-039-692-670-459; 040-004-393-245-69X; 040-838-688-716-533; 041-445-937-726-732; 042-394-228-997-686; 044-585-731-859-189; 044-965-320-769-618; 045-649-246-834-013; 046-088-866-770-62X; 046-372-786-377-586; 047-171-021-612-244; 047-232-961-833-828; 048-092-008-205-493; 048-913-754-026-986; 048-947-028-622-148; 049-816-999-056-296; 050-191-879-559-444; 050-348-593-199-300; 050-355-705-622-288; 050-936-870-958-266; 051-701-241-542-305; 052-487-428-420-879; 054-079-583-763-10X; 055-272-736-924-578; 055-815-731-328-951; 057-052-559-177-505; 057-201-196-855-499; 057-581-470-987-791; 059-065-708-616-221; 059-255-225-376-988; 059-350-748-572-529; 059-454-608-799-883; 060-139-154-931-258; 061-076-248-538-933; 061-439-638-833-25X; 062-000-485-706-334; 065-279-068-716-216; 066-121-213-566-725; 067-754-156-733-385; 069-575-317-045-364; 070-283-742-732-350; 071-176-890-544-418; 071-935-443-374-562; 073-044-822-678-949; 074-849-299-992-419; 076-139-893-215-694; 076-219-389-310-879; 077-056-219-333-085; 078-383-255-823-473; 081-485-472-168-802; 081-658-056-336-195; 084-022-778-722-165; 085-669-031-634-697; 086-878-191-211-287; 086-979-013-948-916; 090-990-598-818-341; 093-473-259-348-545; 094-382-541-310-391; 095-603-940-135-095; 096-091-715-269-337; 096-126-705-119-818; 098-869-802-827-162; 100-764-538-512-485; 101-535-958-642-486; 103-377-120-514-204; 103-630-083-826-79X; 103-943-012-588-824; 105-410-518-501-424; 107-848-353-443-906; 110-049-456-492-089; 113-830-545-572-413; 115-207-236-810-412; 118-414-114-154-649; 119-066-027-229-09X; 120-640-192-653-82X; 122-415-737-508-326; 127-087-661-937-707; 127-975-637-406-696; 133-080-277-617-536; 136-434-747-919-999; 137-893-528-768-771; 140-662-666-464-282; 144-045-269-319-956; 149-322-612-082-39X; 149-970-235-376-864; 157-522-909-138-24X; 171-492-165-597-365; 172-846-246-022-661; 180-114-367-188-293; 180-590-216-657-248; 185-383-918-375-00X; 186-621-468-641-792; 188-533-397-393-420; 189-021-951-155-575; 197-730-821-984-158; 199-760-729-412-114,0,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

To maintain production and adjust quickly to technological transformation, innovative work-based learning approaches are emphasized. Intelligent machines are becoming capable of interaction and collaboration with humans. They not only introduce a new type of learnable workforce to manufacturing but may open opportunities to enhance learning of all learners. Symbiotic relationships of humans and machines have wide potential for human-centric manufacturing (aka Industry 5.0). Moreover, connecting smart devices and deploying self-learning solutions is envisioned to increase flexibility of manufacturing, thus changing work division between humans and machines. Where humans and machines collaborate, the term Reciprocal Learning has been coined to describe the process of bidirectional learning. While a definition of Reciprocal Learning exists the boundary conditions of the concept are still ambiguous. In this paper, a framework for Reciprocal Learning in Human-Machine Collaboration for Industry 5.0 is presented to clarify what it is and what it isn’t. The approach is based on a multi-agent system perspective, comprising human and machine agents. Finally, an outlook on future research is presented.</jats:p>",,,207,225,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.30844/wgab_2022_11,,10.30844/wgab_2022_11,,,0,,0,false,,

A unified functional structure of simulators, information, mathematics, and software was created, which is a flexible customizable environment for this class of objects. Based on the information and mathematical support, training scenarios are developed in which different situations and disturbances are modeled by changing the model coefficients and varying the values of variables in the ranges of change. To develop interfaces as close as possible to real objects in a limited time frame, a SCADA HMI was used. The methodology for the development of computer simulators has been tested on the example of electrochemical and electrothermal production of aluminum, calcium carbide, and phosphorus.

One possibility to decrease the educational inequality is to provide remote access to facilities that enable learning and training. A similar approach of remote resource usage can be utilized in resource-poor situations where the required equipment is available at other premises. The concept of Industry 5.0 (i5.0) focuses on a human-centric approach, enabling technologies to concentrate on human–machine interaction and emphasizing the importance of societal values. This paper introduces a novel robotics teleoperation platform supported by the i5.0. The platform reduces inequality and allows usage and learning of robotics remotely independently of time and location. The platform is based on digital twins with bi-directional data transmission between the physical and digital counterparts. The proposed system allows teleoperation, remote programming, and near real-time monitoring of controlled robots, robot time scheduling, and social interaction between users. The system design and implementation are described in detail, followed by experimental results.</jats:p>",10,7,577,577,Teleoperation; Robotics; Artificial intelligence; Robot; Computer science; Human–computer interaction; Scheduling (production processes); Multimedia,,,,EU Horizon 2020,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/machines10070577,,10.3390/machines10070577,,,0,002-813-714-346-46X; 003-179-703-682-143; 010-424-152-143-951; 011-018-575-862-58X; 012-669-174-018-965; 013-502-644-470-932; 027-944-621-290-273; 028-588-240-223-091; 029-768-636-817-157; 034-444-580-767-102; 034-506-672-659-070; 035-358-475-696-790; 038-335-126-944-44X; 043-375-034-113-54X; 048-790-051-246-942; 049-622-811-335-600; 052-854-318-373-399; 059-871-239-589-908; 060-044-156-666-388; 068-308-324-307-163; 075-901-752-374-937; 081-252-037-579-984; 084-273-617-270-870; 092-103-011-378-295; 092-275-640-011-112; 094-940-802-045-981; 100-155-128-015-781; 102-976-888-430-153; 105-598-603-181-952; 110-393-950-294-830; 114-427-522-890-36X; 116-288-374-568-701; 121-824-617-710-758; 125-253-990-997-32X; 128-765-989-396-787; 161-247-693-259-018; 161-364-062-708-289; 168-165-277-294-303; 174-929-266-453-318; 179-350-082-288-468; 186-076-327-543-645,2,true,cc-by,gold

In industrial design and engineering, HCD is very useful in helping to achieve the novel Industry 5.0 concept, based on improving workers’ wellbeing by providing prosperity beyond jobs and growth, while respecting the production limits of the planet as recently promoted by the European Commission. In this context, the paper proposes an ergonomic assessment method based on the analysis of the workers’ workload to support the design of industrial products and processes. This allows the simultaneous analysis of the physical and cognitive workload of operators while performing their tasks during their shift. The method uses a minimum set of non-invasive wearable devices to monitor human activity and physiological parameters, in addition to questionnaires for subjective self-assessment. The method has been preliminarily tested on a real industrial case in order to demonstrate how it can help companies to support the design of optimized products and processes promoting the workers’ wellbeing.</jats:p>",11,24,12066,12066,Workload; Prosperity; Industrial design; Computer science; Industrial production; Context (archaeology); Production (economics); Wearable computer; Set (abstract data type); Order (exchange); Risk analysis (engineering); Engineering; Manufacturing engineering,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app112412066,,10.3390/app112412066,,,0,000-092-050-655-912; 001-610-028-097-719; 011-797-116-120-363; 015-653-610-660-552; 015-983-125-274-991; 016-666-693-760-450; 017-347-484-948-762; 017-846-386-908-966; 020-090-924-990-874; 022-549-364-411-596; 029-170-236-791-182; 031-294-750-698-550; 031-327-169-344-060; 031-536-913-674-625; 032-407-189-277-21X; 033-460-825-764-692; 033-501-434-688-037; 034-656-952-641-047; 037-640-436-356-285; 039-529-798-287-94X; 041-064-292-292-439; 041-409-865-990-383; 052-363-292-004-512; 054-779-705-781-240; 055-172-065-076-628; 062-039-691-567-329; 064-232-901-689-613; 071-959-788-500-196; 073-439-602-104-579; 078-717-879-357-64X; 084-009-219-588-397; 087-157-957-268-743; 091-157-237-382-235; 094-300-412-136-41X; 112-003-142-597-733; 112-329-009-122-851; 116-307-443-152-314; 135-922-279-158-08X; 138-097-221-744-109; 138-529-852-670-835; 142-819-164-052-144; 165-437-465-098-550; 172-463-005-761-596; 172-747-711-784-669; 186-646-547-409-28X; 193-761-582-495-002,2,true,cc-by,gold

The area of AI is an interdisciplinary field, which has been designated as a strategic area in the European Union (EU) approach and a key driver of economic development that can bring solutions to many social challenges and problems. Due to its nature and its tendency to be digitally advanced and smarter with analytics, the financial sector is one of the early adopters of AI and expects multiple benefits from its application, that is, the ability to provide better service in the shortest time possible and at a lower cost. AI in the financial sector is based on an understanding of the business needs of financial organizations, institutions and markets and the ability to connect with technological capabilities. They are powerful tools that completely transform this sector. The basic idea of this paper is to consider where the real value of AI in the financial sector is, i.e. what are the practical aspects and business implications of AI in the financial sector globally. It is common knowledge that evolving technologies have always had a strong impact on the sectors in which they are applied because they give them the opportunity to improve existing manufacturing processes, services, customer experiences, operate more efficiently, achieve cost savings, etc. The aim of this paper is to identify areas of application of AI in the financial sector, and to explore leading AI applications that are changing the financial ecosystem, transforming the financial sector and that have the potential to significantly improve many of its functions. The paper further highlights other implications of AI implementation in the financial sector such as employment - job creation and termination of existing AI-influenced employment, the scope and potential of application in developing countries, the problem of regulation and use in the best interests of man, and the importance of properly managing specific AI risks.",8,19,67,81,Finance; Human intelligence; Early adopter; Business; Artificial intelligence; Applications of artificial intelligence; Order (exchange); Common knowledge; European union; Service (economics); Analytics,,,,,https://www.bibliotekabijeljina.rs.ba/index.php/zrefis/article/view/6482 https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=828906 https://doisrpska.nub.rs/index.php/zrefis/article/download/6482/6351 https://doisrpska.nub.rs/index.php/zrefis/article/view/6482 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/287192453.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.7251/zrefis1919067g,,10.7251/zrefis1919067g,3006290725,,0,,3,true,,gold

The world of education must continue to innovate. Islamic boarding schools are educational institutions that combine religious learning with general education to instill intelligence, skills, good character, and moral values in students without drifting away from Islamic values. The 24-hour learning system is a source of student learning saturation. The approach used in carrying out active learning and fostering learning motivation is Ethno-STEM. A systematic literature review was conducted by documenting and reviewing all articles related to active learning for increasing learning motivation that were published in national and international accredited journals between 2018 and 2021, accessed from Science Direct, Google Scholar, SINTA, DOAJ, and lens.org. The results showed that the Ethno-STEM approach can effectively increase students’ learning motivation through active learning that stimulates students to improve their thinking skills, especially the critical, creative, innovative, and entrepreneurial characters.&#x0D;; Keywords: Ethno-STEM, interest in learning, the phenomenon of saturation, entrepreneurship character, boarding school</jats:p>",,,156,166,Phenomenon; Islam; Accreditation; Mathematics education; Psychology; Pedagogy; Character (mathematics); Motivation to learn; Entrepreneurship; Sociology,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.18502/kss.v7i10.11218,,10.18502/kss.v7i10.11218,,,0,,0,true,,gold
066-608-381-243-647,A Literature Review of the Challenges and Opportunities of the Transition from Industry 4.0 to Society 5.0,2022-08-28,2022,journal article,Energies,19961073,MDPI AG,Switzerland,Dimitris Mourtzis; John Angelopoulos; Nikos Panopoulos,"<jats:p>In the era of Industry 4.0, manufacturing and production systems were revolutionized by increasing operational efficiency and developing and implementing new business models, services, and products. Concretely, the milestone set for Industry 4.0 was to improve the sustainability and efficiency of production systems. By extension, the emphasis was focused on both the digitization and the digitalization of systems, providing room for further improvement. However, the current technological evolution is more system/machine-oriented, rather than human-oriented. Thus, several countries have begun orchestrating initiatives towards the design and development of the human-centric aspect of technologies, systems, and services, which has been coined as Industry 5.0. The impact of Industry 5.0 will extend to societal transformation, which eventually leads to the generation of a new society, the Society 5.0. The developments will be focused on the social and human-centric aspect of the tools and technologies introduced under the framework of Industry 4.0. Therefore, sustainability and human well-being will be at the heart of what comes next, the Industry 5.0, as a subset of Society 5.0. Industry 5.0 will build on the foundations laid during Industry 4.0 by emphasizing human-centered, resilient, and sustainable design. Consequently, the authors in this research work, through a critical literature review, aim to provide adequate reasoning for considering Industry 5.0 as a framework for enabling the coexistence of industry and emerging societal trends and needs. The contribution of this research work extends to the provision of a framework to facilitate the transition from Industry 4.0 to Society 5.0.</jats:p>",15,17,6276,6276,Industry 4.0; Milestone; Sustainability; Scope (computer science); Digitization; Emerging technologies; Work (physics); Engineering management; Engineering; Business; Management science,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15176276,,10.3390/en15176276,,,0,002-052-422-936-00X; 003-775-201-739-825; 004-970-916-760-02X; 006-420-918-875-724; 015-008-734-610-504; 016-245-823-947-788; 017-415-713-662-955; 020-916-140-650-888; 023-194-785-449-767; 027-194-470-119-742; 033-543-419-909-757; 046-446-925-840-307; 048-092-008-205-493; 048-840-098-633-459; 049-427-149-993-807; 056-892-778-681-803; 059-551-873-028-937; 062-757-415-379-846; 064-138-810-036-202; 064-330-779-044-975; 071-833-629-169-199; 072-397-415-406-687; 075-131-799-552-130; 077-112-920-752-951; 077-683-363-174-659; 081-144-427-432-971; 082-625-361-618-696; 094-374-698-201-994; 098-052-891-518-284; 099-373-385-765-024; 101-535-958-642-486; 102-165-762-216-574; 105-213-855-144-242; 112-781-611-772-743; 130-075-848-983-316; 130-076-441-971-473; 166-587-691-293-979; 166-708-559-622-171; 170-331-599-622-229; 170-563-722-411-658; 172-499-196-865-981; 179-742-231-200-830; 185-018-664-654-715,0,true,cc-by,gold

Along with this system transformation, the declining trend of labor number as world demographical change created demand for higher productivity worker, which is stronger and more versatile for handling more than one working station, giving added value and personalization in fulfilling customer needs. Assistive Technology (AT) which is formerly for disabled or handicapped people, would be more widely used for everyone and working for its new purposes in producing higher individual physical capacity. A common challenge of providing a wearable AT, such as limb prostheses, orthoses, or exoskeletons, is customizing their geometry to fit on user body parts. In Industrial context, this would even be more challenging since it must be provided in massive number which can overburden companies overhead. The disruptive technology of prototyping such as 3D scanning and 3D printing brings a customized prototype into a new level of accomplishment life cycle and affordability. New processing technology and material development in 3D printing eventually transform rapid prototyping into rapid manufacturing of final AT product. This paper aims to examine recent research and development of AT from AT developers and communities as well as its novel development process. The new challenges of new AT existence are discussed further in the context of working safety and product standardization and a study about its impacts towards industrial productivity are highlighted.",2217,1,030076,,Manufacturing engineering; Wearable computer; Personalization; Standardization; Context (language use); Rapid prototyping; Computer science; Process (engineering); Product (business); Added value,,,,,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/5.0000747 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AIPC.2217c0076P/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/5.0000747,,10.1063/5.0000747,3016329028,,0,000-029-747-488-93X; 003-491-882-161-760; 008-358-215-107-17X; 014-195-572-169-671; 014-936-799-072-255; 015-415-118-316-561; 017-171-481-610-946; 017-613-813-411-675; 018-320-786-083-22X; 022-325-921-145-671; 024-346-923-588-084; 024-524-650-441-114; 027-784-899-853-130; 035-401-195-104-659; 044-930-665-736-985; 045-824-573-006-43X; 047-974-872-654-388; 051-313-361-977-800; 051-408-537-160-071; 062-356-885-134-256; 072-454-600-705-767; 073-123-784-675-864; 073-187-559-908-126; 075-102-083-369-039; 075-560-780-377-091; 075-742-629-719-738; 077-725-458-611-893; 080-208-663-986-101; 086-884-917-693-643; 088-866-180-432-302; 096-181-218-719-121; 114-669-068-559-504; 126-742-751-222-184; 147-454-381-227-37X; 165-373-601-564-326; 185-124-562-126-312,2,false,,

In the study, digital twins are used as a basis in predictive analytics systems. The comparison of the current measurement information coming from the sensors with the results calculated in the digital twins of the equipment units provides identification of the current technical condition. In this chapter, we consider one of the possible approaches to implementing the architecture of a software product for building a digital model of a thermal power plant thermal circuit—the allocation of layers. It describes the advantages and disadvantages of this method in designing, changing the source program code, and correcting the internal structure of software—refactoring. The main advantage of the method is scalability since thermal circuits can contain a large number of pieces of equipment. A three-level architectural solution of the digital twin construction subsystem has been developed. A fragment of a database accumulating the required data for obtaining calculated data using a digital double of the thermal circuit of a power plant is presented. It also shows the implementation of one of the abstract layers of the architecture—the database management system layer. The obtained results allow us to assert the effectiveness of the layers method application for use as part of predictive analytics systems using the concept of the main and auxiliary equipment digital twins of energy facilities.KeywordsDigital twinSoftwareDatabaseModelingTPP equipmentLife cycle",,,239,249,Scalability; Computer science; Software; Analytics; Digital electronics,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-95112-2_20,,10.1007/978-3-030-95112-2_20,,,0,003-776-239-055-060; 008-324-232-240-137; 021-380-069-198-465; 027-904-325-809-089; 047-907-637-718-02X; 050-154-802-385-527; 055-165-270-740-692; 085-548-271-255-062; 109-963-395-691-437,0,false,,

Society 5.0 offers a human-centered society that makes a balance between economic progress and the resolution of social problems through a system that is highly connected through cyberspace and the real world. If society 4.0 allows anyone to access also share information on the internet. Society 5.0 is an era where all technology is part of humanity itself. To take advantage of opportunities and answer the challenges of the industrial revolution 4.0, Indonesian people in particular are required to have data, technology and human literacy capabilities. Data literacy is needed by HR to improve skills in processing and analyzing big data for the benefit of improving public and business services. Technology literacy shows the ability to utilize digital technology to process data and information, while human literacy must be mastered because it shows the element of soft skills or the development of individual character to be able to collaborate, be adaptive, and innovative. Indonesia is demanded to be able to follow industry 4.0 workflows juxtaposed with society 5.0. The need for human resources in several business fields is still very massive if all of them are carried out by robotics.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is central to this change and offers major opportunities to improve our lives. The recent developments in AI are the result of increased processing power, improvements in algorithms and the exponential growth in the volume and variety of digital data. Many applications of AI have started entering into our every-day lives, from machine translations, to image recognition, and music generation, and are increasingly deployed in industry, government, and commerce. Connected and autonomous vehicles, and AI-supported medical diagnostics are areas of application that will soon be commonplace. There is strong global competition on AI among the US, China, and Europe. The US leads for now but China is catching up fast and aims to lead by 2030. For the EU, it is not so much a question of winning or losing a race but of finding the way of embracing the opportunities offered by AI in a way that is human-centred, ethical, secure, and true to our core values. The EU Member States and the European Commission are developing coordinated national and European strategies, recognising that only together we can succeed. We can build on our areas of strength including excellent research, leadership in some industrial sectors like automotive and robotics, a solid legal and regulatory framework, and very rich cultural diversity also at regional and sub-regional levels. It is generally recognised that AI can flourish only if supported by a robust computing infrastructure and good quality data: • With respect to computing, we identified a window of opportunity for Europe to invest in the emerging new paradigm of computing distributed towards the edges of the network, in addition to centralised facilities. This will support also the future deployment of 5G and the Internet of Things. • With respect to data, we argue in favour of learning from successful Internet companies, opening access to data and developing interactivity with the users rather than just broadcasting data. In this way, we can develop ecosystems of public administrations, firms, and civil society enriching the data to make it fit for AI applications responding to European needs. We should embrace the opportunities afforded by AI but not uncritically. The black box characteristics of most leading AI techniques make them opaque even to specialists. AI systems are currently limited to narrow and well-defined tasks, and their technologies inherit imperfections from their human creators, such as the well-recognised bias effect present in data. We should challenge the shortcomings of AI and work towards strong evaluation strategies, transparent and reliable systems, and good human-AI interactions. Ethical and secure-by-design algorithms are crucial to build trust in this disruptive technology, but we also need a broader engagement of civil society on the values to be embedded in AI and the directions for future development. This social engagement should be part of the effort to strengthen our resilience at all levels from local, to national and European, across institutions, industry and civil society. Developing local ecosystems of skills, computing, data, and applications can foster the engagement of local communities, respond to their needs, harness local creativity and knowledge, and build a human-centred, diverse, and socially driven AI. We still know very little about how AI will impact the way we think, make decisions, relate to each other, and how it will affect our jobs. This uncertainty can be a source of concern but is also a sign of opportunity. The future is not yet written. We can shape it based on our collective vision of what future we would like to have. But we need to act together and act fast.",,,,,The Internet; Variety (cybernetics); Psychological resilience; Business; Interactivity; Government; Artificial intelligence; Applications of artificial intelligence; Civil society; Social engagement,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:ipt:iptwpa:jrc113826 https://ideas.repec.org/p/ipt/iptwpa/jrc113826.html https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC113826 https://core.ac.uk/download/162257245.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2760/11251,,10.2760/11251,2908425202,,0,,38,true,,green

After evaluating the current trends of advancement in the fields of IoT, IoE and IoNT, this paper identifies the 21 most significant current and future challenges as well as scenarios for the possible future expansion of their applications. Despite possible negative aspects of these developments, there are grounds for general optimism about the coming technologies. Certainly, many tedious tasks can be taken over by IoT devices.

Hennerici; Emmanuel Andrès,"Are new technologies in the medicine sector a driver to support the development of a society 5.0? Innovation pushes the artisan to become smart and lean, customer-oriented but within a standardized environment of production, maintaining and ensuring the quality of the product. An artisan is a user and innovator, as an essential part of the industrial chain. In the healthcare sector, the doctor is the industrial artisan, and medicine can be considered as an example of a smart tool, strongly tailored, that embeds the innovation of materials, nano-devices, and smart technology (e.g., sensors and controllers). But how much of society is ready to host smart technology “on board”, becoming “on life”, constantly connected with remote controls that allow us to monitor, gather data, and, in any case, act, with preventive healthcare solutions? After a short overview of the medicine sector, a preliminary, tentative link between technological innovation and the healthcare sector allows us to adopt several outlooks on how to change research, always more transdisciplinary, combining science with social science in order to remain human-centered.",9,7,2198,,Engineering management; Health care; Order (exchange); Host (network); Emerging technologies; Production (economics); Quality (business); Product (business); Preventive healthcare; Medicine,Covid-19; emerging technology; medicine 4.0; society 5.0,,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32664634/ https://www.scilit.net/article/b5e540398f31c162acc8170474e9fcb1?action=show-references https://doaj.org/article/291827b35f4349c99f118a50b1bdc49c https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/9/7/2198/pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7408705 https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/9/7/2198,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jcm9072198,32664634,10.3390/jcm9072198,3042160828,PMC7408705,0,003-050-393-792-576; 010-987-924-507-516; 026-125-135-981-786; 032-899-521-466-690; 063-139-964-133-898; 093-582-955-128-653; 101-521-492-903-885; 104-645-510-450-546; 110-213-454-862-471; 130-743-410-417-302; 135-089-679-489-26X,10,true,cc-by,gold

Although industry 5.0 can revolutionize the landscape of goods production, still its adoption is in the infancy stage. Hence, the purpose of this article is to examine barriers that impede the adoption of industry 5.0, and to propose solution initiatives (SIs). After an in-depth literature review and interviews with German industry experts in pharmaceutical sector, barriers and SIs are ranked using an integrated Analytical hierarchy process-elimination and choice expressing reality-decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (AHP-ELECTRE-DEMATEL) approach. “Linking virtual reality and reality” is found to be the most critical deterrent to the adoption of industry 5.0, and falls into a causal group, which signifies their influence on other deterrents. “Measures for better connectivity with patients” is of utmost importance for German firms to ensure secure communication and safeguard patient data. The findings also highlight the problems with the adoption of high-tech innovations due to lack of standardization and fair benchmarking policies on industry 5.0. This article concludes by proposing an industry 5.0 framework. The inhibitors to adopting industry 5.0 were investigated in this article, the results of which will assist practitioners and decision makers to understand the issues with industry 5.0. The results of this article will help potential adopters of this technology to look for the SIs. This will therefore pave the path for effective adoption of industry 5.0 across the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector.",,,1,18,Production (economics); Business; Benchmarking; Pharmaceutical industry; Standardization; Analytic hierarchy process; Industrial organization; Marketing; Process management; Knowledge management,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tem.2022.3143466,,10.1109/tem.2022.3143466,,,0,,3,false,,

In manufacturing sectors, technology development has been divided into different time zones (Industry 1.0–4.0). These industrial upheavals have highly focused on technology applications. But modern challenges of customization, personalization and technology upgrading can only be done by human involvement. These modern challenges have led to new industrial revolution called “Industry 5.0,” which emphasizes on technology advancement with human empowerment. In this research paper, authors have studied the enablers, which help in execution of Industry 5.0 in Indian manufacturing sector.

F. Moller; Hamid Vakilzadian; Roland E. Haas,"In the past, manufacturing equipment was instrumented hard-wired. Industrial equipment such as sensors, controllers, and others are expensive, and upgrading manufacturing equipment in existing facilities is costly. The growing use of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven cost reductions in sensors, controllers, and communications through high volumes of digital devices and value-added components. The manufacturing sector with its massive installed base of legacy equipment has also become an area of interest for the advances in innovative digital technologies. Meanwhile, the next level of innovation in manufacturing has been achieved, labeled by the term 4th Industrial Revolution, in short Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 takes the automation of manufacturing processes to a new level by introducing customized and intelligent production technologies. Machines are connected and communicate with each other to ultimately make decisions, operate independently, or cooperate with humans in a customer-oriented production environment. This raises the question about the key issues of the next industrial enhancement and the term to call it? The change from Industry 4.0 to the next innovative industrial enhancement is termed Industry 5.0. However, Industry 5.0 has its root in the concept of Industry 4.0. Thus, the key issues of the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 can be seen in the goal of making manufacturability sustainable from economic, ecologic and societal perspectives. This requires building a circular economy with a focus on a human centric industry. The paper describes the development from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0.",,,,,Industry 4.0; Manufacturing; Automation; Manufacturing engineering; Key (lock); Advanced manufacturing; Production (economics); Business; Computer science; Telecommunications; Engineering,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/eit53891.2022.9813831,,10.1109/eit53891.2022.9813831,,,0,010-812-963-476-180; 040-443-612-123-92X; 063-060-058-326-557; 064-042-765-914-689; 075-865-964-374-597; 081-027-212-356-307; 096-202-884-973-236; 128-458-493-080-05X; 137-616-902-479-676,0,false,,

Ng,"• A real assembly line balancing problem with human-robot collaboration is studied. • A new MILP model is proposed for the problem. • An adaptive SA algorithm is proposed with customized characteristics. • The SA’s performance is validated in real-world cases from the automotive industry. In light of the Industry 5.0 trend towards human-centric and resilient industries, human-robot collaboration (HRC) assembly lines can be used to enhance productivity and workers’ well-being, provided that the optimal allocation of tasks and available resources can be determined. This study investigates the assembly line balancing problem (ALBP), considering HRC. This problem, abbreviated ALBP-HRC, arises in advanced manufacturing systems, where humans and collaborative robots share the same workplace and can simultaneously perform tasks in parallel or in collaboration. Driven by the need to solve the more complex assembly line-balancing problems found in the automotive industry, this study aims to address the ALBP-HRC with the cycle time and the number of operators (humans and robots) as the primary and secondary objective, respectively. In addition to the traditional ALBP constraints, the human and robot characteristics, in terms of task times, allowing multiple humans and robots at stations, and their joint/collaborative tasks are formulated into a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. A neighborhood-search simulated annealing (SA) is proposed with customized solution representation and neighborhood search operators designed to fit into the problem characteristics. Furthermore, the proposed SA features an adaptive neighborhood selection mechanism that enables the SA to utilize its exploration history to dynamically choose appropriate neighborhood operators as the search evolves. The proposed MILP and SA are implemented on real cases taken from the automotive industry where stations are designed for HRC. The computational results over different problems show that the adaptive SA produces promising solutions compared to the MILP and other swarm intelligence algorithms, namely genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and artificial bee colony. The comparisons of human/robot versus HRC settings in the case study indicate significant improvement in the productivity of the assembly line when multiple humans and robots with collaborative tasks are permissible at stations.",140,,105674,105674,Automotive industry; Robot; Computer science; Scheduling (production processes); Assembly line; Simulated annealing; Integer programming; Job shop scheduling; Task (project management); Linear programming; Distributed computing; Mathematical optimization,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2021.105674,,10.1016/j.cor.2021.105674,,,0,010-979-271-512-130; 015-367-986-031-722; 024-216-245-257-511; 027-856-581-580-38X; 030-566-679-640-830; 031-964-765-251-399; 036-012-008-162-747; 038-024-031-051-894; 039-773-190-077-869; 049-816-999-056-296; 058-988-530-350-110; 059-514-085-671-822; 059-739-775-031-555; 092-214-794-270-804; 099-747-298-582-08X; 110-432-942-745-346; 128-275-436-645-171; 150-106-755-118-790,7,true,cc-by,hybrid

Huang,"Benefiting from the marriage of just-in-time (JIT) and computer integrated manufacturing (CIM), a series of manufacturing planning and control (MPC) systems has been introduced for contemporary production and operations management. However, the increasing requirements for customized and personalized products and services, together with the acceleration of the socio-economic environment in the age of Industry 4.0, forced manufacturers to re-evaluate their current MPC strategies that mainly emphasize time, cost and quality priorities. Industry 4.0 presents a solid ambition for transforming to a digital, data-driven and interconnected manufacturing industry centred around cyber-physical convergence. Although the relevance of Industry 4.0 technologies’ disruptions on operations management has been acknowledged, a significant gap in the evolution of the logic and design of MPC systems has been observed. The requirements of on-demand products and services with enhanced flexibility, resilience, sustainability and humanitarianism in this new industrial revolution call for innovations of MPC architectures and approaches. This paper first summarizes the evolution of MPC systems with enabling technologies and the changing business climate at that time. To explore innovative MPC that complies with the increasing economic, social and environmental requirements, the concept of synchronization-oriented MPC with four principles is proposed. Following the principles, a general framework for the synchronization-oriented MPC with enhanced economic, social and environmental benefits is developed. This work potentially provides insights into innovative MPC in the age of Industry 4.0 and even Industry 5.0.",55,2,163,168,Flexibility (engineering); Industry 4.0; Synchronization (alternating current); Sustainability; Quality (philosophy); Computer science; Business; Risk analysis (engineering),,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2022.04.187,,10.1016/j.ifacol.2022.04.187,,,0,001-011-892-665-374; 001-103-459-836-919; 001-758-579-687-388; 009-980-090-585-966; 012-218-887-216-344; 013-209-041-019-592; 014-796-353-623-217; 020-627-235-778-998; 036-379-622-440-373; 038-905-048-579-484; 044-826-117-182-379; 045-936-475-493-242; 054-566-657-836-198; 055-185-113-498-458; 057-335-032-266-130; 059-424-427-267-469; 064-138-810-036-202; 082-140-051-993-161; 085-056-385-382-296; 095-366-405-250-466; 102-087-824-667-717; 114-257-960-475-300; 121-189-721-254-131; 126-126-765-625-33X; 129-461-000-946-008,2,true,,gold

These solutions are commonly built on digital twins, i.e., comprehensive, structured and effective digital representations of the production system and its entities, whose current status is constantly updated by the plugged data sources. The arising of the Industry 5.0 paradigm and the established key role of workers in manufacturing require new Digital Twins to represent also humans. In fact, as cognitive automation becomes more and more pervasive and its behaviour unintelligible to humans, it becomes essential for improving performance and well-being, at the same time, to model humans as data-driven agents and to represent their interaction with the factory systems. Currently, a standardised solution for creating Digital Twins is missing, forcing industrial solution architects to resort to ad-hoc implementations and models. These solutions lack re-usability, scalability and extensibility, preventing the introduction of a human digital representation in existent twins, so hindering the complete shift to the new Industry 5.0 paradigm. In this paper, such limitations are faced by introducing an extensible and flexible IIoT-industrial internet of things-based platform with a twofold benefit: on the one hand, to support the creation of customised data representations of production systems and their entities including humans; on the other hand, to provide a modular infrastructure, along with its interchangeable components, for easy digital twin instantiation and ramp-up. An implementation of the platform has been tested with different applications in a laboratory setting and released as a public resource. Finally, potential future applications of the proposed digital twin are discussed, highlighting its main benefits.",107,,661,667,Computer science; Implementation; Modular design; Scalability; Factory (object-oriented programming); Industry 4.0; Context (archaeology); Automation; Usability; USable; Data science; Software engineering; Distributed computing,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2022.05.042,,10.1016/j.procir.2022.05.042,,,0,002-599-460-164-388; 006-824-466-671-376; 009-196-394-593-472; 009-683-959-159-971; 012-302-514-956-35X; 013-007-720-642-102; 015-228-799-602-614; 017-415-713-662-955; 019-768-331-540-502; 028-466-048-018-180; 047-436-453-460-898; 068-775-721-617-07X; 083-138-344-350-817; 085-466-022-073-007; 094-019-771-819-795; 096-017-941-794-37X; 117-587-846-748-601; 127-046-613-305-747; 129-461-404-099-044; 131-206-117-846-231,0,true,,gold

Interfaces to digital twins are projected to go beyond physical representations to become blueprints for the actual “objects” and an active dashboard for their control. The role and importance of real-time interactive animations presented in an Extended Reality (XR) format will be explored. The need for using game engines, particularly their physics engines and AI within interactive simulated Extended Reality is expanded on. Importing and scanning real-world environments is assumed to become more efficient when using AR. Exporting to VR and AR is recommended to be a default feature. A technology framework for the next generation simulators is presented along with a proposed set of implementation guidelines. The need for more human centric technology approaches, nascent in Industry 4.0, are now central to the emerging Industry 5.0 paradigm; an agenda that is discussed in this research as part of a human in the loop future, supported by DES. The potential role of Explainable Artificial Intelligence is also explored along with an audit trail approach to provide a justification of complex and automated decision-making systems with relation to DES.

Recent years have indeed assisted in drawing attention to the human-centric design of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) and to the genesis of the ‘Operator 4.0’, two novel concepts that raise significant ethical questions regarding the impact of technology on workers and society at large. This paper argues that a value-oriented and ethical technology engineering in Industry 5.0 is an urgent and sensitive topic as demonstrated by a survey administered to industry leaders from different companies. The Value Sensitive Design (VSD) approach is proposed as a principled framework to illustrate how technologies enabling human–machine symbiosis in the Factory of the Future can be designed to embody elicited human values and to illustrate actionable steps that engineers and designers can take in their design projects. Use cases based on real solutions and prototypes discuss how a design-for-values approach aids in the investigation and mitigation of ethical issues emerging from the implementation of technological solutions and, hence, support the migration to a symbiotic Factory of the Future.",10,12,1,25,Engineering management; Engineering; Situated; Work (electrical); Value (ethics); Industry 4.0; Production (economics); Value sensitive design; Use case; Factory (object-oriented programming),,,,,https://iris.unito.it/bitstream/2318/1741791/1/applsci-10-04182.pdf https://iris.unito.it/handle/2318/1741791 https://philpapers.org/rec/LONVAE https://research.tudelft.nl/en/publications/value-oriented-and-ethical-technology-engineering-in-industry-50- https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/12/4182/pdf https://iris.unical.it/handle/20.500.11770/317633 https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/12/4182/htm https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/326909057.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app10124182,,10.3390/app10124182,3036816925,,0,000-069-943-339-065; 003-098-121-921-779; 005-988-234-681-537; 015-750-890-950-793; 015-896-365-180-470; 016-131-629-212-360; 018-204-409-632-280; 022-001-976-911-088; 025-370-045-015-261; 030-538-455-823-808; 040-192-597-123-492; 046-744-066-303-436; 047-344-167-153-151; 049-816-999-056-296; 053-530-162-809-509; 058-047-952-980-10X; 060-262-622-370-337; 065-513-914-579-314; 065-934-347-978-866; 067-193-950-421-226; 071-366-058-731-140; 073-439-602-104-579; 081-480-253-364-624; 085-371-017-012-953; 088-362-827-564-703; 089-002-311-968-886; 090-864-273-291-919; 091-910-554-720-952; 091-928-035-899-634; 097-680-341-242-51X; 101-535-958-642-486; 104-547-438-104-462; 113-262-515-060-959; 120-329-562-811-556; 125-795-343-058-314; 173-954-144-095-944,78,true,cc-by,gold

A deep look at disruptive technology and innovation in retail highlights the diversity of the future of food safety technology. Food systems and food supply chains (FSCs) have undergone significant changes in their operations and structure over the last decade as globalization expands both food choice and availability. As FSCs lengthen, and food passes through extended trading relationships, transparency on food origins, methods of cultivation, harvest, processing as well as labor conditions and sustainability are reduced, along with food trust. Moreover, while the rapid pace of technology innovation benefits FSCs, we are witness to the usage of social media platforms by citizen-consumers to amplify the rhetoric related to recurring incidents and crises in food quality, food safety, food fraud, food security, sustainability, and other ethical lapses. Furthermore, we are witness to new evidence on the global burden of foodborne diseases, including noncommunicable diseases that range from severe malnutrition to morbid obesity and from severe illnesses requiring hospitalization to mortality. The World Health Organization claims that 31 foodborne hazards cause 600 million illnesses and 420,000 deaths annually. Overcoming these challenges requires a holistic reframing of our food systems and societal challenges. The emergence of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provides an overarching framework for collaboration and alignment. Japan has put forward a vision for a human-centric, technology-enabled future branded as “Society 5.0.” Increasingly, the redesign of FSCs necessitates a concerted, multistakeholder effort and the development of digitization strategies in order to cope with the evolution toward the vision of Society 5.0 and to achieve the UN SDGs.",,,1,42,Business; Marketing; Food choice; Globalization; Food industry; Food safety; Food security; Sustainable development; Sustainability; Food systems,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128189566000014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128189566000014,,,3041301066,,0,,0,false,,

The product lifecycle has been shortened dramatically, and the manufacturing industry is moving from mass production to the high personalization of mass products. This era is widely known as the fourth industrial revolution or Industry 4.0 (I4.0). It seems that soon it will be inevitable for every society. The paper briefly focuses on empirical insights into the impact of I4.0 on various sectors of society. The traditional approaches to manufacturing, servicing, and public policy planning will no longer remain effective and would be transformed. I4.0 should be observed as an Opportunity 4.0 and draw attention to the industry, academia, and policymakers’ in changing scenarios. Expectations from them are also underlined. Its favorable features in the post-COVID-19 era are also discussed. This short article invites attention to foresee beyond I4.0, e.g. Industry 5.0 and more such progressions. </jats:p>",,,,,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); Virology,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/s2424862222500129,,10.1142/s2424862222500129,,,0,001-294-103-884-762; 002-080-619-054-658; 004-771-471-010-549; 008-273-255-136-124; 010-491-668-935-335; 016-819-194-616-838; 017-415-713-662-955; 018-765-644-135-831; 019-219-882-433-111; 023-205-314-705-315; 023-957-604-328-062; 025-042-876-675-970; 025-131-859-546-629; 028-232-581-949-707; 033-645-147-890-403; 036-652-321-315-178; 036-663-344-685-634; 038-904-037-813-023; 040-532-370-874-177; 040-778-348-220-273; 041-437-717-635-476; 042-611-611-135-403; 048-038-873-341-337; 049-655-180-277-678; 052-975-240-408-918; 057-214-042-880-707; 064-571-314-497-250; 064-914-878-452-615; 074-895-567-621-479; 081-251-314-275-707; 088-589-063-696-437; 091-620-396-383-798; 094-019-771-819-795; 096-994-446-032-91X; 108-969-550-365-174; 109-440-039-575-621; 113-767-551-070-365; 116-962-226-076-678; 119-806-532-860-262; 127-157-823-317-473; 144-212-810-500-469; 145-595-525-463-870; 161-505-884-447-010; 175-121-540-436-380; 175-819-230-922-230,0,false,,

At the same time, wireless communications are becoming crucial to smart manufacturing within the scope of Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 is a developing trend of high-speed data exchange in automation for manufacturing technologies and is referred to as the fourth industrial revolution. This trend requires fast, reliable, low-latency, and cost-effective data transmissions with fast synchronizations to ensure smooth operations for various processes. VLC is capable of providing reliable, low-latency, and secure connections that do not penetrate walls and is immune to electromagnetic interference. As such, this paper aims to show the potential of VLC for industrial wireless applications by examining the latest research work in VLC systems. This work also highlights and classifies challenges that might arise with the applicability of VLC and visible light positioning (VLP) systems in these settings. Given the previous work performed in these areas, and the major ongoing experimental projects looking into the use of VLC systems for industrial applications, the use of VLC and VLP systems for industrial applications shows promising potential.",9,12,2157,,Automation; Visible light communication; Electromagnetic interference; Scope (project management); Optical wireless; Computer science; Wireless; Information and Communications Technology; Telecommunications,,,,Horizon 2020,https://northumbria-test.eprints-hosting.org/id/document/273257 https://researchportal.northumbria.ac.uk/en/publications/visible-light-communications-for-industrial-applicationschallenge https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/9/12/2157/htm https://researchportal.northumbria.ac.uk/files/39897729/electronics-09-02157-v2.pdf https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/9/12/2157/pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/362990839.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics9122157,,10.3390/electronics9122157,3111288590,,0,001-295-302-541-978; 003-886-937-447-317; 005-585-755-143-674; 005-689-703-408-42X; 005-771-884-036-815; 006-907-893-118-878; 007-888-301-193-264; 008-023-963-020-411; 008-404-008-444-741; 009-581-709-682-623; 010-396-993-255-776; 010-402-738-806-583; 010-795-135-653-194; 011-077-825-505-973; 011-129-645-989-095; 011-843-051-919-047; 011-973-514-614-633; 013-853-095-137-591; 013-965-875-718-449; 014-014-100-814-024; 015-946-094-673-240; 016-402-490-651-722; 016-726-296-395-703; 017-415-713-662-955; 017-444-483-537-210; 017-922-771-237-988; 018-488-841-195-734; 019-739-439-041-454; 020-017-449-802-57X; 020-307-435-710-370; 020-580-113-023-145; 021-005-776-117-236; 022-011-600-040-906; 023-465-146-409-373; 023-914-675-223-145; 024-494-138-301-185; 024-990-668-392-208; 025-766-059-123-950; 026-380-570-072-673; 027-075-527-335-082; 028-174-739-162-216; 028-398-382-996-383; 028-573-718-470-621; 029-004-154-037-449; 029-621-538-666-870; 031-203-476-634-370; 031-721-655-733-278; 032-147-915-194-139; 032-657-638-942-783; 032-735-102-772-529; 033-244-426-609-541; 033-274-213-180-662; 033-320-841-894-978; 034-499-768-608-048; 035-553-466-535-243; 035-835-295-750-12X; 036-055-465-565-824; 036-819-217-681-84X; 037-486-070-555-999; 037-568-618-992-449; 038-270-546-991-109; 038-406-633-043-713; 040-389-188-043-204; 041-822-593-755-273; 041-999-636-043-158; 042-452-316-634-087; 043-455-992-944-005; 044-642-569-456-565; 044-877-012-478-835; 046-917-117-499-591; 048-152-610-866-747; 049-038-507-010-526; 049-583-774-399-293; 050-188-425-306-912; 050-997-950-548-215; 052-484-611-263-265; 053-289-666-047-677; 053-306-661-254-249; 054-324-922-995-682; 055-587-987-189-48X; 055-842-833-383-71X; 056-257-301-645-888; 056-685-037-542-804; 057-298-631-130-665; 058-693-555-538-891; 058-819-526-264-677; 059-263-707-236-611; 059-325-602-164-560; 059-345-031-889-346; 059-674-482-572-695; 060-129-342-788-365; 060-683-016-918-134; 062-232-255-022-28X; 062-716-279-884-491; 062-737-639-449-884; 062-760-407-185-74X; 065-743-962-266-965; 066-619-120-842-995; 067-692-253-332-785; 068-338-686-818-638; 068-645-611-992-623; 069-152-587-871-602; 069-236-662-292-167; 069-407-228-070-354; 069-950-521-975-675; 070-539-498-378-711; 072-357-998-469-56X; 072-603-156-089-465; 072-748-467-775-013; 073-192-731-763-114; 073-506-539-317-607; 073-963-217-245-384; 074-756-556-757-709; 075-132-515-900-573; 075-467-201-498-387; 076-072-873-565-570; 077-356-972-249-89X; 078-651-219-450-33X; 078-697-448-069-931; 082-661-955-585-527; 082-947-153-132-378; 083-201-456-373-190; 083-371-330-948-237; 083-579-385-490-828; 083-769-842-199-460; 084-187-176-729-859; 085-687-301-980-418; 085-793-760-767-818; 085-840-254-001-181; 086-959-572-774-395; 087-848-994-153-796; 088-818-412-419-865; 089-663-594-943-766; 089-801-955-872-602; 089-865-246-285-803; 090-540-000-860-441; 092-323-231-992-742; 094-976-416-538-58X; 098-952-889-146-868; 101-856-080-590-450; 102-424-326-687-39X; 103-001-104-183-489; 107-271-047-139-371; 108-275-468-824-654; 110-351-248-381-453; 110-550-134-896-856; 110-641-472-718-749; 112-553-229-487-891; 114-762-342-801-225; 116-334-056-876-594; 116-438-947-818-44X; 117-964-265-984-893; 119-677-215-435-029; 120-902-340-205-509; 122-525-990-773-171; 123-167-066-993-012; 123-894-479-808-509; 124-479-806-648-37X; 126-954-921-857-022; 130-103-712-690-376; 132-589-810-351-496; 134-597-731-467-354; 136-815-595-063-560; 137-042-125-417-285; 139-696-665-502-507; 141-320-979-384-896; 142-767-569-842-150; 149-123-179-326-688; 150-777-956-906-301; 151-285-189-365-510; 152-826-577-650-079; 154-123-663-400-676; 154-422-125-418-73X; 158-833-011-569-136; 158-906-834-532-347; 158-977-045-181-255; 160-801-734-658-437; 161-000-456-671-792; 169-866-362-853-315; 170-061-625-445-549; 172-795-633-788-475; 176-583-439-390-018; 189-802-340-166-39X; 193-311-056-197-816,21,true,cc-by,gold

Patil; Nancy P. Ambritta; Parikshit N. Mahalle; Nilanjan Dey,"Advancements in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) makes CPSs essential entities in society today, and have made them prominent across all fields. For example, the healthcare industry has evolved technologically and has effectively incorporated CPS into many application areas. While these advancements, involving Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS), have been revised according to Society 4.0, there are still issues that need to be considered while we transition from an information-based society (Society 4.0) to a human-centric society (Society 5.0). In this paper, we propose an MCPS framework for Society 5.0 in the context of some state-of-the-art technologies. The proposed system focuses on enhancing security aspects of Society 5.0 through introduction of a Security Layer equipped with protocols such as Open Authorization (OAuth), User-Managed Access (UMA), and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). The added security layer is designed to incorporate country-specific security laws. Challenges and design issues in developing a trusted and secure service for MCPS are also discussed using vulnerability assessment and attack modeling. Finally, we discuss ethical aspects that need to be addressed in the transition from Society 4.0 to Society 5.0.",3,3,189,198,Computer security; Vulnerability (computing); Context (archaeology); Authorization; Sovereignty; Cyber-physical system; Computer science; Information society; Internet privacy,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tts.2022.3185396,,10.1109/tts.2022.3185396,,,0,003-474-543-328-584; 006-392-689-117-173; 007-803-279-251-628; 009-243-369-296-061; 011-483-437-055-775; 012-411-356-607-228; 015-724-536-917-289; 015-793-586-652-636; 026-286-236-480-873; 028-171-774-640-11X; 029-543-754-643-04X; 030-930-368-478-571; 032-077-875-184-962; 032-808-962-956-12X; 035-525-714-919-038; 038-061-528-547-134; 039-057-730-373-080; 045-007-244-458-590; 047-290-850-488-086; 049-751-437-769-230; 051-513-064-534-401; 053-278-265-950-992; 065-395-818-630-920; 068-898-060-951-774; 076-049-867-290-165; 089-191-811-508-961; 095-732-657-525-582; 096-431-742-585-827; 106-675-372-105-778; 116-393-158-701-648; 117-086-070-434-238; 123-676-499-502-51X; 126-124-639-115-057; 129-773-604-407-083; 140-530-938-944-307; 164-744-353-821-269; 170-563-722-411-658; 172-815-455-393-416; 173-923-404-057-150; 174-444-888-927-391,0,false,,

This article also presents several studies from the online journal article and the findings of previous research from thesis and dissertations and textbooks relating to the theory of blended learning. As an effort to reformulate PAI learning, it is important to implement blended learning in the current digital era. Islamic religious education has a material source that is extensive and strategic for the progress of the Indonesian nation. With most Indonesia's population is the follower of Islam, Islamic religious education as millennial generation literacy is appropriate to be formulated under the development of digital technology. Islamic education can take a strategic role as the immunization of the young generation amidst the advancement of learning and innovation. Blended learning is one of them in future learning. Blended learning is one of the latest learning models that has been successfully applied to educational institutions. This study describes blended learning as an effort to reformulate PAI learning in the digital era 4.0. This study also aims to be a reference for further research. This research was conducted with the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method of various research findings and the findings of journal articles relating to the blended learning. The findings of the study showed that the principle of blended learning synergize a balanced combination between face-to-face and online learning. It can apply blended learning to PAI learning and is quite successful. Using technology will strengthen the conventional methods that commonly occur in PAI learning so that PAI learning is more effective and efficient. Some research states that blended learning has motivated students in learning, enables students to be more creative, more active, more participatory, more communicative, independent and able to solve problems in learning, improving learning outcomes.

These core values will give spirit or motivation to everyone in the organization and finally to the community in growing a human-centered monotheistic society 5.0. This article aimed to examine the phases of implementing the Islamic value-based HR Model in companies. The model used was the HR model with Islamic values and the meaning of prayer, as well as a harmonious corporate culture, resulting in the expected HR performance. This study used qualitative research methods with the object of research are two companies that have implemented Islamic values in managing the company. The technique of collecting data was triangulation, namely research instrument,  in-depth interviews and secondary data analysis. Data analysis was inductive. The application of the Islamic value-based HR model goes through two phases, namely the ""Mecca"" phase and the ""Medina"" phase. Companies in the Mecca phase need to consistently carry out an integrated corporate culture internalization program, namely as values, decision-making patterns and attitudes. Internalization of culture by using Islamic values and the meaning of prayer to influence at the individual level, work units and companies in general can open hearts, minds and wills so that job satisfaction and employee commitment can be achieved. Companies in the Medina phase have shared values that have been entrenched and internalized which have an influence on HR performance. With the company's rapid development, culture as identity; fastener; a source of inspiration, pride and resources; driving force and as a pattern of behavior needs to be maintained and passed on to the next generation. </jats:p>",1,1,28,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.56174/pjieb.v1i1.6,,10.56174/pjieb.v1i1.6,,,0,,0,false,,

148-063-470-925-522,Digital transformation of peatland eco-innovations ('Paludiculture'): Enabling a paradigm shift towards the real-time sustainable production of 'green-friendly' products and services.,2022-05-29,2022,journal article,The Science of the total environment,18791026; 00489697,Elsevier,Netherlands,Neil J Rowan; Niall Murray; Yuansong Qiao; E O'Neill; Eoghan Clifford; Damià Barceló; Deborah M Power,"The world is heading in the wrong direction on carbon emissions where we are not on track to limit global warming to 1.5 °C; Ireland is among the countries where overall emissions have continued to rise. The development of wettable peatland products and services (termed 'Paludiculture') present significant opportunities for enabling a transition away from peat-harvesting (fossil fuels) to developing 'green' eco-innovations. However, this must be balanced with sustainable carbon sequestration and environmental protection. This complex transition from 'brown to green' must be met in real time by enabling digital technologies across the full value chain. This will potentially necessitate creation of new green-business models with the potential to support disruptive innovation. This timely paper describes digital transformation of paludiculture-based eco-innovation that will potentially lead to a paradigm shift towards using smart digital technologies to address efficiency of products and services along with future-proofing for climate change. Digital transform of paludiculture also aligns with the 'Industry 5.0 - a human-centric solution'. However, companies supporting peatland innovation may lack necessary standards, data-sharing or capabilities that can also affect viable business model propositions that can jeopardize economic, political and social sustainability. Digital solutions may reduce costs, increase productivity, improve produce develop, and achieve faster time to market for paludiculture. Digitisation also enables information systems to be open, interoperable, and user-friendly. This constitutes the first study to describe the digital transformation of paludiculture, both vertically and horizontally, in order to inform sustainability that includes process automation via AI, machine learning, IoT-Cloud informed sensors and robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and blockchain for cyber-physical systems. Thus, the aim of this paper is to describe the applicability of digital transformation to actualize the benefits and opportunities of paludiculture activities and enterprises in the Irish midlands with a global orientation.",838,Pt 3,156328,156328,Sustainability; Interoperability; Paradigm shift; Greenhouse gas; Digital transformation; Environmental economics; Digital Revolution; Business,Climate change; Digital transformation; Disruption; Natural-based solutions; Peatlands; Sustainability innovation,Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Humans; Industry; Soil,Soil,Interreg Europe,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156328,35649452,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156328,,,0,000-199-440-246-890; 003-077-460-637-876; 003-221-940-874-540; 003-734-508-497-153; 004-035-208-237-513; 004-052-595-749-061; 005-656-370-316-138; 006-115-631-054-389; 009-853-404-769-548; 010-236-953-800-634; 014-230-429-366-446; 015-481-960-493-901; 015-938-864-684-190; 017-415-713-662-955; 017-885-877-239-033; 018-291-306-971-771; 020-825-438-669-588; 021-691-489-511-284; 022-521-555-821-286; 023-701-350-507-394; 024-494-874-340-457; 024-716-790-722-969; 025-400-859-604-422; 026-084-858-769-529; 026-095-956-825-372; 026-408-094-586-607; 028-441-642-703-163; 028-809-165-996-938; 037-659-121-714-391; 037-833-584-977-519; 041-469-728-502-229; 041-892-211-741-41X; 042-096-056-677-25X; 046-562-542-091-52X; 051-497-678-798-076; 051-885-971-789-026; 052-591-552-841-013; 052-645-170-849-539; 056-791-179-270-081; 057-393-975-196-786; 058-810-636-458-981; 058-988-906-951-417; 059-356-429-761-258; 064-138-810-036-202; 064-492-707-800-120; 065-010-914-611-965; 066-932-733-337-191; 067-012-709-850-897; 068-352-266-416-553; 068-772-332-080-607; 069-819-766-532-975; 070-597-933-698-37X; 070-655-896-411-482; 071-152-974-312-669; 073-645-884-929-014; 076-110-707-101-775; 078-587-543-457-564; 079-604-164-254-167; 080-070-290-654-200; 080-504-729-503-86X; 082-093-169-349-743; 082-873-562-872-052; 086-289-108-660-714; 086-458-182-169-856; 087-982-922-387-638; 092-295-342-742-644; 092-655-468-792-272; 093-269-638-847-207; 097-500-322-356-449; 101-983-659-058-457; 102-286-835-467-181; 102-806-828-789-218; 109-271-396-864-507; 113-716-858-712-000; 116-673-114-514-767; 117-360-942-941-608; 117-642-795-346-23X; 126-257-237-474-283; 127-586-345-199-26X; 132-229-990-743-892; 134-887-710-239-93X; 135-001-594-144-079; 141-462-988-495-612; 145-313-633-857-991; 147-460-449-262-595; 155-407-272-307-336; 161-820-817-503-764; 164-931-769-098-880; 176-908-870-472-195,5,true,,hybrid
149-265-886-241-409,Japanandrsquo;s Society 5.0: Going Beyond Industry 4.0,,2019,journal article,Business and Economics Journal,21516219,,,Ozgur Onday,"The rapid evolution of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) is bringing drastic changes to society and industry. Digital transformation will create new values and is becoming a pillar of industrial policy in many countries. In anticipation of such global trends, “Society 5.0” was presented as a core concept in the 5th Science and Technology Basic Plan, adopted by the Japanese Cabinet in January 2016. It was identified as one growth strategy for Japan. Society 5.0 is also a core part of “The Investment for the Future Strategy 2017: Reform for Achieving Society 5.0” as part of its Fifth Science and Technology Basic Plan (FY16 to FY20), announced in April 2016, the Government of Japan aims to realize what it calls “Society 5.0,” or “Super Smart Society.” Society 5.0 provides a common societal infrastructure for prosperity based on an advanced service platform. The idea of progress has often been associated with modernity and social theory itself. In the bibliographical research carried out, as a curiosity the Wikipedia itself (in a consultation held on April 14, 2018) has referred to the concept of Industry 4.0, which raises interest worldwide in several, but it still does not have the concept of Society 5.0. In this paper, we can see that there is a lack of knowledge about the concept of Society 5.0. From a longitudinal perspective: “So, just what is Society 5.0? Taking a long view of history, I think we can define Society 1.0 as groups of people hunting and gathering in harmonious coexistence with nature, Society 2.0 as forming groups based on agricultural cultivation, increasing organization and Nation-building, Society 3.0 is a society that promotes industrialization through the Industrial Revolution, making mass production possible, and Society 4.0 as an information society that realizes increasing added value by connecting intangible assets as information networks. Society 5.0 is an information society built upon Society 4.0, aiming for a prosperous human-centered society.” Society 5.0 achieves a high degree of convergence between cyberspace (virtual space) and physical space (real space). In the past information society (Society 4.0), people would access a cloud service (databases) in cyberspace via the Internet and search for, retrieve, and analyze information or data. In Society 5.0, a huge amount of information from sensors in physical space is accumulated in cyberspace. In cyberspace, this big data is analyzed by artificial intelligence (AI), and the analysis results are fed back to humans in physical space in various forms. In the past information society, the common practice was to collect information via the network and have it analyzed by humans. In Society 5.0, however, people, things, and systems are all connected in cyberspace and optimal results obtained by AI exceeding the capabilities of humans are fed back to physical space. This process brings new value to industry and society in ways not previously possible. It is a presentation that is based on very recent publications, but which also has a prospective component, which always generates some in determination and uncertainty. Also, for this reason, it is a contribution that seeks above all else to contribute to this very urgent and necessary discussion.",10,2,1,6,Digital transformation; Political science; Prosperity; Industry 4.0; Information society; Cyberspace; Public relations; Industrialisation; Information and Communications Technology; Big data,,,,,https://www.hilarispublisher.com/abstract/japanrsquos-society-50-going-beyond-industry-40-33082.html https://www.hilarispublisher.com/open-access/japanrsquos-society-50-going-beyond-industry-40.pdf,https://www.hilarispublisher.com/abstract/japanrsquos-society-50-going-beyond-industry-40-33082.html,,,3119880852,,0,,7,false,,

Meetings of teachers and students from lecture halls are increasingly moving into the digital space of the Internet, adopting the formula of distance learning. The advent of Society 5.0 and Economy 5.0 will imply further changes. The necessity to integrate the real and virtual world, increased demand for information, limited time resources, and the need to combine professional work with education will cause higher education, in order to prepare future citizens to function in the area of sharing resources, to be forced to further adaptive transformations. The subject of this article is the analysis of the impact of technology on changes in higher education with an indication of the model of future paths of education in the Economy 5.0 trend. The source of the article was exploratory research of secondary sources, including books, articles, and reports, which were subjected to a critical analysis of the content. The obtained results made it possible to design and implement an explanatory study among students based on the CAWI methodology. The collected material became the basis for the authors to prepare a proposal for a model of future educational paths in accordance with the Economy 5.0 trend in which the flexibility of place and time, customization of the offer, cooperation, adaptability of teaching methods and instruments, and the proactive role of the teacher as a mentor and trainer constitute a set of set guidelines in the teaching model of the future. This model will be able to be used by universities and training institutions in the field of professionalization of the management of teaching and organizational processes.",11,11,5261,,The Internet; Higher education; Economy; Sociology; Trainer; Professionalization; Distance education; Function (engineering); Exploratory research; Teaching method,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/11/5261 https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/11/5261/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app11115261,,10.3390/app11115261,3168885220,,0,002-431-920-565-678; 010-972-533-756-45X; 013-287-665-466-861; 015-008-734-610-504; 018-678-398-593-814; 029-333-074-857-655; 031-756-607-363-516; 032-034-682-821-128; 034-476-070-261-685; 036-297-026-204-017; 040-778-348-220-273; 046-246-731-976-891; 056-049-545-647-082; 063-135-384-962-122; 068-490-188-515-163; 069-439-400-219-98X; 070-085-090-870-282; 073-325-440-578-871; 077-731-831-586-018; 087-736-676-519-645; 088-998-678-271-918; 099-032-118-510-718; 102-443-972-671-847; 115-847-590-573-793; 117-469-885-123-201; 120-749-568-596-544; 122-100-646-208-858; 122-236-205-400-839; 126-821-007-198-61X; 127-947-269-695-579; 137-059-616-282-11X; 148-362-079-352-645; 149-531-816-526-90X; 156-236-476-811-481; 189-539-081-416-095,4,true,cc-by,gold

Fernández-Caramés,"Industry 5.0 follows the steps of the Industry 4.0 paradigm and seeks for revolutionizing the way industries operate. In fact, Industry 5.0 focuses on research and innovation to support industrial production sustainability and place the well-being of industrial workers at the center of the production process. Thus, Industry 5.0 relies on three pillars: it is human-centric, it encourages sustainability and it is aimed at developing resilience against disruptions. Such core aspects cannot be fully achieved without a transparent end-to-end human-centered traceability throughout the value chain. As a consequence, Auto-Identification (Auto-ID) technologies play a key role, since they are able to provide automated item recognition, positioning and tracking without human intervention or in cooperation with industrial operators. Although the most popular Auto-ID technologies provide a certain degree of security and productivity, there are still open challenges for future Industry 5.0 factories. This article analyzes and evaluates the Auto-ID landscape and delivers a holistic perspective and understanding of the most popular and the latest technologies, looking for solutions that cope with harsh, diverse and complex industrial scenarios. In addition, it describes a methodology for selecting Auto-ID technologies for Industry 5.0 factories. Such a methodology is applied to a specific use case of the shipbuilding industry that requires identifying the main components of a ship during its construction and repair. To validate the outcomes of the methodology, a practical evaluation of passive and active UHF RFID tags was performed in an Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV) under construction, showing that a careful selection and evaluation of the tags enables product identification and tracking even in areas with a very high density of metallic objects. As a result, this article serves as a useful guide for industrial stakeholders, including future developers and managers that seek for deploying identification and traceability technologies in Industry 5.0 scenarios.",9,,140700,140730,Value chain; Engineering management; Traceability; Productivity; Resilience (network); Computer science; Shipbuilding; Sustainability; Identification (information); Industrial production,,,,"Auto-Identification for Intelligent Products Research Line of the Navantia-Universidade da Coruña Joint Research Unit; Centro de Investigación de Galicia ‘‘CITIC,’’ funded by Xunta de Galicia and the European Union",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9568924/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/access/access9.html#Fraga-LamasVF21,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/access.2021.3119775,,10.1109/access.2021.3119775,3207468962,,0,001-278-005-207-805; 001-546-860-043-918; 004-166-427-330-988; 005-009-895-542-778; 005-120-454-948-399; 006-401-754-649-451; 006-473-931-536-785; 006-597-493-672-65X; 008-901-499-326-236; 009-319-552-038-229; 009-811-414-488-648; 010-678-180-101-919; 010-972-533-756-45X; 012-980-074-133-335; 013-906-709-625-300; 014-005-608-022-509; 015-376-955-790-27X; 015-379-736-621-533; 015-904-952-310-302; 017-992-423-449-064; 019-127-221-119-979; 019-507-714-158-41X; 020-411-988-724-22X; 021-381-653-186-206; 022-940-214-318-814; 024-216-957-807-956; 024-759-937-247-438; 025-016-433-045-559; 025-812-684-521-30X; 028-468-987-605-219; 028-878-826-824-156; 029-500-643-247-60X; 030-153-628-264-104; 030-454-393-823-694; 030-596-147-948-081; 032-669-882-780-518; 033-922-553-502-499; 034-456-604-262-749; 034-756-651-364-224; 035-001-577-402-886; 035-980-512-441-018; 036-966-645-054-578; 038-520-662-449-164; 040-155-961-291-028; 041-354-227-907-615; 041-428-887-893-385; 041-619-870-618-354; 042-093-217-014-059; 046-088-451-219-238; 047-081-220-569-112; 047-332-984-826-186; 047-501-098-246-691; 049-992-401-043-662; 050-132-665-727-967; 050-255-293-285-52X; 051-725-650-520-728; 052-224-103-560-692; 052-390-775-001-328; 052-494-377-392-470; 053-397-444-734-488; 054-456-489-723-014; 055-750-444-809-889; 056-073-085-085-970; 056-870-976-321-182; 059-888-951-393-15X; 060-837-277-507-922; 063-267-317-875-891; 063-464-410-845-817; 064-027-231-154-130; 066-453-436-263-175; 067-101-261-890-173; 067-720-682-234-265; 068-285-232-144-871; 070-095-101-153-65X; 070-443-361-568-040; 070-988-548-518-983; 072-866-616-899-739; 074-208-995-036-260; 074-922-158-294-244; 075-119-075-675-854; 075-996-258-734-495; 082-377-263-801-104; 082-499-278-147-374; 087-809-166-122-677; 088-281-655-337-496; 089-546-495-818-57X; 094-470-848-660-142; 094-605-271-493-575; 095-415-504-907-329; 096-939-794-456-629; 097-251-112-529-343; 099-512-497-462-340; 099-984-216-091-666; 101-492-691-728-717; 102-368-937-447-332; 105-325-269-383-124; 108-613-585-717-080; 109-714-723-126-043; 110-336-541-237-666; 111-060-687-206-768; 111-243-882-085-06X; 112-065-907-512-820; 112-092-847-584-112; 113-580-898-517-445; 118-897-021-077-022; 121-609-557-812-186; 127-492-767-676-786; 135-317-873-756-837; 137-151-051-197-074; 140-831-046-514-167; 141-142-753-807-009; 141-197-464-395-341; 142-097-324-189-026; 142-499-916-630-147; 142-884-955-765-627; 143-622-521-619-91X; 143-947-051-557-480; 150-233-135-089-265; 152-712-839-538-824; 154-291-711-271-876; 156-182-043-768-747; 161-314-741-186-763; 162-854-426-677-97X; 164-180-530-939-997; 172-328-304-723-678; 173-061-938-041-130; 179-974-650-785-864; 181-538-214-596-312; 189-894-145-764-360,9,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

Starting from the preliminary study already realized on the different user-robot collaboration categorizations present in the literature (Formati et al, 2021), the new contribution, through the review of the still insufficient regulatory framework, ergonomic factors and robotic systems existing in the manufacturing field, returns the definition of further specifications about the collaboration modalities. In the current technological ecosystem, through the discipline of design is possible to prefigure and reinforce the collaborative processes through the introduction of new protocols and tools to support the regulatory standards, synthesis and evolution of the investigated categorizations, in order to optimize the production system as a whole and improve the working conditions of the operator with the robotic systems in terms of predictability, reliability, and usability.</jats:p>",,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.54941/ahfe1001653,,10.54941/ahfe1001653,,,0,,0,false,,

C. Ng; Takayuki Hirose; Hideki Nomoto,"<jats:p>Globalization and mass customization are commonly translated into increased levels of complexity in manufacturing systems. One of the main reasons is the increased number of variables, parameters, and interrelations on the shop floor. This intrinsic complexity can grow exponentially when considering the manufacture of large-size products with high levels of variability and variants: the mass production of large recreational motorboats with high levels of customization and low production volumes, mass customization. With the increasing role of sustainability and concepts of Industry 5.0, focusing not just on improving production systems but also human wellbeing, quick decision making becomes essential. Data and digitalization are becoming the cornerstone for system improvement, and digital data availability and analysis can facilitate the utilization of computerized tools to support decision making and maximize the performance of complex systems. For that purpose, simulation can be a powerful analytical tool to design, maintain, and improve complex manufacturing systems. Simulation techniques usually allow handling the size and complexity commonly associated with manufacturing systems. However, in systems with highly customized and large-size products, manual processes, and limited floor space, the implementation of simulation techniques is not straightforward, especially considering the aspects of variability, data collection, model validation, and system reconfiguration. With a particular focus on large-size products and limitations of a constrained existing facility layout, this paper presents the implementation of a simulation-based reconfiguration assessment considering manual production, assembly, and internal logistics requirements. Going through an industrial case study of large recreational motorboats manufacturing, the paper analyses the system analysis, data collection, implementation, and validation of the methodology step by step. Considering different what-if scenarios, the focus is on the capacity reconfiguration using Discrete-Event Simulation. The results can serve as a guideline for decision-makers and stakeholders working with complex mass customization manufacturing systems and space-constrained facility layouts.</jats:p>",,,,,Mass customization; Control reconfiguration; Computer science; Production (economics); Industrial engineering; Product (mathematics); Personalization; Raw data; Systems engineering; Manufacturing engineering,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/atde220130,,10.3233/atde220130,,,0,,0,true,,gold

To maintain production and adjust quickly to technological transformation, innovative work-based learning approaches are emphasized. Intelligent machines are becoming capable of interaction and collaboration with humans. They not only introduce a new type of learnable workforce to manufacturing but may open opportunities to enhance learning of all learners. Symbiotic relationships of humans and machines have wide potential for human-centric manufacturing (aka Industry 5.0). Moreover, connecting smart devices and deploying self-learning solutions is envisioned to increase flexibility of manufacturing, thus changing work division between humans and machines. Where humans and machines collaborate, the term Reciprocal Learning has been coined to describe the process of bidirectional learning. While a definition of Reciprocal Learning exists the boundary conditions of the concept are still ambiguous. In this paper, a framework for Reciprocal Learning in Human-Machine Collaboration for Industry 5.0 is presented to clarify what it is and what it isn’t. The approach is based on a multi-agent system perspective, comprising human and machine agents. Finally, an outlook on future research is presented.</jats:p>",,,207,225,Flexibility (engineering); Reciprocal; Workforce; Computer science; Industry 4.0; Artificial intelligence; Manufacturing; Knowledge management; Process (computing); Engineering; Human–computer interaction,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.30844/wagb_2022_11,,10.30844/wagb_2022_11,,,0,,0,false,,

Balashova,"<jats:p>The research objective of the present article is to study new world trends in industrial deve¬lopment and the reaction speed of national governments, companies and workers to technological changes. As research methods, analysis and synthesis of current world trends were applied, as well as special methods were used: expert assessments of international organizations were analyzed, a comparative and economic-statistical analysis was carried out. As a result, the distinctive features of Industry 5.0 are highlighted – this is the coexistence of industry and new social and environmental trends and needs. Change is inevitable: green energy and sustainable products will initially be a monopoly factor and benefit insiders. It is emphasized that in order to achieve global competitiveness, companies need to transform established business models and invest in technology and network forms of business, taking into account social goals: in addition to creating new jobs and ensuring flexible employment, we are talking about personalization of goods and greening. The poli¬tical and economic goals of the fifth industrial revolution and the direction of technological innovations are considered. It is emphasized that technology, according to the new approach, should serve people and society, which means that the technology used in production adapts to the needs and diversity of industry workers. The leaders are artificial intelligence, quantum information and semiconductors. Technological transformation is based on the development of the following areas: individual technologies for human-machine interaction, biotechnology and smart materials, artificial intelligence, digital twins, data transmission, storage and analysis technologies, as well as energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, storage and autonomy. It is an ecosystem-based innovation policy with a flexible focus on results. It is noted that technological transformation will help solve a number of unique social problems. It puts a bold focus from individual technologies to a system approach that allows the industry to achieve social goals beyond job creation and growth, and puts the well-being of industry workers at the center of the production process. In conclusion, the techno-social nature of the fifth revolution is revealed, with technology as tools and social needs as the ultimate goal.</jats:p>",22,2,141,147,Industrial organization; Technological revolution; Diversity (politics); Digital transformation; Business; Technological change; Order (exchange); Sustainable development; Competitive advantage; Big data; Economics; Marketing,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.14529/ctcr220213,,10.14529/ctcr220213,,,0,,0,true,,gold

Secondly, online surveys and in-depth interviews were administered to understand the current status of IM development and future development goals. Finally, case studies were conducted to demonstrate whether the hypothesis of the development approach is feasible.,This study finds that the overall maturity level of the local valve industry is still in the planning stage since the local valve industry lacks concentration and is relatively scattered. In addition, the feasible development approach is dependent on smart devices to improve production efficiency, ensure quality management and effectively control costs.,The research is conducted and focused on the Yangtze River Delta region instead of the whole country, and the size of the sample is small. Therefore, there may be some characteristics omitted in the analysis.,Manufacturers can upgrade to smart manufacturing through intelligent software platforms in order to complete an automatic interaction of data and devices. In addition, manufacturers should complete cross-regional collaborative development through the industrial Internet of things.,There is little or none of research work completed for the development strategy of the valve industry internationally.

Literasi Indonesia,,null Muhammad Ihsaan Rizqulloh,"<jats:p>Business digitization is the change of communication, interaction, and business functions to digital. In business applications, digitization changes the business processes, functions, and business models applied to digital technology. One of the most successful ways to deal with the digital revolution is business digitization in the 5.0 society era. The concept of society 5.0 is related to the National Economic Recovery, which aims to build a human-centered society where economic development and problem-solving can be achieved. The role of business digitization during the Covid-19 pandemic is very influential on the Indonesian economy, especially for government programs that have used digital systems and supported Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). This study uses a qualitative descriptive approach, using secondary data obtained from the Central Statistics Agency, journals, books, and other sources relevant to the research. Based on the research results, there is a very significant change in business digitization in the era of society 5.0, where digital business is more promising than conventional concepts.</jats:p>",1,2,120,126,Digitization; Agency (philosophy); Unemployment; Government (linguistics); Business model; Business; Business process,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.47540/ijqr.v1i2.366,,10.47540/ijqr.v1i2.366,,,0,,1,true,cc-by-sa,hybrid
168-478-531-030-862,Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0 from the Lean perspective,2022-06-20,2022,journal article,"International Journal of Management, Knowledge and Learning",22325697; 22325107,International School for Social and Business Studies,,Raphael Souza; Helio Ferenhof; Fernando Forcellini,"<jats:p>Purpose: Despite the significant attention that Industry 4.0 (I4.0) has gained in the last decade, little importance has been given to shop-floor workers' role in effectively implementing these new technologies in production systems. Nowadays, several authors discuss the need to bring workers back to the center of the decision-making about implementing the new technologies in what is being called Industry 5.0 (I5.0). A key factor of using these new concepts is that it must make sense, and the new information generated by these technologies must have a precise use; otherwise, it will be considered waste. The Lean approach is already recognized as the best approach to identify and eliminate waste from production systems. Not only that, but it allows decisions about process improvement to be human-centric. Thus, this article aims to present the main aspects and evolution of I4.0 and I5.0 over time, using the Lean approach as the analysis lenses.&#x0D;; Study design/methodology/approach: In order to identify the mains aspects of I4.0 and I5.0, we develop a consistent literature review using the Systematic Search Flow (SSF).&#x0D;; Findings: As a result, it was possible to identify the evolution from I4.0 to I5.0, In I4.0, the main focus was on developing new technologies, combine them with classic Lean tools (e.g. Kanban 4.0, Poka-Yoke 4.0) and implement Cyber-Physical Systems. In I5.0, the focus is to use these new technologies together with shop floor workers to continuously improve production processes. Not only that, but in I5.0, the protagonist becomes (or return to become) the shop floor workers to lead the improvements, as is in the Toyota Kata approach.&#x0D;; Originality/value: This work presents a new way of interpreting the progression of concepts from I4.0 to I5.0. In addition, the focus on workers for problem solving is returning to the center of the discussion. Together with the technologies of I4.0, this represents a new area for future research.</jats:p>",11,,,,Industry 4.0; Kanban; Lean manufacturing; Cyber-physical system; Emerging technologies; Computer science; Process (computing); Production (economics); Perspective (graphical); Process management; Focus (optics); Knowledge management; Engineering; Manufacturing engineering,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.53615/2232-5697.11.145-155,,10.53615/2232-5697.11.145-155,,,0,,1,true,cc-by-sa,gold

This paper provides a novel study focused on the human aspects involved in industrial HRC by exploring the effects of various HRC setting factors. In particular, this paper aims at investigating the impact of industrial HRC on user experience, affective state, and stress, assessed through both subjective measures (i.e., questionnaires) and objective ones (i.e., physiological signals). A collaborative assembly task was implemented with different configurations, in which the robot movement speed, the distance between the operator and the robot workspace, and the control of the task execution time were varied. Forty-two participants were involved in the study and provided feedbacks on interaction quality and their affective state. Participants’ physiological responses (i.e., electrodermal activity and heart rate) were also collected non-invasively to monitor the amount of stress generated by the interaction. Analysis of both subjective and objective responses revealed how the configuration factors considered influence them. Robot movement speed and control of the task execution time resulted to be the most influential factors. The results also showed the need for customization of HRC to improve ergonomics, both psychological and physical, and the well-being of the operator.</jats:p>",106,2,,,,,,,"Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10846-022-01744-8,,10.1007/s10846-022-01744-8,,,0,001-371-430-906-291; 003-895-722-847-457; 004-877-171-081-463; 007-277-985-466-338; 009-766-493-751-167; 009-962-238-587-011; 011-797-116-120-363; 012-603-390-719-879; 016-693-057-650-297; 018-470-980-839-733; 019-322-807-781-410; 031-311-188-755-66X; 043-376-461-731-259; 046-502-883-588-409; 048-196-188-279-348; 048-215-752-069-802; 049-429-316-643-847; 049-783-671-957-498; 052-480-466-586-464; 054-817-235-104-118; 056-487-069-992-810; 060-681-723-321-098; 060-880-139-042-526; 064-600-226-148-683; 066-760-188-202-831; 067-748-140-319-824; 071-788-380-906-199; 073-807-077-611-754; 081-790-694-130-042; 084-688-266-180-711; 094-300-412-136-41X; 094-962-488-513-157; 096-239-462-922-956; 098-150-923-941-220; 101-555-046-927-567; 104-414-457-934-454; 106-470-097-774-176; 108-826-021-393-366; 115-698-393-672-251; 116-783-289-698-518; 119-327-602-496-18X; 129-316-555-610-005; 179-717-452-517-466,0,false,,

However, changes caused by introduction of modern technologies, and increasing complexity of products and production, directly affect the industrial enterprises and workers. The critics of the Industry 4.0 paradigm emphasized its orientation to new technologies and digitalization in a technocratic way. Therefore, the new industrial paradigm Industry 5.0 appeared very soon and automatically triggered a debate about the role of, and reasons for applying, the new paradigm. Industry 5.0 is complementing the existing Industry 4.0 paradigm with the orientation to the worker who has an important role in the production process, and that role has been emphasized during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this research, there is a brief discussion on main drivers and enablers for introduction of these new paradigms, then a literature-based analysis is carried out to highlight the differences between two paradigms from three important aspects—people, organization, and technology. The conclusion emphasizes the main features and concerns regarding the movement towards Industry 5.0, and the general conclusion is that there is a significant change of the main research aims from sustainability towards human-centricity.

It includes, in particular, the expert subsystem and the decision support subsystem. Formalization of knowledge for making a decision about the presence of counterfeit is carried out on the basis of production rules. They are generated based on information contained in morphological tables. The development of a prototype ES is carried out in the programming language of artificial intelligence Prolog. The results of optimizing the approximation of a polychrome image of slices of meat products are described. A method for solving it based on a genetic algorithm is proposed. A program was developed in the C++ programming language, using which a complex of computational experiments was carried out to study the nature of the dependence of the convergence of the optimization process. Various parameters varied: the maximum number of iterations, the choice of the initial population. Further studies in this direction are related to the implementation of all the necessary image processing algorithms to automatically identify the required values of the characteristics of the image fragments for use in the cyber-physical system of automation of the process of identifying falsified meat products.",,,179,201,Digital image processing; Decision support system; Automation; Data mining; Population; Computer science; Process (engineering); Prolog; Genetic algorithm; Systems architecture,,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-63563-3_15.pdf https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-63563-3_15,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63563-3_15,,10.1007/978-3-030-63563-3_15,3119836668,,0,002-298-426-825-77X; 007-780-889-123-501; 010-183-087-949-830; 017-105-149-892-499; 029-760-401-274-294; 034-251-039-625-21X; 034-930-876-379-241; 036-156-766-183-54X; 038-221-206-294-998; 040-533-496-683-311; 040-834-797-207-422; 041-645-013-800-02X; 048-349-603-482-955; 049-411-757-708-559; 074-416-834-176-349; 075-377-851-117-989; 076-353-823-127-32X; 076-428-986-310-35X; 094-136-481-011-491; 096-573-945-486-806; 100-398-070-015-581; 112-126-520-565-334; 115-813-940-046-040; 117-833-401-881-320; 134-880-795-062-739; 139-905-102-687-569,4,false,,

The model of binary logistic regression was taken as a basis. Based on the available sample of precedents, a statistically reliable decision rule has been developed, on the basis of which a method for recognizing the severity of the condition of new patients can be developed. As an assessment of the severity of the newborn, the probability of its assignment to the corresponding group of patients was used. The results on the test sample of data showed high statistical reliability of the classification of patients. This allows us to use the proposed method to assess the health status of premature newborns and timely provide the necessary complex medical manipulations.KeywordsPreterm infantsForecastModelLogistic regressionDiscriminant analysisClassification",,,15,27,Logistic regression; Medicine; Multivariate statistics; Gestational age; Reliability (semiconductor); Premature newborn; Test (biology); Gestation; Pediatrics,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-95112-2_2,,10.1007/978-3-030-95112-2_2,,,0,002-771-936-331-885; 013-249-011-392-499; 021-178-981-701-541; 022-415-945-189-379; 024-839-177-816-924; 029-369-311-888-370; 033-432-966-143-277; 035-198-346-653-356; 037-488-436-990-40X; 041-570-663-037-253; 049-325-653-337-780; 049-752-053-039-436; 055-476-103-543-518; 060-016-611-765-137; 071-728-474-672-43X; 074-255-882-108-08X; 084-359-913-935-168; 102-290-948-009-226; 122-236-477-792-434; 139-890-047-039-673; 151-120-651-920-866,0,false,,

DTs can bring benefits e.g., increase visibility, safety, and accessibility of the system. Further, digital experimentation can reduce time and cost. Though, application of DT technologies involves challenges i.e., model accuracy or errors in transferring data or codes between the DT and the physical twin. Many studies on DTs focus on industrial applications. However, DT technology has potential for implementation of digital labs in education. This aspect of DTs is of rising importance as distance education has increased over the last decade and access to physical laboratories can be restricted due to factors such as the Covid-19 pandemic. Thus, there is a need to study the use of DT technology in higher education. To address this, we investigate possibilities and challenges of applying DT technology in education to conduct industrial-like labs virtually. A case of an automation line, with full scale industrial equipment, based at a research center, is focused. Results emphasize that the application of DT technologies require multi-domain expertise to understand the consequences of every single decision in the design process on every piece of equipment involved, making the modelling process complex and time consuming. Thus, when applied in education, test procedures need to be designed to focus on students’ motivation, improved learning and understanding of production systems. DTs are considered enabling technologies supporting the concept of Industry 5.0, thus stressing the human-centric aspects of advancing Industry 4.0. The predicted application of DTs emphasizes the need for educational curricula that include laboratory applications and theoretic understanding of DT technologies. This study focusses the application of DT technologies in higher education curricula, but the result of the study can contribute to other areas such as automation and virtual commissioning towards smarter manufacturing.</jats:p>",,,,,Automation; Process (computing); Domain (mathematical analysis); Industry 4.0; Engineering; Computer science; Engineering management,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/atde220165,,10.3233/atde220165,,,0,,0,true,,gold

Although the notion of DX has garnered much research interest from practitioners, scholarship on this topic is somehow lagging behind, possibly because of the lack of theoretical frameworks on DX. Recently, most Japanese firms have begun to use diverse digital technologies to sustain their competitive advantages. However, the return of investment on digital technologies has not been as high as expected for some firms. Furthermore, as the visions of Industry 5.0 describe sustainable, resilient, and human-centered future factories that will require smart and resilient capabilities both from next-generation manufacturing systems and human operators, it is necessary to design resilient human–machine collaborations within factories. To this end, this paper presents a research model between DX technologies and scientific problem-solving in terms of deduction, induction, and abduction inference structures as an approach to resilient human–machine collaborations. The purpose of this research is to analyze the difference in the utilization pattern of the digital technology of American, German, and Japanese firms based on three types of decision-making methods. Next, we apply this framework in a comparative case study of two Japanese firms and one German firm, where we find that there is a difference in DX technologies utilization among the Japanese and German firms. We assert that the utilization of IoT technology in the United States and Germany is pursuing IoT with the aim of autonomous control, whereas Japanese firms prioritize robot–human collaboration. Finally, we discuss how our findings contribute to the burgeoning field of resilient human–machine collaborations by showing the distinct roles of deduction, induction, and abduction inference structures. Furthermore, our research contributes to international comparative studies to identify the difference in national IT utilization. Lessons and implications are discussed.</jats:p>",14,17,10583,10583,Lagging; Digital transformation; German; Pace; Industrial organization; Vision; Industry 4.0; Business; Computer science; Marketing,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su141710583,,10.3390/su141710583,,,0,002-085-045-445-344; 003-399-150-768-506; 006-947-132-272-228; 007-157-342-877-831; 009-851-433-625-819; 012-218-887-216-344; 022-613-542-030-336; 023-790-190-496-186; 025-838-880-494-316; 031-235-778-832-782; 036-555-670-584-005; 041-406-317-756-787; 053-089-404-364-449; 056-485-524-375-867; 061-012-983-689-452; 063-390-375-334-464; 067-050-661-116-219; 068-833-488-459-388; 081-596-379-437-686; 087-501-199-643-670; 088-321-242-569-049; 102-113-825-126-978; 102-226-089-425-46X; 115-232-897-230-33X; 143-724-850-069-880; 146-473-356-444-943; 148-879-759-455-156; 157-213-706-957-756; 171-092-306-725-218,0,true,cc-by,gold

Currently, there is a need to consider sustainable development and the crucial role of man in the assumptions of industry’s future development. Concerns about the implementation of the fourth industrial revolution’s technology became the basis for building the assumptions of Industry 5.0. The article aims to identify the social and economic expectations of the development of the fourth industrial revolution in the context of the development of the sustainability, humanization, and resilience of Industry 4.0. The article presents the results of research obtained based on a critical analysis of the literature and surveys conducted among representatives of Polish society. As a result of the research, key social expectations as to the directions of development of the Industry 4.0 concept were identified. Recommendations for industry development focused on three areas of development—human-centric, sustainable, and resilient—were established. The presented research results will allow the development of an investment strategy and a government policy to support the development of industry based on the human-centric digitization of the economy.</jats:p>",14,3,1391,1391,Industrial Revolution; Government (linguistics); Sustainable development; Industry 4.0; Context (archaeology); Digitization; Sustainability; Process (computing); Prosperity; Dehumanization; Identification (biology); Business; Economics; Economic growth; Economic system,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14031391,,10.3390/su14031391,,,0,002-995-208-654-267; 007-592-719-575-515; 011-575-011-664-790; 013-287-665-466-861; 013-833-776-008-172; 015-008-734-610-504; 015-499-462-446-614; 016-819-194-616-838; 017-415-713-662-955; 017-640-020-815-147; 020-924-235-588-204; 024-047-654-726-820; 025-131-859-546-629; 025-253-322-092-116; 028-232-581-949-707; 028-321-099-284-473; 029-434-241-679-095; 033-541-372-628-755; 036-175-603-962-622; 036-652-321-315-178; 038-964-429-089-518; 039-246-626-911-312; 040-252-352-426-753; 048-038-873-341-337; 048-872-880-871-621; 049-816-999-056-296; 051-719-689-499-873; 052-471-621-847-448; 052-603-569-095-390; 057-670-948-885-722; 059-768-273-435-982; 060-352-821-341-634; 063-312-615-700-918; 063-835-629-463-485; 067-036-276-850-854; 071-473-279-124-057; 071-666-089-865-306; 072-236-779-686-90X; 072-974-520-873-188; 075-662-363-625-645; 076-248-573-094-89X; 076-303-271-715-610; 078-407-023-029-477; 078-963-554-027-275; 079-725-390-592-069; 080-323-040-873-403; 081-483-272-003-684; 096-577-069-851-321; 097-238-534-260-747; 102-424-326-687-39X; 102-861-736-374-631; 113-830-545-572-413; 122-389-536-558-056; 125-795-343-058-314; 126-014-294-266-089; 127-021-195-266-886; 132-434-066-780-80X; 138-332-915-687-580; 146-118-783-422-427; 152-593-264-986-247; 169-380-214-360-631,6,true,cc-by,gold

The transformation of real things in the physical world to the Internet of things given a rise to industrial IoT (IIoT). IIoT applications are intended for the automation of the manufacturing industry, called Industry 4.0. Also, due to needs of end-user personalization, Industry 5.0 is becoming popular nowadays. Industry 5.0 is intended to inject artificial intelligence (AI) into human lives to improve capabilities and productivity. To make Industry 5.0 a successful revolution, IIoT must provide better efficiency, improved productivity, and better asset management. In this context, device-to-device communication plays an important role. IoT devices must be enabled with seamless communication technologies over heterogeneous networks. In this paper, communication standards, technologies, and various published research contributions are reviewed. Further, an analysis is presented to formulate challenges and opportunities for designing communication methods for IIoT. The paper also provides general directions for developing communication techniques in perspective to Industry 5.0.KeywordsIndustrial Internet of thingsCyber physical systemsDevice-to-device communicationIndustry 4.0Industry 5.0Fog computing",,,107,122,Industry 4.0; Industrial Internet; Automation; The Internet; Computer science; Context (archaeology); Telecommunications; Engineering; Engineering management,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-1142-2_9,,10.1007/978-981-19-1142-2_9,,,0,003-949-545-621-510; 004-147-201-435-492; 004-657-969-295-116; 004-756-080-064-982; 005-458-970-721-965; 008-606-818-185-257; 010-011-204-398-775; 013-414-900-006-945; 014-704-714-040-690; 016-904-719-895-937; 017-415-713-662-955; 019-274-193-538-542; 024-866-095-172-751; 025-016-433-045-559; 027-191-169-453-078; 028-617-690-685-816; 031-788-368-038-551; 040-495-254-394-379; 047-366-241-745-188; 049-723-147-057-587; 049-816-999-056-296; 055-455-911-583-179; 056-143-855-473-699; 062-541-391-558-264; 063-672-358-747-289; 070-444-790-353-034; 076-991-386-599-906; 078-506-671-857-207; 082-979-338-329-229; 085-519-041-700-527; 086-035-228-781-182; 090-662-688-328-327; 104-407-152-275-456; 108-992-675-569-539; 113-830-545-572-413; 115-709-456-822-925; 116-959-791-926-13X; 121-609-557-812-186; 122-479-711-922-142; 123-885-241-189-563; 133-130-311-546-210; 145-358-884-154-288; 145-986-287-163-781; 149-767-685-268-592; 151-858-066-475-870; 151-933-542-063-146; 158-267-202-918-710; 159-152-911-726-224; 170-676-898-744-06X,0,false,,
