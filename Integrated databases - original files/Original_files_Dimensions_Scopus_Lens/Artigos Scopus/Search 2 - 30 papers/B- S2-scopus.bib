abstract={Zero defect manufacturing (ZDM) aims at eliminating defects throughout the value stream as well as the cost of rework and scrap. The ambitious goal of zero defects requires the extensive utilization of emerging technologies. Amidst the major drive for technological advancement, humans are often kept out of the loop because they are perceived as the root cause of error. The report from the European Commission on Industry 5.0 emphasizes that human-centric is a key pillar in building a more resilient industry and is vital to incorporate the human component into the manufacturing sector. However, we did not find any publications that explain what human-centric ZDM is, nor what the roles of humans are in advancing ZDM. As a contribution to bridging this gap, a systematic literature review is conducted using different databases. We collected 36 publications and categorised them into 3 different human roles which are managers, engineers, and operators. From our search, we found out that managers play a vital role in cultivating ZDM in the entire organization to prevent errors despite the fact they often do not have direct contact with the production line as operators. Operators can help advance ZDM through knowledge capturing with feedback functions to the engineer to better design a corrective action to prevent errors. Assistive technologies such as extended reality are efficient tools used by operators to eliminate human errors in production environments. Human-centric is now a goal in the future manufacturing sector, but it could face barriers such as high technological investments and resistance to changes in their work tasks. This paper can contribute to paving the roadmap of human-centric ZDM to bring defects to zero and reposition the manufacturing sector to become more resilient. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={The intelligent warehouse logistics system (IWLS) is an essential component in the emerging industry 5.0. To well assist the IWLS, advanced network architecture and control policies with the adaptive capability to the variation of traffic should be specially designed. In this paper, we consider an air-and-ground cooperative wireless network that enables dynamic coverage to support the flexible scheduling of the automatic guided vehicles (AGVs) in the IWLS. Jointly considering the dynamic deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as well as the adaptive power control of AGVs, we formulate a two time-scale network control problem to minimize the transmission power consumption of all AGVs under their individual rate requirement. On large time scales, we first propose a particle swarm optimization based algorithm (PSOA) to obtain the deployment position of the ABS. Then, using the results of the PSOA as training data, we design a deep neural network (DNN) framework aimed at reducing the computational time of the PSOA. On small time scales, we devise an online power control algorithm (OPCA) by using some of stochastic network optimization methods. With current channel conditions, the OPCA can generate the real-time power control policy and ensure the long-term rate requirement. Numerical simulations indicate that the DNN framework enhances the coverage performance of the network only consuming a few milliseconds of computation time. Incorporated with the OPCA, the total transmission power of the AGVs is significantly reduced. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The European Commission defined the new concept of Industry 5.0 meaning a more human-centric, resilient, and sustainable approach for the design of industrial systems and operations. A deep understanding of the work environment and organization is important to start analysing the working conditions and the resulting User eXperience (UX) of the operators. Also, the knowledge about users’ needs and ergonomics is fundamental to optimize the workers’ wellbeing, working conditions, and industrial results. In this context, the paper presents a strategy to effectively assess the UX of workers to promote human-centric vision of manufacturing sites, enhancing the overall sustainability of the modern factories. A set of non-invasive wearable devices is used to monitor human activities and collect physiological parameters, as well as questionnaires to gather subjective self-assessment. This set-up was applied to virtual reality (VR) simulation, replicating heavy duty work sequence tasks that took place in an oil and gas pipes manufacturing site. This approach allowed the identification of possible stressful conditions for the operator, from physical and mental perspectives, which may compromise the performance.

abstract={Recent advances in materials modelling, characterization and materials informatics suggest that deep integration of such methods can be a crucial aspect of the Industry 5.0 revolution, where the fourth industrial revolution paradigms are combined with the concepts of transition to a sustainable, human-centric and resilient industry. We pose a specific deep integration challenge beyond the ordinary multidisciplinary modelling/characterization research approach in this short communication with research and innovation as drivers for scientific excellence. Full integration can be achieved by developing common ontologies across different domains, enabling meaningful computational and experimental data integration and interoperability. On this basis, fine-tuning of adaptive materials modelling/characterization protocols can be achieved and facilitate computational and experimental efforts. Such interoperable and meaningful data combined with advanced data science tools (including machine learning and artificial intelligence) become a powerful asset for materials scientists to extract complex information from the large amount of data generated by last generation characterization techniques. To achieve this ambitious goal, significant collaborative actions are needed to develop common, usable, and sharable digital tools that allow for effective and efficient twinning of data and workflows across the different materials modelling and characterization domains. © 2022},

abstract={Industry 5.0 blows the whistle on global industrial transformation. It aims to place humans’ well-being at the center of manufacturing systems, thereby achieving social goals beyond employment and growth to provide prosperity robustly for the sustainable development of all humanity. However, the current exploration of Industry 5.0 is still in its infancy where research findings are relatively scarce and little systematic. This paper first reviews the evolutionary vein of Industry 5.0 and three leading characteristics of Industry 5.0: human-centricity, sustainability, and resiliency. The connotation system of Industry 5.0 is discussed, and its diversified essence is analyzed. Then, this paper constructs a tri-dimension system architecture for implementing Industry 5.0, namely, the technical dimension, reality dimension, and application dimension. The paper further discusses key enablers, the future implementation path, potential applications, and challenges of realistic scenarios of Industry 5.0. Finally, the limitations of the current research are discussed with potential future research directions highlighted. It is expected that this review work will arouse lively discussions and debates, and bring together the strengths of all beings for building a comprehensive system of Industry 5.0. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers},

abstract={In the era of Industry 4.0, manufacturing and production systems were revolutionized by increasing operational efficiency and developing and implementing new business models, services, and products. Concretely, the milestone set for Industry 4.0 was to improve the sustainability and efficiency of production systems. By extension, the emphasis was focused on both the digitization and the digitalization of systems, providing room for further improvement. However, the current technological evolution is more system/machine-oriented, rather than human-oriented. Thus, several countries have begun orchestrating initiatives towards the design and development of the human-centric aspect of technologies, systems, and services, which has been coined as Industry 5.0. The impact of Industry 5.0 will extend to societal transformation, which eventually leads to the generation of a new society, the Society 5.0. The developments will be focused on the social and human-centric aspect of the tools and technologies introduced under the framework of Industry 4.0. Therefore, sustainability and human well-being will be at the heart of what comes next, the Industry 5.0, as a subset of Society 5.0. Industry 5.0 will build on the foundations laid during Industry 4.0 by emphasizing human-centered, resilient, and sustainable design. Consequently, the authors in this research work, through a critical literature review, aim to provide adequate reasoning for considering Industry 5.0 as a framework for enabling the coexistence of industry and emerging societal trends and needs.

abstract={The Digital Transformation (DX) megatrend is fundamentally disrupting and changing the nature of work, business, and industry at a rapid pace. Although the notion of DX has garnered much research interest from practitioners, scholarship on this topic is somehow lagging behind, possibly because of the lack of theoretical frameworks on DX. Recently, most Japanese firms have begun to use diverse digital technologies to sustain their competitive advantages. However, the return of investment on digital technologies has not been as high as expected for some firms. Furthermore, as the visions of Industry 5.0 describe sustainable, resilient, and human-centered future factories that will require smart and resilient capabilities both from next-generation manufacturing systems and human operators, it is necessary to design resilient human–machine collaborations within factories. To this end, this paper presents a research model between DX technologies and scientific problem-solving in terms of deduction, induction, and abduction inference structures as an approach to resilient human–machine collaborations. The purpose of this research is to analyze the difference in the utilization pattern of the digital technology of American, German, and Japanese firms based on three types of decision-making methods. Next, we apply this framework in a comparative case study of two Japanese firms and one German firm, where we find that there is a difference in DX technologies utilization among the Japanese and German firms. We assert that the utilization of IoT technology in the United States and Germany is pursuing IoT with the aim of autonomous control, whereas Japanese firms prioritize robot–human collaboration. Finally, we discuss how our findings contribute to the burgeoning field of resilient human–machine collaborations by showing the distinct roles of deduction, induction, and abduction inference structures. Furthermore, our research contributes to international comparative studies to identify the difference in national IT utilization. Lessons and implications are discussed. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Scholars believe that the newly introduced Industry 5.0 has the potential to move beyond the profit-centered productivity of Industry 4.0 and to promote sustainable development goals such as human-centricity, socio-environmental sustainability, and resilience. However, little has been done to understand how this ill-defined phenomenon may deliver its indented sustainability values despite these speculative promises. To address this knowledge gap, the present study developed a strategy roadmap that explains the mechanism by which Industry 5.0 delivers its intended sustainable development functions. The study first developed and introduced the Industry 5.0 reference model that describes the technical and functional properties of this phenomenon. The study further conducted a content-centric synthesis of the literature and identified the sustainable development functions of Industry 5.0. Next, the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique was employed to identify the sequential relationships among the functions and construct the Industry 5.0-enabled model of sustainable development. The ISM involved collecting the opinions of 11 Industry 5.0 experts through expert panel meetings. Results revealed that Industry 5.0 delivers sustainable development values through 16 functions. Circular intelligent products, employee technical assistance, intelligent automation, open sustainable innovation, renewable integration, and supply chain adaptability are examples of the functions identified. These functions are highly interrelated and should be developed in a specific order so that the synergies and complementarities among them would maximize the sustainable development value gains. The roadmap to Industry 5.0-driven sustainability developed in this study is expected to provide a better understanding of ways Industry 5.0 can contribute to sustainable development, explaining how the development of its functions should be managed to maximize their synergies and contribution to the intended sustainability values. The study also highlights important avenues for future research, emphasizing the potential enablers of Industry 5.0 development, such as Government 5.0 or Corporate Governance 5.0. © 2022},

abstract={The contemporary world becomes more and more volatile and unpredictable every year (dynamic development of technology—Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0, dynamic global changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic, great changes in consumer behavior, climate crisis, geopolitical disruptions). Individuals, companies, and supply chains face challenges emerging from economic, sociological, and political phenomena. These phenomena disrupt regular performance and limit the efficient functioning of companies and economies. Due to numerous relations and connections in the economy, disruptions in one area affect the others and spread, growing in range and severity. Hence, disruptions should be dealt with to provide continuity of supply chains and to ensure their efficient and effective performance. The study aims to identify crucial characteristics of disruptions to facilitate disruption minimization strategies. The characteristics of disruptions in supply chains are identified based on a literature review, synthesized and validated by the experts. A study is implemented to validate identified characteristics and to confront theoretical findings with the practical experience and observations of the experts. The results of the study are discussed and commented on. The conclusions from the study refer to the nature and characteristics of disruptions in the contemporary economy, equipping managers with useful knowledge when dealing with disruptions, and academics with observations that can stimulate further discussion on stability, flexibility, and resilience of companies and supply chains. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a cost-effective method to support the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and is an enabling technology for Industry 5.0. The use of RFID is particularly suited to IIoT as it does not require a line of sight for communication and can be retroactively affixed to non-smart items. However, RFID communication is affected by the properties of the material the tag is affixed to, specifically the material permittivity. Metal is commonly present in smart factory environments and supply chains and impedes RFID communication. A suitable tag design is required to accommodate these challenges and ensure resilience for Industry 5.0 applications. The research presented in this paper has assessed the communication performance of RFID antenna designs with and without metal present beneath the tag. The RFID tag designs that performed reliably in the simulation were manufactured, and their read range was tested on materials of varying relative permittivity and thickness to represent MP and NMP scenarios. The results have verified the robustness of “Cyber” to “Physical” designs and provide recommendations to support practitioner IIoT tag selection. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={In light of the Industry 5.0 trend towards human-centric and resilient industries, human-robot collaboration (HRC) assembly lines can be used to enhance productivity and workers’ well-being, provided that the optimal allocation of tasks and available resources can be determined. This study investigates the assembly line balancing problem (ALBP), considering HRC. This problem, abbreviated ALBP-HRC, arises in advanced manufacturing systems, where humans and collaborative robots share the same workplace and can simultaneously perform tasks in parallel or in collaboration. Driven by the need to solve the more complex assembly line-balancing problems found in the automotive industry, this study aims to address the ALBP-HRC with the cycle time and the number of operators (humans and robots) as the primary and secondary objective, respectively. In addition to the traditional ALBP constraints, the human and robot characteristics, in terms of task times, allowing multiple humans and robots at stations, and their joint/collaborative tasks are formulated into a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. A neighborhood-search simulated annealing (SA) is proposed with customized solution representation and neighborhood search operators designed to fit into the problem characteristics. Furthermore, the proposed SA features an adaptive neighborhood selection mechanism that enables the SA to utilize its exploration history to dynamically choose appropriate neighborhood operators as the search evolves. The proposed MILP and SA are implemented on real cases taken from the automotive industry where stations are designed for HRC. The computational results over different problems show that the adaptive SA produces promising solutions compared to the MILP and other swarm intelligence algorithms, namely genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and artificial bee colony. The comparisons of human/robot versus HRC settings in the case study indicate significant improvement in the productivity of the assembly line when multiple humans and robots with collaborative tasks are permissible at stations. © 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract={Smart machine companions such as artificial intelligence (AI) assistants and collaborative robots are rapidly populating the factory floor. Future factory floor workers will work in teams that include both human co-workers and smart machine actors. The visions of Industry 5.0 describe sustainable, resilient, and human-centered future factories that will require smart and resilient capabilities both from next-generation manufacturing systems and human operators. What kinds of approaches can help design these kinds of resilient human–machine teams and collaborations within them? In this paper, we analyze this design challenge, and we propose basing the design on the joint cognitive systems approach. The established joint cognitive systems approach can be complemented with approaches that support human centricity in the early phases of design, as well as in the development of continuously co-evolving human–machine teams. We propose approaches to observing and analyzing the collaboration in human–machine teams, developing the concept of operations with relevant stakeholders, and including ethical aspects in the design and development. We base our work on the joint cognitive systems approach and propose complementary approaches and methods, namely: actor–network theory, the concept of operations and ethically aware design. We identify their possibilities and challenges in designing and developing smooth human–machine teams for Industry 5.0 manufacturing systems. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Physical Internet (PI) is an open global logistics system of which components are hyperconnected for increased efficiency and sustainability. Digital twin (DT), referring to the virtual representation of a physical object, is well-perceived as a key driver in the development of PI-based Supply Chain Management (SCM). Due to the capabilities of real-time monitoring and evaluation of large-scale complex systems, significant research efforts have been made to exploit values of PI/DT in SCM. Despite this, the current literature remained largely unstructured and scattered due to a lack of systematic literature reviews to synergise research findings, analyse the evolution of research fronts and extract emerging trends in the field. To address this issue, the paper deploys a bibliometric knowledge mapping approach to provide a bird's eye view of the current research status in the PI/DT-SCM area. Using CiteSpace's keyword co-occurrence network, 518 journal articles are clustered into 10 key research streams on PI/DT applications in: job shop scheduling, smart manufacturing design, PI-based SCM, manufacturing virtualisation, information management, sustainability development, data analytics, manufacturing operations management, simulation and optimisation, and assembly process planning. Based on citation burst rate, keywords representing research frontiers of the PI/DT are detected and their temporal evolutions are discussed. Likewise, some identified emerging research trends are production process and system, robotics, computer architecture, and cost. Finally, seven future research directions are suggested, which emphasise on several PI/DT-related issues, including business ecosystem, sustainability development, SC downstream management, cognitive thinking in Industry 5.0, citizen twin in digital society, and SC resilience. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={There is a gap between the “radical” visions for Industry 5.0 and the practical solutions, which are mainly based on enabling technologies, we have seen so far. We still need more practical guidelines and cases to get an understanding of how, or whether Industry 5.0 could be relevant as an approach for manufacturing companies to meet the challenges they are facing. This paper investigates how Industry 5.0 can be the reference for developing capabilities needed for meeting the increasingly challenging market and sustainability requirements. To be able to capture all facets and effects of Industry 5.0, the sustainability, resilience and human centricity principles have to work jointly together aligned with roadmaps. This paper presents a platform for industry 5.0 capability development based upon literature that is tested in two firms in the agricultural industry. “The Core Product Service Platform” describing the products and services to deliver and capabilities needed to become an Industry 5.0 company. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={Recent trends towards Industry 5.0 focus on a sustainable and resilient industry, aiming to make technology and innovation more focused on humans and today’s societal concerns. Consequently, this trend also leads to more sustainable and resilient manufacturing, for which collaborative networks play a main role due to the needed involvement of multiple players, being important to consider a perspective of co-responsibility. Establishing adequate performance indicators to assess how collaborative manufacturing ecosystems can support sustainability is thus relevant. Furthermore, this work also analyses how such performance indicators can be used as an influencing factor contributing to improving the players’ behaviour, representing the idea of co-responsibility for a more sustainable manufacturing network. This article proposes a set of performance indicators and a related simulation model to set up several scenarios to analyse how collaboration can influence sustainability in horizontal manufacturing networks. Results from simulation scenarios are included and discussed. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={Industry 5.0 complements the Industry 4.0 paradigm by highlighting research and innovation as drivers for a transition to a sustainable, human-centric and resilient industry. In this context, new types of interactions between operators and machines are facilitated, that can be realized through artificial intelligence (AI) based and voice-enabled Digital Intelligent Assistants (DIA). Apart from the existing technological challenges, this direction requires new methodologies for the evaluation of such technological solutions that will be able to treat AI in manufacturing as a socio-technical system. In this paper, we propose a framework for the evaluation of voice-enabled AI solutions in Industry 5.0, which consists of four dimensions: the trustworthiness of the AI system; the usability of the DIA; the cognitive workload of individual users; and the overall business benefits for the corporation. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={Despite the fact that Industry 4.0 concepts and technologies are still being developed and still being adopted, the lessons learned from the last decade have helped shape up the notion of Industry 5.0 - as the next ‘revolution’ in industrial domain. Even though Industry 5.0 shared many concepts with Industry 4.0, it is characterized by three main elements, human-centricity, sustainability and resilience. In this paper, we introduce a digital manufacturing platform architecture that extends Industry 4.0 paradigms to enable AI-based decision support with the necessary trustworthiness and human-centricity elements primed for Industry 5.0. The proposed architecture helps realize the balancing act of getting the perceived benefits from AI-centric digitalization while preserving the role of humans in key decision-making activities. © 2022 CEUR-WS.

abstract={Industry 5.0 is a combination of organisational principles and technologies to design and manage operations and supply chains as resilient, sustainable, and human-centric systems. While the general notion of Industry 5.0 has been elaborated, its implications for future operations and supply chains remain underexplored. This paper contributes to the conceptualisation of Industry 5.0 from the perspective of viability. We contextualise a framework of Industry 5.0 through the lens of the viable supply chain model, the reconfigurable supply chain, and human-centric ecosystems. Our study uncovers the major dimensions that characterise Industry 5.0 as a technological-organisational framework. First, the major technological principles of Industry 5.0 are collaboration, coordination, communication, automation, data analytics processing, and identification. Second, Industry 5.0 covers four areas: organisation, management, technology, and performance assessment. Third, Industry 5.0 spans three levels: society level, network level, and plant level. Last but not least, Industry 5.0 frames a new triple bottom line: resilient value creation, human well-being, and sustainable society. We provide a definition of Industry 5.0 and discuss its implications by elaborating on the understanding of value in Industry 5.0, which spans the dimensions of profit, people, and society. We also discuss open research areas. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Smart technologies are not only drivers of economic and societal disruptive changes – they are a chance to shape our future in a beneficial way as enablers of a sustainable, “green” world. They are a means to support the implementation of the 17 UN SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) and the European “Green Deal”. The current crisis (climate change, Ukraine war, just to mention a few causes) has shown that our society and economy are not resilient against such critical changes. One of the approaches is to invest much more in circular economy and sustainable modes of production, transport and living, to reduce dangerous dependencies in all industrial and social areas. On the one hand, a severe economic crisis with shortage of essential resources for people worldwide bears risks of social instability and war, on the other hand, mitigation by smart technologies and high automation including autonomous systems bears a considerable risk to democracy, human rights and self-determination as well. European policy has reacted to the challenges of climate change and environmental footprint reduction particularly in context of production, transport, farming and large urban agglomerations – smartness (intelligence) is not only addressing well-being, assisted living and comfort of citizens (keyword “Society 5.0”), but even more sustainability goals in the long term (“Green and Circular Cities”). © 2022 IDIMT.

abstract={The production control for the mass individualisation paradigm of R&D-stage products is challenging due to the mix-flow and frequently-disturbed environment. With the convergence of the sustainable development goals and the increasing individualised demands in products, resilient manufacturing is envisioned in Industry 5.0 proposition. Concerning that conventional centralised production control methods suffer from low stability and inefficiency of decisions under frequent disruptions, this paper establishes a blockchained smart contract pyramid-driven multi-agent autonomous process control (BSCP-MAAPC) approach for improving the timeliness and adaptability of control towards resilient individualised manufacturing. Firstly, a blockchain-based multi-agent system architecture is designed based on agent encapsulation of manufacturing units. Blockchained smart contracts are used as the enabler of the multi-agent system for peer-to-peer negotiation and coordination of tasks. Secondly, a quad-play blockchained smart contract pyramid together with a series of decentralised control patterns are designed to enable the initial task dispatching of various individualised demands, as well as rapid dynamic adjustment of schedule in response to internal random disruptions. Finally, a blockchained smart contract pyramid-driven multi-agent autonomous process control system prototype is built in the ManuChain system, and experiments are conducted to analyze the proposed BSCP-MAAPC approach in different environments. HIGHLIGHTS A blockchained smart contract pyramid-driven multi-agent autonomous process control (BSCP-MAAPC) approach. A quad-play blockchained smart contract pyramid together with a series of decentralized control patterns. Blockchained smart contracts as the enabler of the multi-agent system for peer-to-peer negotiation and coordination of tasks. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Benefiting from the marriage of just-in-time (JIT) and computer integrated manufacturing (CIM), a series of manufacturing planning and control (MPC) systems has been introduced for contemporary production and operations management. However, the increasing requirements for customized and personalized products and services, together with the acceleration of the socio-economic environment in the age of Industry 4.0, forced manufacturers to re-evaluate their current MPC strategies that mainly emphasize time, cost and quality priorities. Industry 4.0 presents a solid ambition for transforming to a digital, data-driven and interconnected manufacturing industry centred around cyber-physical convergence. Although the relevance of Industry 4.0 technologies' disruptions on operations management has been acknowledged, a significant gap in the evolution of the logic and design of MPC systems has been observed. The requirements of on-demand products and services with enhanced flexibility, resilience, sustainability and humanitarianism in this new industrial revolution call for innovations of MPC architectures and approaches. This paper first summarizes the evolution of MPC systems with enabling technologies and the changing business climate at that time. To explore innovative MPC that complies with the increasing economic, social and environmental requirements, the concept of synchronization-oriented MPC with four principles is proposed. Following the principles, a general framework for the synchronization-oriented MPC with enhanced economic, social and environmental benefits is developed. This work potentially provides insights into innovative MPC in the age of Industry 4.0 and even Industry 5.0. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Quadruple and Quintuple Helix Innovation Systems aim to optimize the design and operation of modern, democratic societies and economies in a smart, sustainable, inclusive, resilient and efficacious manner via the cyber-physical ecosystems that align with Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0 precepts. In this context, the Quintuple Innovation Helix Framework (which is part of the Quadruple/Quintuple Innovation Helix or Q2IH) represents the most comprehensive, meaningful and valuable construct and modality as it encompasses the five key core dimensions of modern, sustainable and democratic knowledge economies and societies. These are the Environment, the Civil Society as well as the Government, University and Industry dimensions. We strongly feel that it is appropriate and even critical, given current events in Europe that starkly highlight the conflict and struggle between democracies and autocracies, to enable, facilitate and even accelerate the further development of an Emerging Unified Theory of Helical Architectures (EUTOHA). The objective would be to bring clarity, coherence and consistency to the process of leveraging the helical architectures to advance and enhance the design of solutions for the digital transformation of modern knowledge economies and societies towards more democratic and sustainable (green) ones. © 2022 by E.G.

abstract={Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) has been gradually valued due to its high prevalence, high risk, and high mortality. This article is to find an alternative to the polysomnography (PSG) OSAHS diagnosis method and assesses the subject's degree of illness considering the supply chain and Industry 5.0 requirement, efficiently, accurately and easily. The blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) signal is used to count the number of apnea or hypoventilation events. It extracts 35-dimensional features based on the time domain to enhance the process resilience, including approximate entropy, Centralized Trend Measurement (CTM), and LZ complexity for the diagnosis process in supply chains. This article summarizes the Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) characteristics. The feature selection process is reduced from 35 to 7 dimensions and benefits the implementation in the practical supply chains in industry 5.0. A 92% accuracy rate is reached in assessing the prevalence of OSAHS, satisfying the industrial deployment. IEEE},

abstract={The recent shift to wellbeing, sustainability, and resilience under Industry 5.0 has prompted formal discussions that manufacturing should be human-centric – placing the wellbeing of industry workers at the center of manufacturing processes, instead of system-centric – only driven by efficiency and quality improvement and cost reduction. However, there is a lack of shared understanding of the essence of human-centric manufacturing, though significant research efforts exist in enhancing the physical and cognitive wellbeing of operators. Therefore, this position paper presents our arguments on the concept, needs, reference model, enabling technologies and system frameworks of human-centric manufacturing, providing a relatable vision and research agenda for future work in human-centric manufacturing systems. We believe human-centric manufacturing should ultimately address human needs defined in an Industrial Human Needs Pyramid – from basic needs of safety and health to the highest level of esteem and self-actualization. In parallel, human-machine relationships will change following a 5C evolution map – from current Coexistence, Cooperation and Collaboration to future Compassion and Coevolution. As such, human-centric manufacturing systems need to have bi-directional empathy, proactive communication and collaborative intelligence for establishing trustworthy human-machine coevolution relationships, thereby leading to high-performance human-machine teams. It is suggested that future research focus should be on developing transparent, trustworthy and quantifiable technologies that provide a rewarding working environment driven by real-world needs. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers},

abstract={Industry 5.0 follows the idea of continuous digitization and transfer to digital factory. Industries must adopt the green and digital transitions to continue to be competitive. Besides the preservation of resources, climate change, the social stability is in the focus. Industries strive to become more resilient against external disturbances, such as Covid-19 crisis. Work environment considerably affects the productivity, health and safety of workers. Monitoring of the working environment with reliable miniaturized technology can guarantee suitable working conditions. In the line with the EU Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work 2014-2020, one of EU-OSHA's priorities is to fortify the prevention of work-related diseases. © 2021, MM publishing Ltd..

abstract={In the past decades, a broad range of technological innovations have helped organizations reach new levels of performance and have shaped the economies of the world and societies of the future. However, unexpected events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the blocking of the Suez Canal, have shown that many organizations are unprepared to deal with the impact of the disturbances that can occur. Thus, organizations are challenged to include resilience in the design of their Information Systems and Enterprise Architectures (EAs). We respond to this challange and propose a five-step method aimed to help organizations design resilient enterprise architectures to be able to better deal with (un-) expected disturbances. Our method builds upon the 'EA resilience by design' paradigm, combines knowledge from several domains, namely resilience, risk analysis, and EA, and leverages the ArchiMate 3.1 language to model several resilience characteristics. Using a case study at a leading manufacturing organization in the agri-food sector in Lithuania, we demonstrate the applicability of our method and draw some early lessons learned based on our very first evaluation with experts. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has shown industries all around the world that their current manufacturing systems are not as resilient as expected and therefore many are failing. The workforce is the most agile and flexible manufacturing resource and simultaneously the most fragile one due to its humanity. By making human operators more resilient against a range of factors affecting their work and workplaces, enterprises can make their manufacturing systems more resilient. This paper introduces "The Resilient Operator 5.0" concept, based on human operator resilience and human-machine systems' resilience, providing a vision for the future of work in smart resilient manufacturing systems in the emerging Industry 5.0 hallmark. It suggests how to achieve appropriate smart manufacturing systems' resilience from a human-centric perspective through the means of the Operator 4.0 typology and its related technical solutions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

abstract={Industry 5.0 follows the steps of the Industry 4.0 paradigm and seeks for revolutionizing the way industries operate. In fact, Industry 5.0 focuses on research and innovation to support industrial production sustainability and place the well-being of industrial workers at the center of the production process. Thus, Industry 5.0 relies on three pillars: It is human-centric, it encourages sustainability and it is aimed at developing resilience against disruptions. Such core aspects cannot be fully achieved without a transparent end-to-end human-centered traceability throughout the value chain. As a consequence, Auto-Identification (Auto-ID) technologies play a key role, since they are able to provide automated item recognition, positioning and tracking without human intervention or in cooperation with industrial operators. Although the most popular Auto-ID technologies provide a certain degree of security and productivity, there are still open challenges for future Industry 5.0 factories. This article analyzes and evaluates the Auto-ID landscape and delivers a holistic perspective and understanding of the most popular and the latest technologies, looking for solutions that cope with harsh, diverse and complex industrial scenarios. In addition, it describes a methodology for selecting Auto-ID technologies for Industry 5.0 factories. Such a methodology is applied to a specific use case of the shipbuilding industry that requires identifying the main components of a ship during its construction and repair. To validate the outcomes of the methodology, a practical evaluation of passive and active UHF RFID tags was performed in an Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV) under construction, showing that a careful selection and evaluation of the tags enables product identification and tracking even in areas with a very high density of metallic objects. As a result, this article serves as a useful guide for industrial stakeholders, including future developers and managers that seek for deploying identification and traceability technologies in Industry 5.0 scenarios. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The fifth industrial revolution brings in massive advantages, providing candidates with a more personalized experience in their job search. Industry 5.0 recognizes the power of industry in achieving societal goals beyond jobs and growth to become a resilient provider of prosperity by directing production towards respecting the boundaries of our planet and placing the well-being of the industry worker at the center of the production process. Contrary to the trends in Industry 4.0 toward technology, dehumanization, technological advancement and innovation best practices, Industry 5.0 will bend back toward serving humanity. At workplaces, this industrial revolution will shed greater light on the human intelligence than ever. The challenge now is to examine the influence of soft skills to enhance the workforce in order to prepare them for Industry 5.0. Emotional intelligence is a soft skill. The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of emotional intelligence on enhancing the workforce for Industry 5.0. A total of 110 executives took part in this study. Findings suggest that emotional intelligence does influence the workforce to perform better. Emotional recognition and expression and emotions direct cognition were found to have a greater impact on the performance. Copyright © 2021. Susan Tee Suan CHIN.},

abstract={Smart and (partially) autonomous systems are today's drivers of innovation and economic respectively societal disruptive changes: in all industrial and social areas highly automated or autonomous intelligent systems are taking over tasks and services - and maybe, one day, control of our lives. This is a considerable risk to democracy, human independence and human rights, raising ethical questions. However, conventional technologies have also an impact, particularly on excessive exploitation of natural resources, climate change and inequality in global economy and society. The concept of circular economy became a focus when thinking about a more sustainable future. We are now seeing many communities and businesses adopt novel approaches based on circularity. European policy has reacted to the challenges of climate change and environmental footprint reduction particularly in context of production, transport, farming and large urban agglomerations - smartness (intelligence) is not only addressing well-being, assisted living and comfort of citizens (keyword “Society 5.0”), but even more sustainability goals in the long term. The European Green Deal is a commitment to future generations, while the European Green Cities movement addresses many of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and manages a network of cities for collaboration and experience exchange by developing innovative projects. © 2021 IDIMT 2021 - Pandemics: Impacts, Strategies and Responses, 29th Interdisciplinary Information Management Talks All rights reserved.},
