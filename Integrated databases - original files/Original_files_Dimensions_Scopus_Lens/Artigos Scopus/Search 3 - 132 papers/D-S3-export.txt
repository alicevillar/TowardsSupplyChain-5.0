ABSTRACT: Nowadays, Industries are experiencing rapid changes in the digital environment, referred to as Industry 5.0. The Internet of Things (IoT) and advanced technologies are essential in the industrial environment. Technological advancements can collect, transfer, and analyze vast amounts of data in the industry via promising technologies. Still, IoT has various issues when applied to industrial infrastructures, such as centralization, privacy preservation, latency, and security. This article proposes a scheme as FusionFedBlock: Fusion of Blockchain and Federated Learning to Preserve Privacy in Industry 5.0 to address the aforementioned issues. At the federated layer, the industry's departments (Production, Quality Control, Distribution) allow local learning updates with network automation and communicate to the global model, which miners verify in the Blockchain networks. Federated-Learning offers privacy preservation between various mentioned departments in industries. Decentralized secure storage is provided by the Distributed Hash Table (DHT) at the cloud layer. The validation outcomes of the proposed scheme demonstrate excellent performance as the accuracy of 93.5% in a 50% active node for Industry 5.0 compared to existing frameworks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: According to the Industry 5.0 framework, the smart factory should combine digitalization and prediction activities with a greater sustainability and human centrality within working processes. Indeed, the optimization and improvement of the manufacturing processes have to meet cost criteria related to energy consumption, safety, and implementation of new technologies. The development of better and more advanced technologies boosts Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) in the manufacturing processes. However, due to the high number of safety standards about collaborative robotics and the absence of tools and specific design approaches, collaborative robots (cobots) are still widely adopted as traditional industrial robots wasting the huge potential of a properly Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC). The layout designing is a crucial activity in achieving a proper and effective HRC. This work illustrates how to transfer standard-compliant layout solutions towards an interactive three-dimensional (3D) visualization environment in order to enable the digital prototyping of HRC workplaces. The possibility to automatically generate and visualize multiple layout solutions of collaborative workplaces, and then, to simulate the interaction between human and robot, represents one of the most significant tasks during the designing process. HRC workplace layout is designed according to an optimization criterion, by using the full integration of a numerical computing platform with an interactive 3D visualization environment. Then, by means of the variation of the input parameters, the visualization of new layout solutions is enabled in a fast and effective way. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: Zero defect manufacturing (ZDM) aims at eliminating defects throughout the value stream as well as the cost of rework and scrap. The ambitious goal of zero defects requires the extensive utilization of emerging technologies. Amidst the major drive for technological advancement, humans are often kept out of the loop because they are perceived as the root cause of error. The report from the European Commission on Industry 5.0 emphasizes that human-centric is a key pillar in building a more resilient industry and is vital to incorporate the human component into the manufacturing sector. However, we did not find any publications that explain what human-centric ZDM is, nor what the roles of humans are in advancing ZDM. As a contribution to bridging this gap, a systematic literature review is conducted using different databases. We collected 36 publications and categorised them into 3 different human roles which are managers, engineers, and operators. From our search, we found out that managers play a vital role in cultivating ZDM in the entire organization to prevent errors despite the fact they often do not have direct contact with the production line as operators. Operators can help advance ZDM through knowledge capturing with feedback functions to the engineer to better design a corrective action to prevent errors. Assistive technologies such as extended reality are efficient tools used by operators to eliminate human errors in production environments. Human-centric is now a goal in the future manufacturing sector, but it could face barriers such as high technological investments and resistance to changes in their work tasks. This paper can contribute to paving the roadmap of human-centric ZDM to bring defects to zero and reposition the manufacturing sector to become more resilient. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: In order to realize the goals of Industry 5.0 (I5.0), which has data interoperability as one of its core principles, the future research in the Supply Chain (SC) visibility has to be aligned with socially, economically and environmentally sustainable objectives. Within the purview of circular economy, this paper indicates various aspects and implications of data sharing in the SCs in light of the published research. Taking into consideration the heterogeneity of data sources and standards, this article also catalogs all the major data-sharing technologies being employed in sharing data digitally across the SCs. Drawing on the published research from 2015 to 2021, following the PRISMA framework, this paper presents the state of research in the field of data sharing in SCs in terms of their standardization, optimization, simulation, automation, security and more notably sustainability. Using the co-occurrence metric, bibliometric analysis has been conducted such that the collected research is categorized under various keyword clusters and regional themes. This article brings together two major themes in reviewing the research in the field. Firstly, the bibliometric analysis of the published articles demonstrates the contours of the current state of research and the future possibilities in the field. Secondly, in synthesizing the research on the foundations of sustainability within the CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework, this article deals with various aspects and implications of information sharing in the SCs. By bringing these two themes together, this paper affords a prospective researcher with the research vis-à-vis the information sharing in SC, starting from the actual data standards in use to the modality and consequence of their application within the perspective of the circular economy. This article, in essence, indicates how all the aspects of data sharing in SCs may be brought together in service of the paradigm of I5.0. © 2022

ABSTRACT: The European Commission defined the new concept of Industry 5.0 meaning a more human-centric, resilient, and sustainable approach for the design of industrial systems and operations. A deep understanding of the work environment and organization is important to start analysing the working conditions and the resulting User eXperience (UX) of the operators. Also, the knowledge about users’ needs and ergonomics is fundamental to optimize the workers’ wellbeing, working conditions, and industrial results. In this context, the paper presents a strategy to effectively assess the UX of workers to promote human-centric vision of manufacturing sites, enhancing the overall sustainability of the modern factories. A set of non-invasive wearable devices is used to monitor human activities and collect physiological parameters, as well as questionnaires to gather subjective self-assessment. This set-up was applied to virtual reality (VR) simulation, replicating heavy duty work sequence tasks that took place in an oil and gas pipes manufacturing site. This approach allowed the identification of possible stressful conditions for the operator, from physical and mental perspectives, which may compromise the performance.

ABSTRACT: The digital transformation of production (“Industry 4.0”) has the potential to enormously accelerate and improve the efficiency of manufacturing processes and value chains. But it also entails recruiting new employees, as well as re- and upskilling current employees of diverse ages groups for new and increasingly more complex tasks to manage increasingly more complex information. In this article we present an overview and meta perspective on serious games as a human-centric methodology. We discuss how these can contribute to 1) learning how operators react to complex situations and how they deal with incomplete, uncertain, or fuzzy information, 2) understanding how operators of production systems and production networks can be supported by human-centric industrial user interfaces, and 3) enable operators to act appropriately in complex and dynamic cyber-physical production systems. We present an actionable adaptable iterative process model for designing serious games and exemplify this model using a supply chain and quality management serious game. Further, we present empirical studies that illustrate the application of the model and suggest the utility of serious games as a learning environment, to evaluate industrial user interfaces, and to investigate human behavior in complex production environments. As such, we propose serious games as a versatile methodology to facilitate transitioning from Industry 4.0 (data-driven and interconnected) to Industry 5.0 (humane work and sustainability). © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Recent advances in materials modelling, characterization and materials informatics suggest that deep integration of such methods can be a crucial aspect of the Industry 5.0 revolution, where the fourth industrial revolution paradigms are combined with the concepts of transition to a sustainable, human-centric and resilient industry. We pose a specific deep integration challenge beyond the ordinary multidisciplinary modelling/characterization research approach in this short communication with research and innovation as drivers for scientific excellence. Full integration can be achieved by developing common ontologies across different domains, enabling meaningful computational and experimental data integration and interoperability. On this basis, fine-tuning of adaptive materials modelling/characterization protocols can be achieved and facilitate computational and experimental efforts. Such interoperable and meaningful data combined with advanced data science tools (including machine learning and artificial intelligence) become a powerful asset for materials scientists to extract complex information from the large amount of data generated by last generation characterization techniques. To achieve this ambitious goal, significant collaborative actions are needed to develop common, usable, and sharable digital tools that allow for effective and efficient twinning of data and workflows across the different materials modelling and characterization domains. © 2022

ABSTRACT: The adoption of Digital Twin (DT) solutions for industrial purposes is increasing among small- and medium-sized enterprises and is already being integrated into many large-scale companies. As there is an increasing need for faster production and shortening of the learning curve for new emerging technologies, Virtual Reality (VR) interfaces for enterprise manufacturing DTs seem to be a good solution. Furthermore, with the emergence of Industry 5.0 (I5.0) paradigm, human operators will be increasingly integrated in the systems interfaces though advanced interactions, pervasive sensors, real time tracking and data acquisition. This scenario is especially relevant in collaborative automated systems where the introduction of immersive VR interfaces based on production cell DTs might provide a solution for the integration of the human factors in the modern industrial scenarios. This study presents experimental results of the comparison between users controlling a physical industrial robot system via a traditional teach pendant and a DT leveraging a VR user interface. The study group involves forty subjects including experts in robotics and VR as well as non-experts. An analysis of the data gathered in both the real and the virtual use case scenario is provided. The collected information includes time for performing a task with an industrial robot, stress level evaluation, physical and mental effort, and the human subjects’ perceptions of the physical and simulated robots. Additionally, operator gazes were tracked in the VR environment. In this study, VR interfaces in the DT representation are exploited to gather user centered metrics and validate efficiency and safety standards for modern collaborative industrial systems in I5.0. The goal is to evaluate how the operators perceive and respond to the virtual robot and user interface while interacting with them and detect if any degradation of user experience and task efficiency exists compared to the real robot interfaces. Results demonstrate that the use of DT VR interfaces is comparable to traditional tech pendants for the given task and might be a valuable substitute of physical interfaces. Despite improving the overall task performance and considering the higher stress levels detected while using the DT VR interface, further studies are necessary to provide a clearer validation of both interfaces and user impact assessment methods. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Industry 5.0 blows the whistle on global industrial transformation. It aims to place humans’ well-being at the center of manufacturing systems, thereby achieving social goals beyond employment and growth to provide prosperity robustly for the sustainable development of all humanity. However, the current exploration of Industry 5.0 is still in its infancy where research findings are relatively scarce and little systematic. This paper first reviews the evolutionary vein of Industry 5.0 and three leading characteristics of Industry 5.0: human-centricity, sustainability, and resiliency. The connotation system of Industry 5.0 is discussed, and its diversified essence is analyzed. Then, this paper constructs a tri-dimension system architecture for implementing Industry 5.0, namely, the technical dimension, reality dimension, and application dimension. The paper further discusses key enablers, the future implementation path, potential applications, and challenges of realistic scenarios of Industry 5.0. Finally, the limitations of the current research are discussed with potential future research directions highlighted. It is expected that this review work will arouse lively discussions and debates, and bring together the strengths of all beings for building a comprehensive system of Industry 5.0. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers

ABSTRACT: This article aims at contributing to the celebration of the 25th Anniversary of Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review (TRE). It provides an overview of the role of Facility Location in Logistics and Transportation highlighting the contribution of TRE to such an enduring relationship. Several conventional problems are revisited showing that the three above fields have been intertwined for a long time. Nevertheless, the role of Facility Location has become even stronger in the past decades due to challenges posed by new technological developments together with a fast economy globalization and a strong increase in environmental concerns. This has called for the study of more complex problems and the development of comprehensive mathematical models leading to major advances in areas such as reverse and green logistics, humanitarian supply chains, and multimodal transportation, to mention a few. These and other related topics are discussed. Hedging against uncertainty has gained much practical relevance and thus it will be much in focus throughout the paper. Several current trends and future challenges are thoroughly discussed. These include but are not limited to the steps already made and those still missing for paving the way from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0, as well as the challenges posed by data-driven decision making in the Era of big data. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: 5G-and-beyond (B5G) networks are moving toward the higher end of the millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum (i.e., from 25 to 100 GHz) to support integrated communications and ranging (ICAR) services in next-generation factory deployments. The ICAR services in factory deployments require extreme bandwidth/capacity and large ranging coverage, which a mmWave-B5G system can fulfill using massive multi-input and multioutput (mMIMO), beamforming, and advanced ranging techniques. However, as mmWave signal propagation is sensitive to harsh channel conditions experienced in typical indoor factory environments, there is a growing interest in the realistic mmWave indoor channel modeling to evaluate the practical scope of the mmWave-B5G systems. In this article, we study and implement a 3-D stochastic channel model using the baseline third-generation partnership project model. Our channel model employs the time-cluster spatial-lobe (TCSL) technique and utilizes the temporal and spatial statistics to create the channel impulse response (CIR), reflecting realistic indoor factory conditions. Using the generated CIR, we present the performance analysis of an mmWave-B5G system in terms of power delay profile, path loss, communication and ranging coverage, and mMIMO channel capacity. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: The world is heading in the wrong direction on carbon emissions where we are not on track to limit global warming to 1.5 °C; Ireland is among the countries where overall emissions have continued to rise. The development of wettable peatland products and services (termed ‘Paludiculture’) present significant opportunities for enabling a transition away from peat-harvesting (fossil fuels) to developing ‘green’ eco-innovations. However, this must be balanced with sustainable carbon sequestration and environmental protection. This complex transition from ‘brown to green’ must be met in real time by enabling digital technologies across the full value chain. This will potentially necessitate creation of new green-business models with the potential to support disruptive innovation. This timely paper describes digital transformation of paludiculture-based eco-innovation that will potentially lead to a paradigm shift towards using smart digital technologies to address efficiency of products and services along with future-proofing for climate change. Digital transform of paludiculture also aligns with the ‘Industry 5.0 - a human-centric solution’. However, companies supporting peatland innovation may lack necessary standards, data-sharing or capabilities that can also affect viable business model propositions that can jeopardize economic, political and social sustainability. Digital solutions may reduce costs, increase productivity, improve produce develop, and achieve faster time to market for paludiculture. Digitisation also enables information systems to be open, interoperable, and user-friendly. This constitutes the first study to describe the digital transformation of paludiculture, both vertically and horizontally, in order to inform sustainability that includes process automation via AI, machine learning, IoT-Cloud informed sensors and robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and blockchain for cyber-physical systems. Thus, the aim of this paper is to describe the applicability of digital transformation to actualize the benefits and opportunities of paludiculture activities and enterprises in the Irish midlands with a global orientation. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The rise of the fourth industrial revolution aspires to digitize any traditional manufacturing process, paving the way for new organisation schemes and management principles that affect business models, the environment, and services across the entire value chain. During the last two decades, the generated advancements have been analysed and discussed from a bunch of technological and business perspectives gleaned from a variety of academic journals. With the aim to identify the digital footprint of Industry 4.0 in the current manufacturing ecosystem, a systematic literature survey of surveys is conducted here, based on survey academic articles that cover the current state-of-the-art. The 59 selected high-impact survey manuscripts are analysed using PRISMA principles and categorized according to their technologies under analysis and impact, providing valuable insights for the research and business community. Specifically, the influence Industry 4.0 exerts on traditional business models, small and medium-sized enterprises, decision-making processes, human–machine interaction, and circularity affairs are investigated and brought out, while research gaps, business opportunities, and their relevance to Industry 5.0 principles are pointed out. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: In the era of Industry 4.0, manufacturing and production systems were revolutionized by increasing operational efficiency and developing and implementing new business models, services, and products. Concretely, the milestone set for Industry 4.0 was to improve the sustainability and efficiency of production systems. By extension, the emphasis was focused on both the digitization and the digitalization of systems, providing room for further improvement. However, the current technological evolution is more system/machine-oriented, rather than human-oriented. Thus, several countries have begun orchestrating initiatives towards the design and development of the human-centric aspect of technologies, systems, and services, which has been coined as Industry 5.0. The impact of Industry 5.0 will extend to societal transformation, which eventually leads to the generation of a new society, the Society 5.0. The developments will be focused on the social and human-centric aspect of the tools and technologies introduced under the framework of Industry 4.0. Therefore, sustainability and human well-being will be at the heart of what comes next, the Industry 5.0, as a subset of Society 5.0. Industry 5.0 will build on the foundations laid during Industry 4.0 by emphasizing human-centered, resilient, and sustainable design. Consequently, the authors in this research work, through a critical literature review, aim to provide adequate reasoning for considering Industry 5.0 as a framework for enabling the coexistence of industry and emerging societal trends and needs. The contribution of this research work extends to the provision of a framework to facilitate the transition from Industry 4.0 to Society 5.0. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The Digital Transformation (DX) megatrend is fundamentally disrupting and changing the nature of work, business, and industry at a rapid pace. Although the notion of DX has garnered much research interest from practitioners, scholarship on this topic is somehow lagging behind, possibly because of the lack of theoretical frameworks on DX. Recently, most Japanese firms have begun to use diverse digital technologies to sustain their competitive advantages. However, the return of investment on digital technologies has not been as high as expected for some firms. Furthermore, as the visions of Industry 5.0 describe sustainable, resilient, and human-centered future factories that will require smart and resilient capabilities both from next-generation manufacturing systems and human operators, it is necessary to design resilient human–machine collaborations within factories. To this end, this paper presents a research model between DX technologies and scientific problem-solving in terms of deduction, induction, and abduction inference structures as an approach to resilient human–machine collaborations. The purpose of this research is to analyze the difference in the utilization pattern of the digital technology of American, German, and Japanese firms based on three types of decision-making methods. Next, we apply this framework in a comparative case study of two Japanese firms and one German firm, where we find that there is a difference in DX technologies utilization among the Japanese and German firms. We assert that the utilization of IoT technology in the United States and Germany is pursuing IoT with the aim of autonomous control, whereas Japanese firms prioritize robot–human collaboration. Finally, we discuss how our findings contribute to the burgeoning field of resilient human–machine collaborations by showing the distinct roles of deduction, induction, and abduction inference structures. Furthermore, our research contributes to international comparative studies to identify the difference in national IT utilization. Lessons and implications are discussed. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Scholars believe that the newly introduced Industry 5.0 has the potential to move beyond the profit-centered productivity of Industry 4.0 and to promote sustainable development goals such as human-centricity, socio-environmental sustainability, and resilience. However, little has been done to understand how this ill-defined phenomenon may deliver its indented sustainability values despite these speculative promises. To address this knowledge gap, the present study developed a strategy roadmap that explains the mechanism by which Industry 5.0 delivers its intended sustainable development functions. The study first developed and introduced the Industry 5.0 reference model that describes the technical and functional properties of this phenomenon. The study further conducted a content-centric synthesis of the literature and identified the sustainable development functions of Industry 5.0. Next, the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique was employed to identify the sequential relationships among the functions and construct the Industry 5.0-enabled model of sustainable development. The ISM involved collecting the opinions of 11 Industry 5.0 experts through expert panel meetings. Results revealed that Industry 5.0 delivers sustainable development values through 16 functions. Circular intelligent products, employee technical assistance, intelligent automation, open sustainable innovation, renewable integration, and supply chain adaptability are examples of the functions identified. These functions are highly interrelated and should be developed in a specific order so that the synergies and complementarities among them would maximize the sustainable development value gains. The roadmap to Industry 5.0-driven sustainability developed in this study is expected to provide a better understanding of ways Industry 5.0 can contribute to sustainable development, explaining how the development of its functions should be managed to maximize their synergies and contribution to the intended sustainability values. The study also highlights important avenues for future research, emphasizing the potential enablers of Industry 5.0 development, such as Government 5.0 or Corporate Governance 5.0. © 2022

ABSTRACT: For an understanding of the concept of the Quadruple and Quintuple Helix Innovation Systems, it is essential to realize that the Quadruple and Quintuple Helices are based on democracy and ecology. This has two implications: (1) the further advancement and evolution of knowledge and innovation are requiring a co-evolution with democracy or knowledge democracy, and (2) ecology, ecological sensitivity, and environmental protection are a necessity for the survival of humanity, but they should also be regarded as drivers for further knowledge production and innovation development. This implies that for an innovation system to be a Quadruple and Quintuple Helix Innovation System, the government and the political system, addressing the innovation system, must be democratic in substance, and not only in form. This indicates how a Quadruple and Quintuple Helix differs from Triple Helix approaches to innovation. Furthermore, within the framework of Quadruple and Quintuple Helix, the “Democracy of Climate” for innovation and the “Democracy of Knowledge” are combined together in creating a nexus. Implications for strategy, policy, and practice are manifold, also incorporating aspects of Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Despite the current slowdown in global economic growth due to the impact of COVID-19, the digital economy is still performing well. Under the background of double carbon, green innovation and intelligent production of manufacturing enterprises have become the general trend of sustainable development. It is particularly important to study the integration of digital technology into green innovation and production processes to improve the performance of digital green innovation and the competitiveness of enterprises. However, the integration of digital technology and green innovation from the perspective of knowledge management has not been fully introduced into current literatures. In this study, hierarchical regression and fsQCA approaches were used to empirically verify the adoption process of digital green innovation activities and the impact of digital green knowledge creation on digital green innovation performance (DGIP), and explores the moderating effects of digital green risk perception (DGRP) and digital green complexity perception (DGCC) through 429 questionnaires from Chinese manufacturing enterprises. In addition, knowledge search is divided into three dimensions: scientific digital green knowledge search (SDGKS), market digital green knowledge search (MDGKS) and supply chain digital green knowledge search (SCDGKS). The results show that: i) SDGKS promotes exploitative digital green knowledge creation (EDGKC). MDGKS has a positive impact on both utilizing digital green knowledge creation (ADGKC) and EDGKC. SCDGKS promotes EDGKC. ii) The relationship between SDGKS and EDGKC is only moderated by DGCC (positive). The relationship between MDGKS and EDGKC is only moderated by DGCC (negative). The relationship between SCDGKS and EDGKC is moderated by DGRP (negative) and DGCC (negative). iii) There is an inverted U-shaped relationship between ADGKC and DGIP. There is a U-shaped relationship between EDGKC and DGIP. The essence of this study is to help manufacturing enterprises find external partners to improve their digital green innovation performance through external knowledge search partner selection. The conclusion of this study has certain theoretical contribution to the clarification of the complex process of digital green innovation. This study provides a theoretical basis for enterprises to select knowledge search partners according to their own environment to carry out digital green innovation activities smoothly. This study has practical value for enterprises to improve competitiveness, better survival and development process under the current environment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Purpose: This study aims to empirically examine the effect of supply chain innovation (SCI) announcements on shareholder value within the context of Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses an event study method to examine the effect of SCI announcements on shareholder value of the 156 listed companies in China. Findings: First, SCI announcements have a positive effect on shareholder value. Second, SCI with an integrated form more positively affects shareholder value than SCI with an independent form. SCI at the strategy level more positively affects shareholder value than SCI at the operation level. Technology-type SCI more positively affects shareholder value than process-type SCI. Third, this study finds that investors pay more attention to the SCI of companies in the service industry than that of in the manufacturing industry. Finally, the post-hoc analysis finds that digital SCI more positively affects shareholder value than intelligent SCI. Originality/value: First, most scholars use questionnaire data rather than second-hand data to conduct empirical research to explore the impact of SCI on performance. Second, although scholars focus on performance comprehensively, including operational, financial, relational and environmental performance, no scholars use an event study to explore the impact of SCI on the stock market. Third, no scholars have explored the differential impact of SCI in different industries. Forth, few scholars have classified SCI according to the characteristics to explore the differential impact of SCI. Finally, the differences between SCI of Industry 4.0 and SCI of Industry 5.0 have been described, but no scholars have used empirical research to explore the differences. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Under the background of double carbon target and digital intelligence era, the innovation resources and innovation environment that manufacturing enterprises rely on have shown exponential growth. Digital green innovation (DGI) has gradually become the mainstream paradigm of innovation. How to achieve a balance between a local DGI network (LDGIN) and a remote DGI network (RDGIN) and how to use the role of digital empowerment and green organization flexibility to improve the performance of DGI are very important issues facing manufacturing enterprises at present. However, this problem has not been fully addressed in the existing research. In this study, the influence mechanism of LDGIN and RDGIN on the DGI performance of manufacturing enterprises was revealed, considering the moderating role of digital empowerment and green organization flexibility. The linear regression method was used to analyze the 562 valid data obtained by questionnaire survey. The results of this study are as follows. The effect of the DGI network on manufacturing enterprises’ DGI performance is heterogeneous because of LDGIN and RDGIN. The establishment of embedded links in a DGI network inevitably requires manufacturing enterprises to pay the corresponding costs. The over‐embedding of manufacturing enterprises into RDGIN will have a negative impact on DGI performance. The balance between LDGIN and RDGIN has an important impact on manufacturing enterprises’ operation. The comprehensive balance and relative balance indexes constructed in this paper show that an appropriate balance can promote the improvement of the DGI performance of manufacturing enterprises. Digital transformation and organizational structure innovation are changing the business model of manufacturing enterprises and can regulate the relationship between the LDGIN and RDGIN and the DGI performance of manufacturing enterprises. The balance of DGI network embedding in practice shows the important role and enlightening significance of local and remote search in developing countries. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The fifth industrial revolution (Industry 5.0) integrates humans and machines to satisfy the increasing customization demands of the manufacturing complexity using an optimized robotized manufacturing process. Industry 5.0 make use of collaborative robots (cobots) for optimizing productivity and ensuring safety. At the same time, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are predicted to be the main part of industry 5.0 in the forthcoming days. Regardless of high mobility and energy-limited UAVs for wireless communication as significant advantages, different issues are also existing in the UAV networks, such as security, reliability, etc. Several research works have focused on resolving security issues in UAV communication to support safety-critical applications. With this motivation, this article presents an artificial intelligence-based UAV-borne secure communication with classification (AIUAV-SCC) framework for industry 5.0 environment. The proposed AIUAV-SCC model involves two major phases namely image steganography-based secure communication and deep learning (DL)-based classification. At the initial stage, a new image steganography technique with multilevel discrete wavelet transformation, quantum bacterial colony optimization based optimal pixel selection, and encryption processes take place. Next, in the second stage, the Bayesian optimization (BO)-based SqueezeNet model is applied for the classification of securely received UAV images where the parameters in the SqueezeNet method are optimally tuned by the utilize of the BO technique. To validate the performance of the presented model, extensive simulations are applied using the UC Merced dataset (UCM) aerial dataset and the outcomes are investigated under several dimensions. The outcomes make sure the goodness of the presented model on test UCM aerial dataset over the compared methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: In the context of Industry 5.0, in this article, we study the cyber-physical-social systems in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) based on the task background of transmission line project acceptance. First, based on the idea of a parallel system, a parallel UAV planning system for transmission line project acceptance tasks is developed. The mathematical model based on swarm intelligence is then constructed from the multidimensional perspective of improving the acceptance efficiency, shortening the acceptance time, and reducing the energy consumption. This is done based on the physical system data while considering the constraints of UAVs in performing acceptance tasks. Experiments are simulated based on the actual environment data of the quality supervision and acceptance of a 500 kV transmission line project in a plateau area before it is put into production. The obtained results are compared with those of other similar cutting-edge algorithms. The efficiency and practicality of the proposed artificial parallel planning system are finally verified. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: The industry is a key driver of economic development. However, changes caused by introduction of modern technologies, and increasing complexity of products and production, directly affect the industrial enterprises and workers. The critics of the Industry 4.0 paradigm emphasized its orientation to new technologies and digitalization in a technocratic way. Therefore, the new industrial paradigm Industry 5.0 appeared very soon and automatically triggered a debate about the role of, and reasons for applying, the new paradigm. Industry 5.0 is complementing the existing Industry 4.0 paradigm with the orientation to the worker who has an important role in the production process, and that role has been emphasized during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this research, there is a brief discussion on main drivers and enablers for introduction of these new paradigms, then a literature-based analysis is carried out to highlight the differences between two paradigms from three important aspects—people, organization, and technology. The conclusion emphasizes the main features and concerns regarding the movement towards Industry 5.0, and the general conclusion is that there is a significant change of the main research aims from sustainability towards human-centricity. At the end, the analysis of maturity models that evaluates enterprises’ readiness to introduce features of new paradigms is given as well. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: In this paper we introduce a research agenda to guide the development of the next generation of Discrete Event Simulation (DES) systems. Interfaces to digital twins are projected to go beyond physical representations to become blueprints for the actual “objects” and an active dashboard for their control. The role and importance of real-time interactive animations presented in an Extended Reality (XR) format will be explored. The need for using game engines, particularly their physics engines and AI within interactive simulated Extended Reality is expanded on. Importing and scanning real-world environments is assumed to become more efficient when using AR. Exporting to VR and AR is recommended to be a default feature. A technology framework for the next generation simulators is presented along with a proposed set of implementation guidelines. The need for more human centric technology approaches, nascent in Industry 4.0, are now central to the emerging Industry 5.0 paradigm; an agenda that is discussed in this research as part of a human in the loop future, supported by DES. The potential role of Explainable Artificial Intelligence is also explored along with an audit trail approach to provide a justification of complex and automated decision-making systems with relation to DES. A technology framework is proposed, which brings the above together and can serve as a guide for the next generation of holistic simulators for manufacturing. © 2022

ABSTRACT: The contemporary world becomes more and more volatile and unpredictable every year (dynamic development of technology—Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0, dynamic global changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic, great changes in consumer behavior, climate crisis, geopolitical disruptions). Individuals, companies, and supply chains face challenges emerging from economic, sociological, and political phenomena. These phenomena disrupt regular performance and limit the efficient functioning of companies and economies. Due to numerous relations and connections in the economy, disruptions in one area affect the others and spread, growing in range and severity. Hence, disruptions should be dealt with to provide continuity of supply chains and to ensure their efficient and effective performance. The study aims to identify crucial characteristics of disruptions to facilitate disruption minimization strategies. The characteristics of disruptions in supply chains are identified based on a literature review, synthesized and validated by the experts. A study is implemented to validate identified characteristics and to confront theoretical findings with the practical experience and observations of the experts. The results of the study are discussed and commented on. The conclusions from the study refer to the nature and characteristics of disruptions in the contemporary economy, equipping managers with useful knowledge when dealing with disruptions, and academics with observations that can stimulate further discussion on stability, flexibility, and resilience of companies and supply chains. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a cost-effective method to support the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and is an enabling technology for Industry 5.0. The use of RFID is particularly suited to IIoT as it does not require a line of sight for communication and can be retroactively affixed to non-smart items. However, RFID communication is affected by the properties of the material the tag is affixed to, specifically the material permittivity. Metal is commonly present in smart factory environments and supply chains and impedes RFID communication. A suitable tag design is required to accommodate these challenges and ensure resilience for Industry 5.0 applications. The research presented in this paper has assessed the communication performance of RFID antenna designs with and without metal present beneath the tag. The RFID tag designs that performed reliably in the simulation were manufactured, and their read range was tested on materials of varying relative permittivity and thickness to represent MP and NMP scenarios. The results have verified the robustness of “Cyber” to “Physical” designs and provide recommendations to support practitioner IIoT tag selection. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In the next years, it will be increasingly important to re-think manufacturing and logistics systems from a human-centred perspective to promote a balanced use of automation and digital technologies to enhance the unique and irreplaceable capabilities of operators, who will continue to play a fundamental role in the factories of the future. The sixteen papers published in this special issue aim at contributing to the main emerging research streams about human-technology integration in the next-generation manufacturing and logistics systems. In particular, four main macro-topics have emerged: human-machine integration, human-robot collaboration, worker assistance systems and work design 4.0. In the papers, novel conceptual frameworks and architectures are presented and laboratory tests are carried out, promoting relevant advances in the field of human-technology integration. Nevertheless, the analysis of the papers in the special issue reveals that it is still necessary to investigate and explore human-technology integration, especially by developing interfaces that increasingly support the operators. At the same time, it is necessary to rethink the traditional workforce, taking more account of human factors, which intervene in the tasks of operators and managers in order to increase technology acceptability and usage. As a result, there is a growing need to move towards Industry 5.0, with human-centred and socially sustainable design and development of new manufacturing and logistics solutions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Over the years, organizations have had to adapt to constant changes in their surroundings. To this end, they began to adopt methodologies such as lean manufacturing and Industry 4.0. Their implementation has increased the competitiveness of organizations. Sustainability is getting much attention, leading to the advent of Industry 5.0, which, unlike Industry 4.0, takes sustainable production into account. Forestry sectors are significant for the Portuguese economy, especially cork. This study examines a company in the cork sector to determine how automation and monetization of new resources could increase efficiency, quality, and safety. A qualitative approach was applied in the study through literature review and participant observation actions to analyze and propose improvements. The study fulfilled the purposes defined, identifying options to improve the production process and increase customer satisfaction and worker safety. © 2021, IGI Global. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Industry 4.0 is moving forward under technology upgrades, utilizing information technology to improve the intelligence of the industry, whereas Industry 5.0 is value-driven, aiming to focus on essential societal needs, values, and responsibility. The manufacturing industry is currently moving towards the integration of productivity enhancements and sustainable human employment. Such a transformation has deeply changed the human–machine interaction (HMI), among which digital twin (DT) and extended reality (XR) are two cutting-edge technologies. A manufacturing DT offers an opportunity to simulate, monitor, and optimize the machine. In the meantime, XR empowers HMI in the industrial field. This paper presents an XR application framework for DT-based services within a manufacturing context. This work aims to develop a technological framework to improve the efficiency of the XR application development and the usability of the XR-based HMI systems. We first introduce four layers of the framework, including the perception layer with the physical machine and its ROS-based simulation model, the machine communication layer, the network layer containing three kinds of communication middleware, and the Unity-based service layer creating XR-based digital applications. Subsequently, we conduct the responsiveness test for the framework and describe several XR industrial applications for a DT-based smart crane. Finally, we highlight the research challenges and potential issues that should be further addressed by analyzing the performance of the whole framework. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: With the introduction of Society 5.0 for the sustainable future, special caution is given to humans’ role within the general system. Similarly, Industry 5.0 as a concept has been presented, followed by Logistics 5.0 in its theoretical framework. The transition towards the new concept of Logistics 5.0 requires an accurate and optimal strategic plan definition for which, in this paper, an implementation model based on decision support systems will be developed. The output data from this model are the priority of Logistics 5.0 elements (from five groups—green warehousing, green transport, green packaging, infrastructure and organization, and human resources) for the optimal implementation, based on three goals (initial investment, return of investment time, implementation and exploitation complexity) that companies aim to achieve in the future. The model is based on the analytic hierarchy process, and data were collected from an expert group and analyzed with several statistical methods. The result is a model that provides an optimal strategy for the implementation of elements of Logistics 5.0. The implementation priority list of elements is very beneficial for the management of many companies from various types of industries. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: The construction industry’s inherent fragmentation fuels Construction Supply Chain (CSC) complexity. Logistics form an essential part of the CSC in terms of costs and project management. In turn, transportation accounts for more than half the logistics costs due to construction materials being low-cost/high-volume, and most other logistics processes being business processes and not physical ones. Construction transport is almost entirely road bound, one of the least sustainable modes with externalities far out of proportion to its numbers. Ergo, its optimisation presents substantial greening (de-carbonisation) opportunity, with potentially far-reaching sustainability impacts. The ASI (Avoid-Shift-Improve) concept considers activity, modal structure, and energy intensity/efficiency as transport carbon components, providing a fundamental optimisation framework. 93% of New Zealand’s freight (a third of it construction related) is road bound, with 99% fossil-fuel (diesel) dependence. Government adoption of ASI elements viz Supply Chain (SC) efficiency, transport optimisation, data/information sharing, and collaboration for transport decarbonisation aligns with Industry 5.0, but seeks further research for concrete implementation pathways. This paper aims to bridge the gap by proposing a research framework for greening of construction transport as a sustainability enabler for New Zealand.

ABSTRACT: Manufacturing environments that rely on empowered shopfloor workers with decentralized decision making, as proposed in the Industry 5.0 vision, call for adapted approaches to production management. Aside from personal competencies, efficient decision making in VUCA environments primarily requires high-quality, up-to-date information. Based on popular value stream mapping methods, this paper proposes an approach to systematically analyze the shopfloor decision making in terms of information efficiency. The modified value stream mapping approach (MVSM) offers support for discovering informational bottlenecks in manufacturing processes, which subsequently can be addressed with targeted optimization measures. Qualitative results from the first practical implementations indicate the capabilities, limitations and improvement potentials of the proposed approach. © 2022 Owner/Author.

ABSTRACT: The last 20 years have brought significant developments to digital fabrication technology, known as additive manufacturing (3D printing), and it has finally started to shed its prototyping mantel in favor of an industrial one. Yet its innovations are in danger of being subsumed into existing commercial practices, as society arguably continues to underestimate its ability, in conjunction with data collection, analysis, and communication tools, to disrupt current systems and enable a more equitable distribution of manufacturing wealth, capability, and capacity. This chapter highlights the potential of emerging industrial technologies to support a shift towards a more human-centered, responsible society where social and environmental problems are addressed through systems that maximises cyberspace and physical space integration, through the reframing of higher education engineering curriculum and pedagogy for manufacturing in Society 5.0. © 2022, IGI Global.

ABSTRACT: Sustainable technologies, including clean energy in manufacturing and green and reverse logistics, generate conditions for industry development and future growth with the implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies and innovations in the context of sustainable development goals (SDGs). The objective of the article is to identify and analyse the potential of sustainable technologies in syn-ergy with Industry 4.0 innovations and renewable energy initiatives in manufacturing and logistics in the context of SDGs. Qualitative analysis was performed on 105 enterprises of various business sizes, in several regions of Slovakia, within various industry sectors, and within geographical coverage. Based on the summarised results, we can state that more than 82% of surveyed enterprises implement the SDGs. Currently, more than 70% of enterprises prefer environmental aspects in business manage-ment. Based on the results, we find a significant relationship between the environmental management of the enterprise in the context of SDGs and sustainability in production and logistics. Statistical analysis confirmed the relationship between the use of renewable energy technology in the industrial sector. A significant relationship was also demonstrated between sustainability in logistics activities in the industrial sector in waste separation and recycling; environmental certification; environmental training of employees; the use of renewable energy sources and the continuous reduction of CO2 in all logistics activities. The results of the study indicate a significant relationship between green manufacturing, green logistics, reverse logistics and selected Industry 4.0 technologies: autonomous robots, renewable energy, advanced materials, virtual technologies, and simulation. We conclude the significant influence of environmental management on business production and logistics. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Recently, the concept of Industry 5.0 has been introduced to complement, among other things, Industry 4.0's focus on efficiency and productivity with a focus on humans in digital design and production processes. The inclusion of human interaction with digital realities, extended reality (XR) technologies, such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), can play an essential role in Industry 5.0. While rapid advances in XR technologies are solidifying and finding their place in the product and production development process, terminology and classification scheme remain under-determined. As a result, there have been numerous classifications of XR technologies from different perspectives, but little widespread agreement. They have been classified by their level of immersion or how well they meet a specific purpose (such as training). In addition to that, the classifications are usually made for one particular field (e.g. marketing, healthcare, engineering, architecture, among others). Therefore, to set the basis for future research, it is essential to identify and outline the dimensions that intervene in product and production design in regards to XR facilitated collaboration. With the ideas proposed in this paper, we want to identify basic concepts that classify a collaborative XR system by analyzing how users interact with the environment and other users. Our motivation is that collaborative design involves not only the physical dimension but also a social dimension. Defining when an XR system contributes to increasing social and/or physical presence could clarify and simplify its categorization. © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.

ABSTRACT: Globalization and mass customization are commonly translated into increased levels of complexity in manufacturing systems. One of the main reasons is the increased number of variables, parameters, and interrelations on the shop floor. This intrinsic complexity can grow exponentially when considering the manufacture of large-size products with high levels of variability and variants: the mass production of large recreational motorboats with high levels of customization and low production volumes, mass customization. With the increasing role of sustainability and concepts of Industry 5.0, focusing not just on improving production systems but also human wellbeing, quick decision making becomes essential. Data and digitalization are becoming the cornerstone for system improvement, and digital data availability and analysis can facilitate the utilization of computerized tools to support decision making and maximize the performance of complex systems. For that purpose, simulation can be a powerful analytical tool to design, maintain, and improve complex manufacturing systems. Simulation techniques usually allow handling the size and complexity commonly associated with manufacturing systems. However, in systems with highly customized and large-size products, manual processes, and limited floor space, the implementation of simulation techniques is not straightforward, especially considering the aspects of variability, data collection, model validation, and system reconfiguration. With a particular focus on large-size products and limitations of a constrained existing facility layout, this paper presents the implementation of a simulation-based reconfiguration assessment considering manual production, assembly, and internal logistics requirements. Going through an industrial case study of large recreational motorboats manufacturing, the paper analyses the system analysis, data collection, implementation, and validation of the methodology step by step. Considering different what-if scenarios, the focus is on the capacity reconfiguration using Discrete-Event Simulation. The results can serve as a guideline for decision-makers and stakeholders working with complex mass customization manufacturing systems and space-constrained facility layouts. © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.

ABSTRACT: Needs for new competences and knowledge arise as industry 4.0 evolves in increasingly digitalized production. This development entails that job transformations and future skills need attention from the perspective of industry 5.0, where human and machine find ways of working together to improve production performance. Facing this perspective, one challenge is a growing need for novel lifelong learning initiatives, to meet emerging and altering occupations for the fulfilment of future skill requirements. This challenge is addressed here by portraying a case where three Swedish universities have formed a distinctive collaboration to develop a flexible (i.e. blended) course for professionals, in the subject of Digitally-enabled production. The purpose is to develop a sustainable collaboration between the universities and create a course format on master level addressing lifelong learning for the increasingly digitalized production. The ambition is to increase the impact of the universities respective efforts by sharing resources and utilizing individual specialized expertise to develop a practical and relevant course that can reach a larger target group. The course encompasses industry 4.0 readiness on three levels of production systems; plant-, production cell-, and component level; to adopt a holistic view of digitalization in production. We followed an action research approach for continuously collecting and documenting our experiences during the course development, implementation, and dissemination of the course. Within the frame of action research, an explorative case study describes and analyzes the initiative. The results highlight challenges and opportunities for succeeding with this form of co-produced course. The joint course gives professionals possibilities to work on cases from their own companies with expert supervision from three manufacturing levels to address complex challenges in industry 4.0 implementation. To conclude, the importance of lifelong learning in relation to the human-centric approach of industry 5.0 is emphasized as a future direction. © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.

ABSTRACT: Industry 5.0 constitutes a change of paradigm where the increase of economic benefits caused by a never-ending increment of production is no longer the only priority. Instead, Industry 5.0 addresses social and planetary challenges caused or neglected in Industry 4.0 and below. One relevant the most relevant challenges of Industry 5.0 is the design of human-centered smart environments (i.e., that prioritize human well-being while maintaining production performance). In these environments, robots and humans will share the same space and collaborate to reach common objectives. This article presents a literature review of the different aspects concerning the problem of quality measurement in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) applications for manufacturing environments. To help practitioners and new researchers in the area, this article presents an overview of factors, metrics, and measures used in the robotics community to evaluate performance and human well-being quality aspects in HRI applications. For this, we performed a systematic search in relevant databases for robotics (Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, ACM digital library, and Springer Link). We summarize and classify results extracted from 102 peer-reviewed research articles published until March 2022 in two definition models: 1) a taxonomy of performance aspects and 2) a Venn Diagram of common human factors in HRI. Additionally, we briefly explain the differences between often confusing or overlapped concepts in the area. We also introduce common human factors evaluated by the robotics community and identify seven emergent research topics which can have a relevant impact on Industry 5.0. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers

ABSTRACT: Industry 5.0 is regarded as the next industrial evolution which is still on its infancy stage and under investigation phenomena. How shared economy can perform a superlative role in augmenting the corporate sustainable performance is another interesting gap that needs to be unveiled. This study investigates the linkage between shared economy practices and corporate triple bottom line (TBL) in three core streams—environmental performance (ENVP), social performance (SP), and economic performance (EP)—using empirical data. An additional factor of industry 5.0 (i5.0) technologies was treated as a moderator between shared economy and TBL. The findings assured the positive nexus of shared economy (i.e., contract manufacturing services, professional services, data entry & clerical services, creative and multimedia services, sales and marketing services, software development services, and writing or translation services) on TBL (i.e., ENVP, SP, and EP). The positive moderating influence of i5.0 technologies was further affirmed between the relationships of shared economy and TBL. The findings yield multidimensional insights for operational management to adopt shared economy and i5.0 practices to improve corporate TBL in today’s competitive era. In addition, this study accentuates the notion of shared economy by providing positive evidence from developing nations. The study also highlights insightful implications for managers along with future avenues for the researchers to conduct additional multi-directional studies worldwide. © The Author(s) 2022.

ABSTRACT: Fourth industrial revolution is the introduction of ICT (mostly IoT) in industry and else-where, which enables the creation of cyber-physical systems, i.e., digital twins of reality. The application of widespread digitization of processes brings changes in terms of increased efficiency of processes, increased flexibility of production, and the possibility of realizing prosocial and pro-ecological goals, such as sustainable development, sustainable production and consumption, and reducing the consumption of increasingly expensive energy. Nowadays, the high autonomy of cyber-physical systems and benefits to society are expected by including human factors within the Industry 5.0 concept. Implementing the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies and meeting the expectations of sustainable development also means new challenges for the knowledge and skills of industry employees, mainly engineers implementing modern solutions. Hence, the article’s aim is to identify the critical knowledge and skills of engineers responsible for implementing the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies. The achievements and results presented in the article were obtained based on research conducted among experts from the University of Pennsylvania (USA). The study considers aspects connected to the problems of implementing the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies and identifies the benefits and risks of their implementation for Society 5.0. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: With the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, vaccination is an urgent need worldwide. Internet of Things (IoT) has a vital role in the smart city for vaccine manufacturing with wearable sensors. According to the advanced services in intelligent manufacturing, the fourth resolution is also changing in Industry 5.0 and utilizes high-definition connectivity sensors. Traditional manufacturing companies rely on trusted third parties, which may act as a single point of failure. Access control, big data, and scalability are also challenging issues in existing systems because of the demand response data (DRD) in advanced manufacturing. To mitigate these challenges, CoVAC: A P2P Smart Contract-based Intelligent Smart City Architecture for Vaccine Manufacturing is proposed with three layers, including connection, conversion, and intelligent cloud layer. Smart contract-based blockchain is utilized at the conversion layer for resolving access control, security, and privacy issues. Deep learning is adopted in the intelligent cloud layer for big data analysis and increasing production for vaccine manufacturing in smart city environments. A case study is carried out wherein access data are collected from the various smart plants for vaccines using smart manufacturing to validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. Simulation of the proposed architecture is performed on the collected advanced sensor IoT plants data to address the challenges above, offering scalable production in the vaccine manufacturing for the smart city. © 2022

ABSTRACT: Smart machine companions such as artificial intelligence (AI) assistants and collaborative robots are rapidly populating the factory floor. Future factory floor workers will work in teams that include both human co-workers and smart machine actors. The visions of Industry 5.0 describe sustainable, resilient, and human-centered future factories that will require smart and resilient capabilities both from next-generation manufacturing systems and human operators. What kinds of approaches can help design these kinds of resilient human–machine teams and collaborations within them? In this paper, we analyze this design challenge, and we propose basing the design on the joint cognitive systems approach. The established joint cognitive systems approach can be complemented with approaches that support human centricity in the early phases of design, as well as in the development of continuously co-evolving human–machine teams. We propose approaches to observing and analyzing the collaboration in human–machine teams, developing the concept of operations with relevant stakeholders, and including ethical aspects in the design and development. We base our work on the joint cognitive systems approach and propose complementary approaches and methods, namely: actor–network theory, the concept of operations and ethically aware design. We identify their possibilities and challenges in designing and developing smooth human–machine teams for Industry 5.0 manufacturing systems. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Digital transformation and automation in the shipping industry is resulting disruptive changes to ship design, operations, and manning that aim to enhance safety, efficiency, and the environmental sustainability of maritime logistics. While there is growing research interest in these areas, examining the role of human element in the new smart shipping context is largely neglected. Through a systematic literature review, this paper aims to explore the multi-dimensional impact of autonomous shipping technology resulting from the application of Industry 4.0 and future industrial revolutions on seafarers. The impacts include the changing role of seafarers on-board and the strategies required to engage seafarers in their transition from traditional shipping to autonomous and smart shipping. The paper concludes that Industry 4.0 is being challenged for its shortfall in recognition of the importance of human role and its intelligence in the expected current industrial revolution. As a result, there is a demand to look further and beyond Industry 4.0 by introducing the next generation of industrial revolution, namely Industry 5.0. This paper suggests that the impact of this revolution in the maritime industry can be defined by concepts such as Maritime 5.0, Shipping 5.0, Seafarer 5.0, Maritime Education and Training 5.0 (MET 5.0). © 2021 The Authors

ABSTRACT: This study contributes to identifying a valid and reliable set of barriers to sustainable solid waste management framework rooted in society 5.0 perspectives in Taiwan. The SSWM-related causal interrelationships within the proposed hierarchical structure, and critical barriers for the practical improvement and enhancement of SSWM performance are identified as preference enriching both literature and practices. In nature, the hierarchical structure is with the causal interrelationships under uncertainties. The perspective empowers the creation of a new biosphere based on technological progress, but in the sustainable solid waste management field, it is difficult to encounter and shape the systematized processes due to barriers and challenges. To address this shortcoming, this study evaluates the technical challenges faced in the field of sustainable solid waste management toward society 5.0. The valid attributes are usually described the qualitative information. The fuzzy Delphi method is applied to acquire the valid and reliable attributes. Fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory experiment is to visualize the causal interrelationships among the attributes. Choquet integral with respect to the nonadditive attributes over the valid set provides an overall perspective function. The results establish an understanding of sustainable solid waste management barriers in the perspectives under uncertainties. Community uncertainty, policy and regulation problems, city architecture, and technology interaction are the factors that influence sustainable performance. In practices, (1) diverse disciplines and sectors in local, national, and global communities; (2) a lack of mobility and reliability; (3) mass production and mass consumption; (4) an insufficient level of artificial intelligence application; and (5) failures related to data management and security hinder the improvement of sustainable solid waste management toward society 5.0. The social and technical perspectives are indicated as the top priorities to improve SSWM performance. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Technology is composed of the words “Techne” and “Logos” that refer to the artistic/creative and the logical/scientific aspects of its dualism. And so inherent this Promethean concept lie the concepts of the Schumpeterian creative destruction and also the promise and potential for humanity’s better tomorrows. We live in an era of artificial intelligence–driven as well as viral disruptions that challenge the mind as well as the body. At the same time, the impact of our pursuit of prosperity at any cost on the environment triggers displaced people floods and viral pandemics undermining the standard of living and more importantly the foundations of trust in institutions and in a better tomorrow feeding populist movements and autocratic trends in democracies as well as emboldening dictators. This work discusses the concepts of Risk Management 5.0, Industry 4.0, Industry 5.0, Society 5.0, Digital Transformation, Blockchain, and the role of AI via the Internet of Things architectures that could enable “smarter as well as more humane solutions to our challenges”. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The term Industry 4.0, coined to be the fourth industrial revolution, refers to a higher level of automation for operational productivity and efficiency by connecting virtual and physical worlds in an industry. With Industry 4.0 being unable to address and meet increased drive of personalization, the term Industry 5.0 was coined for addressing personalized manufacturing and empowering humans in manufacturing processes. The onset of the term Industry 5.0 is observed to have various views of how it is defined and what constitutes the reconciliation between humans and machines. This serves as the motivation of this paper in identifying and analyzing the various themes and research trends of what Industry 5.0 is using text mining tools and techniques. Toward this, the abstracts of 196 published papers based on the keyword “Industry 5.0” search in IEEE, science direct and MDPI data bases were extracted. Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed for further analysis to apply text mining techniques of key terms extraction and frequency analysis. Further topic mining i.e., unsupervised machine learning method was used for exploring the data. It is observed that the terms artificial intelligence (AI), big data, supply chain, digital transformation, machine learning, internet of things (IoT), are among the most often used and among several enablers that have been identified by researchers to drive Industry 5.0. Five major themes of Industry 5.0 addressing, supply chain evaluation and optimization, enterprise innovation and digitization, smart and sustainable manufacturing, transformation driven by IoT, AI, and Big Data, and Human-machine connectivity were classified among the published literature, highlighting the research themes that can be further explored. It is observed that the theme of Industry 5.0 as a gateway towards human machine connectivity and co-existence is gaining more interest among the research community in the recent years. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Physical Internet (PI) is an open global logistics system of which components are hyperconnected for increased efficiency and sustainability. Digital twin (DT), referring to the virtual representation of a physical object, is well-perceived as a key driver in the development of PI-based Supply Chain Management (SCM). Due to the capabilities of real-time monitoring and evaluation of large-scale complex systems, significant research efforts have been made to exploit values of PI/DT in SCM. Despite this, the current literature remained largely unstructured and scattered due to a lack of systematic literature reviews to synergise research findings, analyse the evolution of research fronts and extract emerging trends in the field. To address this issue, the paper deploys a bibliometric knowledge mapping approach to provide a bird's eye view of the current research status in the PI/DT-SCM area. Using CiteSpace's keyword co-occurrence network, 518 journal articles are clustered into 10 key research streams on PI/DT applications in: job shop scheduling, smart manufacturing design, PI-based SCM, manufacturing virtualisation, information management, sustainability development, data analytics, manufacturing operations management, simulation and optimisation, and assembly process planning. Based on citation burst rate, keywords representing research frontiers of the PI/DT are detected and their temporal evolutions are discussed. Likewise, some identified emerging research trends are production process and system, robotics, computer architecture, and cost. Finally, seven future research directions are suggested, which emphasise on several PI/DT-related issues, including business ecosystem, sustainability development, SC downstream management, cognitive thinking in Industry 5.0, citizen twin in digital society, and SC resilience. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The efficient exploitation of the cloud continuum (interworking of industrial cloud, edge cloud, 5G/B5G base stations, and fog node technologies) is a key factor for future Industry4.0 and beyond applications. For instance, with their ability to work more locally to data sources and to controllable actuators, cloud continuum-based solutions are considered very promising for dynamic manufacturing line control/reconfiguration and for sustainability optimizations (reduction of power and materials consumption). In these contexts, privacy, data sovereignty/control, latency, reliability, and scalability are crucial. This short paper, summarizing some key concepts from the associated keynote speech, aims at offering an overview of the concept of Digital Twins (DTs) for Industry5.0 [1] and at showing some primary and state-of-the-art solution guidelines that are emerging in the field. In particular, in our H2020 IoTwins project [2], we promote, design, implement, and evaluate Industry5.0 DTs that are both distributed because they are able to run over differentiated cloud continuum virtualized resources, also by changing their location dynamically, and hybrid because they combine data-driven machine learning models and simulations based on mathematical-physical modeling of the cyber-physical systems they represent. Distributed and hybrid DTs based on cloud continuum technologies are showing their effectiveness and efficiency in different application cases and scenarios, as demonstrated by our experience of IoTwins testbeds development. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: There is a gap between the “radical” visions for Industry 5.0 and the practical solutions, which are mainly based on enabling technologies, we have seen so far. We still need more practical guidelines and cases to get an understanding of how, or whether Industry 5.0 could be relevant as an approach for manufacturing companies to meet the challenges they are facing. This paper investigates how Industry 5.0 can be the reference for developing capabilities needed for meeting the increasingly challenging market and sustainability requirements. To be able to capture all facets and effects of Industry 5.0, the sustainability, resilience and human centricity principles have to work jointly together aligned with roadmaps. This paper presents a platform for industry 5.0 capability development based upon literature that is tested in two firms in the agricultural industry. “The Core Product Service Platform” describing the products and services to deliver and capabilities needed to become an Industry 5.0 company. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

ABSTRACT: Recent technological advances encompassed by the smart factory concept have fundamentally changed industrial control systems in the way they are structured and how they operate. Majority of these changes affect Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, shifting them to a higher level of interoperability, heterogeneous networks, big data and toward internet technologies and services in general. However, this transformation does not affect all SCADA systems equally. The immediate industrial environment and controlled processes have a significant impact as well. This paper presents a holistic approach to SCADA systems implemented in continuous flow production control within the steel industry production environment. We outline the multi-layer architecture of the SCADA control framework and the aspects of interoperability and interconnectivity within the architecture reference models, together with the research challenges and opportunities arising from the recent rapid increasement of the industrial control systems complexity and digital transformation under the Industry 4.0 paradigm, resulting in disrupting levels of the traditional automation pyramid based on Purdue model toward a higher level of integration and interoperability enabling cross-level data exchange empowered by the Industrial Internet of Things. Furthermore, the paper addresses the problem of proprietary SCADA systems and elaborates the causal correlation between SCADA quality requirements and adoption of new technologies in relation to the specific industrial environment of the steel manufacturing process. © 2013 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Recent trends towards Industry 5.0 focus on a sustainable and resilient industry, aiming to make technology and innovation more focused on humans and today’s societal concerns. Consequently, this trend also leads to more sustainable and resilient manufacturing, for which collaborative networks play a main role due to the needed involvement of multiple players, being important to consider a perspective of co-responsibility. Establishing adequate performance indicators to assess how collaborative manufacturing ecosystems can support sustainability is thus relevant. Furthermore, this work also analyses how such performance indicators can be used as an influencing factor contributing to improving the players’ behaviour, representing the idea of co-responsibility for a more sustainable manufacturing network. This article proposes a set of performance indicators and a related simulation model to set up several scenarios to analyse how collaboration can influence sustainability in horizontal manufacturing networks. Results from simulation scenarios are included and discussed. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

ABSTRACT: Industry 5.0 complements the Industry 4.0 paradigm by highlighting research and innovation as drivers for a transition to a sustainable, human-centric and resilient industry. In this context, new types of interactions between operators and machines are facilitated, that can be realized through artificial intelligence (AI) based and voice-enabled Digital Intelligent Assistants (DIA). Apart from the existing technological challenges, this direction requires new methodologies for the evaluation of such technological solutions that will be able to treat AI in manufacturing as a socio-technical system. In this paper, we propose a framework for the evaluation of voice-enabled AI solutions in Industry 5.0, which consists of four dimensions: the trustworthiness of the AI system; the usability of the DIA; the cognitive workload of individual users; and the overall business benefits for the corporation. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

ABSTRACT: New synergies between human and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are key aspects for generating collaborators instead of competitors, strengthening the human role of Industry 5.0. Bidirectional Communication Channels (BCCs) between humans and machines lay the foundation of these synergies within manufacturing environments. This position paper reviews main currently available visualization and interaction technologies to connect data, humans, CPS, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machines, presenting a selection of use cases and applications for AI services. The successful design, development and integration of these bidirectional communication channels poses relevant open research challenges for the future to revolutionize current manufacturing environments. © 2022 CEUR-WS.

ABSTRACT: Despite the fact that Industry 4.0 concepts and technologies are still being developed and still being adopted, the lessons learned from the last decade have helped shape up the notion of Industry 5.0 - as the next ‘revolution’ in industrial domain. Even though Industry 5.0 shared many concepts with Industry 4.0, it is characterized by three main elements, human-centricity, sustainability and resilience. In this paper, we introduce a digital manufacturing platform architecture that extends Industry 4.0 paradigms to enable AI-based decision support with the necessary trustworthiness and human-centricity elements primed for Industry 5.0. The proposed architecture helps realize the balancing act of getting the perceived benefits from AI-centric digitalization while preserving the role of humans in key decision-making activities. © 2022 CEUR-WS.

ABSTRACT: Industry 5.0 is a combination of organisational principles and technologies to design and manage operations and supply chains as resilient, sustainable, and human-centric systems. While the general notion of Industry 5.0 has been elaborated, its implications for future operations and supply chains remain underexplored. This paper contributes to the conceptualisation of Industry 5.0 from the perspective of viability. We contextualise a framework of Industry 5.0 through the lens of the viable supply chain model, the reconfigurable supply chain, and human-centric ecosystems. Our study uncovers the major dimensions that characterise Industry 5.0 as a technological-organisational framework. First, the major technological principles of Industry 5.0 are collaboration, coordination, communication, automation, data analytics processing, and identification. Second, Industry 5.0 covers four areas: organisation, management, technology, and performance assessment. Third, Industry 5.0 spans three levels: society level, network level, and plant level. Last but not least, Industry 5.0 frames a new triple bottom line: resilient value creation, human well-being, and sustainable society. We provide a definition of Industry 5.0 and discuss its implications by elaborating on the understanding of value in Industry 5.0, which spans the dimensions of profit, people, and society. We also discuss open research areas. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Global industrialisation creates many challenges in achieving the balance of sustainability pillars called social, economic and environmental. Manufacturing is the largest subsector of industrialisation. Hence the sustainability of manufacturing greatly affects the sustainability of industrialization. Thus, the research community and industry professionals give attention to the Sustainable Manufacturing (SM) concept. Further, they have realized the significance of technology when focusing on SM. Accordingly, they have aligned the path of achieving SM with the recent manufacturing technology called “Industry 4.0” (I4.0) for more innovative and efficient outcomes. The developed countries and some of the developing countries drive towards the I4.0 concept to achieve SM. However, in terms of the Sri Lankan context, there is no clear evidence to demonstrate the integration of the I4.0 and SM. But there are few studies based on implementing I4.0 for apparel manufacturing in Sri Lanka. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the present status of the application of the I4.0 concept towards achieving SM in apparel manufacturing in Sri Lanka by selecting three large scale apparel manufacturing case studies. This was tested using a model which links the I4.0 pillars and the key opportunities for three dimensions of SM from nine technology pillars observed through previous studies. The findings from the case studies proved that there is a huge gap in the application of I4.0 for SM in the Sri Lankan context. © 2022, Ceylon Institute of Builders. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Smart technologies are not only drivers of economic and societal disruptive changes – they are a chance to shape our future in a beneficial way as enablers of a sustainable, “green” world. They are a means to support the implementation of the 17 UN SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) and the European “Green Deal”. The current crisis (climate change, Ukraine war, just to mention a few causes) has shown that our society and economy are not resilient against such critical changes. One of the approaches is to invest much more in circular economy and sustainable modes of production, transport and living, to reduce dangerous dependencies in all industrial and social areas. On the one hand, a severe economic crisis with shortage of essential resources for people worldwide bears risks of social instability and war, on the other hand, mitigation by smart technologies and high automation including autonomous systems bears a considerable risk to democracy, human rights and self-determination as well. European policy has reacted to the challenges of climate change and environmental footprint reduction particularly in context of production, transport, farming and large urban agglomerations – smartness (intelligence) is not only addressing well-being, assisted living and comfort of citizens (keyword “Society 5.0”), but even more sustainability goals in the long term (“Green and Circular Cities”). © 2022 IDIMT.

ABSTRACT: Green innovation is an important way for enterprises to achieve high-quality economic development, and it is also the way to achieve the goal of double carbon. Green innovation has therefore become a research hotspot. With the acceleration of the digitalization process in equipment enterprises, intelligent manufacturing equipment enterprises located at the top of the industrial chain are in urgent need of green core technology innovation activities. In order to explore the internal mechanism of core green technology innovation, this research introduces reputation theory into the evolutionary game analysis process. By constructing an evolutionary game model between the government and intelligent manufacturing equipment enterprises, this research analyzes the dynamic factors that affect the selection and evolution of the main strategies of the players in the evaluation game. The results show that corporate reputation, core green technology innovation profit, government subsidies, government reputation, and the cost for the government to support core technology, among other factors, importantly affect the game between the government and the enterprises. At the same time, since both the government and the enterprises are affected by the initial state and the maximization of the interests of both sides of the game, it is difficult for them to spontaneously reach an ideal stable and balanced state through a virtuous circle. The greater the profits and the reputation premium the core green technology innovation brings to the enterprises, the more favorable it is for the enterprises to choose core green technology innovation; government subsidies within a certain range will also drive enterprises to choose core green technology innovation. When the value of enterprise core green technology innovation is low, the cost for the government to support core green technology innovation is lower, enterprises will lose more opportunities and decline in global competitiveness, and it will become more favorable for the government to evolve towards supporting core green technology innovation. On the contrary, the government will gradually transfer its tangible hand to the intangible hand of the market based on the consideration of subsidies, innovation costs, and reputation. The results of this research are intended to provide a theoretical basis and practical reference for Chinese intelligent manufacturing equipment enterprises to better achieve green core technology innovation. © 2022 Baohong Li and Peng Song.

ABSTRACT: Algae have the potential to overcome many environmental problems and meet the demand for bio-based products. Researchers have found that microalgae are suitable to be used for liquid fuel, food, fertilizers, natural-based pigments, pharmaceutical products, and many more. However, algae are always seen to link with eutrophication as excessive nutrients from fertilizers enter waterbodies that lead to the growth of cyanobacteria and blue-green algae. Increasing anthropogenic activities, as well as external factors such as sunlight and water runoff drive these macroscale ecological disorders. This chapter focuses on the relationship of algal bloom and eutrophication with a particular focus on the application and implication of algae. Agricultural cultivation of algae is one of the promising solutions to improve the production and efficiency of bio-based products, reduction of greenhouse gases, extraction of constituents that are used as diagnostic and medicine tools. This chapter also discusses steps to identify and harvest algae from the algal bloom sites. The revolutionized industry brings new technological tools to help scientists to identify particular genes on cyanobacteria chromosomes. Many tests and research comparative studies are required to identify algae genes consisting of valuable biomolecules as alternative sustainable bioproducts and innovative biological processes and principles to sustainably provide goods and services to achieve circular bioeconomy associated with industrial revolution 5.0. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Industrial civilization transforms current cutting edge technologies and the evolution of Industry 5.0 is more aggressive with the use of IoT-enabled smart machines and robots in the manufacturing sector today. IoT technology deals with digital data as in additive manufacturing (AM). The potential and progressive aspects of AM embarks for functional part development instead of initial prototyping. AM is one of large-scale production with less buy-to-fly (BTF) ratio. In the present work, a novel framework has been proposed and utilized to attain adaptive bead modeling and an appropriate path plan for enhanced deposition and surface quality of weld beads. Further, the influence of input process parameters toward sustainable wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is also focused. Machine learning-based hybrid-TLBO (h-TLBO) and support vector machine (SVM) is deployed for the optimization process. With the aid of graph theory, weights are estimated for h-TLBO. The overall process parameters and entire data module is handled with IoT technology and can be accessed for processing. The simulated post-processing results are validated experimental test results and found to be in good concurrence. © IMechE 2022.

ABSTRACT: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) that combine IoT (Internet of Things) and Cloud computation technologies are an emerging trend in Industry 5.0. Such systems could lead to a different manufacturing process closer to the current market needs. In addition, the factories can be more efficient, sustainable, and environmentally friendly. This work intends to explore a different approach to the manufacturing process, where there is no production planned behind and the shop floor is a provider of services for the products to be built. For that purpose, this paper proposes an executable model defining the interaction between the different actors and representing the digital counterpart of the CPS. We use a high-level graphical language to create the executable model that allows easy and flexible experimentation with different scenarios. Also, the model can be made as detailed as needed while providing a precise and readable simulation and a resulting detailed log amenable to further analysis. © 2022 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Today's Industry 4.0 (I4) is re-designing industrial activities and re-shaping communities into the so-called Society 5.0 (S5), enabling the creation of a new industry-societyenvironment nexus. The application of novel technologies such as pervasive sensing, widespread internet of the things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and robotics aims to sense, calculate, and actuate by employing data-driven architectures and automated decisions for reaching more efficient processes that reduce environmental impacts and transform manpower workloads. This work introduces a cyber-physical system (CPS) towards more innovative operations within the mining industry's mine-to-mill process, whereby the operations’ decision-making and executions are often done by human intelligence. However, the increasing use of autonomous machines or mechatronics (MEC) such as trucks, drills, drones, and conveyor belts, combined with advanced modelling and solving algorithms (MSA), can achieve the necessary autonomous operations for handling such hazards and harsh environments, where no or reduced manpower is required. For that, information and computing technologies (ICT) facilitate innovative solutions to re-shape and re-design production systems. The interplaying of advanced technologies of the I4 mandate and circular economy (CE) ideology towards the mines of the future creates a smart connected mining industry that embeds vast amounts of data into predictive and fully integrated intelligent systems. This paper discusses how I4’s technological developments in mining sector applications generate opportunities to re-design and re-execute stockpiling to conveyor-belt processes into enhanced production states from a CE perspective (environmental, economic, and social). CE theories within I4-S5 offer innovative sustainable industrial concepts driven by safer, more environmentally friendly towards precision and autonomous mining. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: This article provides a review about how uncertainties in increasingly complex production and supply chains should be addressed in scheduling tasks. Uncertainty management will be particularly important in Industry 5.0 solutions that will require the close integration of operators and technical systems. To prepare for these challenging developments, this work reviews the sources of uncertainty and the scheduling algorithms that deal with the different types of models developed to handle the uncertain nature of the elements and the environment of complex technological systems. The paper not only identifies the challenges, but also the main building blocks that can help to manage and reduce uncertainties based on the I4.0 and I5.0 solutions. We hope that this study will serve as a starting point for R&D projects and algorithm developments, which will be needed primarily in the field of multi-agent, multistage and inverse optimizations. © 2013 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Optimizing semiconductor manufacturing processes is needed to solve the current shortage of computer chips. Discarding unfinished chips based on data-driven predictions models can significantly reduce time and resources otherwise spent on finishing faulty chips. The current paper presents the value proposition of predictive discarding at different stages in the manufacturing process, by combining model performance metrics with costs and benefits related to false and correct discards. While applied to the chip manufacturing process in this paper, predictive discarding is a generic methodology to minimize wasted resources by predicting product quality from process data. Through sensitivity analysis, we show that even with weak predictors, predictive discarding can still be beneficial, from both economic and sustainability perspectives. The proposed method is illustrated by analysing an empirical benchmark data set from the semiconductor manufacturing domain. © 2022 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In the past, manufacturing equipment was instrumented hard-wired. Industrial equipment such as sensors, controllers, and others are expensive, and upgrading manufacturing equipment in existing facilities is costly. The growing use of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven cost reductions in sensors, controllers, and communications through high volumes of digital devices and value-added components. The manufacturing sector with its massive installed base of legacy equipment has also become an area of interest for the advances in innovative digital technologies. Meanwhile, the next level of innovation in manufacturing has been achieved, labeled by the term 4th Industrial Revolution, in short Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 takes the automation of manufacturing processes to a new level by introducing customized and intelligent production technologies. Machines are connected and communicate with each other to ultimately make decisions, operate independently, or cooperate with humans in a customer-oriented production environment. This raises the question about the key issues of the next industrial enhancement and the term to call it? The change from Industry 4.0 to the next innovative industrial enhancement is termed Industry 5.0. However, Industry 5.0 has its root in the concept of Industry 4.0. Thus, the key issues of the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 can be seen in the goal of making manufacturability sustainable from economic, ecologic and societal perspectives. This requires building a circular economy with a focus on a human centric industry. The paper describes the development from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0. © 2022 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Industry 5.0 envisions close cooperation between humans and machines requiring ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC). The Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) has the potential to play a crucial role in realizing wireless URLLC for Industry 5.0. IRS is forecast to be a key enabler of 6G wireless communication networks as it can significantly improve wireless network performance by creating a controllable radio environment. In this paper, we first provide an overview of IRS technology and then conceptualize the potential for IRS implementation in a future smart manufacturing environment to support the emergence of Industry 5.0 with a series of applications. Finally, to stimulate future research in this area, we discuss the strength, open challenges, and opportunities of IRS technology in modern smart manufacturing. IEEE

ABSTRACT: Fish constitute important high protein products to meet the demands of an increasing global population. However, the continued depletion of wild fish stocks is leading to increased strain on the aquaculture sector in terms of sustaining the supply of fish and seafood to global markets. Despite the fact that aquaculture is more diversified than other agriculture sectors, there are significant pressures on the industry to continue innovating in order to enable sustainability including increased fish production, improved appropriate selection of species, disease mitigation, reduced wastage, preventing environmental pollution and generating more employment globally. This viewpoint article addresses how digital transformation can help support and meet expansion needs of the fisheries/aquaculture industries that includes exploiting and harnessing ICT, IoT, Cloud-edge computing, AI, machine learning, immersive technologies and blockchain. Digital technologies are bringing significant operational benefits for global food chain, improving efficiencies and productivity, reducing waste, contamination and food fraud. The focus on digital technologies has recently evolved to Industry 5.0 where AI and robotics are coupled with the human mind in order to advance human-centric solutions. This viewpoint describes the role of Quadruple helix Hub (academic-industry-government and society) in delivering a convergent holistic approach to meeting the diversity of fishery industry needs by connecting and placing fisheries centrally in a defined ecosystem of stakeholders. This includes specialist training, testing technologies, providing access to finance and fostering disruption through aquaculture accelerator initiatives such as that provided by Hatch Blue. Connecting digital Innovation Hubs trans-regionally, nationally and internationally will also help mitigate against significant risks for the fisheries and aquaculture industry including climate change, global pandemics and conflicts that can jeopardize fish and seafood production and supply chains. There is also a commensurate need to avail of digital technologies in order to increase awareness of key industry issues across the value chain, such as through social marketing. Thus, addressing key challenges by way of the global digital transformation of fishery and aquaculture industry will meet several sustainable development goals of the United Nations catered around the application of disruptive technology. © 2022 Shanghai Ocean University.

ABSTRACT: The production control for the mass individualisation paradigm of R&D-stage products is challenging due to the mix-flow and frequently-disturbed environment. With the convergence of the sustainable development goals and the increasing individualised demands in products, resilient manufacturing is envisioned in Industry 5.0 proposition. Concerning that conventional centralised production control methods suffer from low stability and inefficiency of decisions under frequent disruptions, this paper establishes a blockchained smart contract pyramid-driven multi-agent autonomous process control (BSCP-MAAPC) approach for improving the timeliness and adaptability of control towards resilient individualised manufacturing. Firstly, a blockchain-based multi-agent system architecture is designed based on agent encapsulation of manufacturing units. Blockchained smart contracts are used as the enabler of the multi-agent system for peer-to-peer negotiation and coordination of tasks. Secondly, a quad-play blockchained smart contract pyramid together with a series of decentralised control patterns are designed to enable the initial task dispatching of various individualised demands, as well as rapid dynamic adjustment of schedule in response to internal random disruptions. Finally, a blockchained smart contract pyramid-driven multi-agent autonomous process control system prototype is built in the ManuChain system, and experiments are conducted to analyze the proposed BSCP-MAAPC approach in different environments. HIGHLIGHTS A blockchained smart contract pyramid-driven multi-agent autonomous process control (BSCP-MAAPC) approach. A quad-play blockchained smart contract pyramid together with a series of decentralized control patterns. Blockchained smart contracts as the enabler of the multi-agent system for peer-to-peer negotiation and coordination of tasks. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Purpose:: Mainly in terms of human-machine interactions, this paper discusses salient issues related to work-based learning in reference to technologies in the Industry 5.0 era. Design/methodology/approach:: Several ideas are discussed based on recent thinking in the topic, putting forward visions that are likely to happen with Industry 5.0 revolution with prime focus on human-machine interactions. Findings:: The review elucidated a plethora of benefits in terms of human-machine interactions inasmuch as technology complements rather than replaces human efforts that includes enhancement of: efficiency and production, job security and skill-upgrading. To engender these benefits, however, legal, psychological, and ethical issues need to be transcended on the managerial level. Practical implications:: Positive externalities, associated with efficiency and production, are now possible with human-machine interactions without cost in terms of jobs being lost provided that skills are upgraded commensurate with the challenges posed by the new technological era. Social implications:: People can benefit from life improvements and elevated standards of living stemming from robotics though optimization of the use of technology. Originality:: This paper presents original ideas on how Industry 5.0 technologies can be harnessed to buoy sustainable development by striking an optimal balance between human and technological capital. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Benefiting from the marriage of just-in-time (JIT) and computer integrated manufacturing (CIM), a series of manufacturing planning and control (MPC) systems has been introduced for contemporary production and operations management. However, the increasing requirements for customized and personalized products and services, together with the acceleration of the socio-economic environment in the age of Industry 4.0, forced manufacturers to re-evaluate their current MPC strategies that mainly emphasize time, cost and quality priorities. Industry 4.0 presents a solid ambition for transforming to a digital, data-driven and interconnected manufacturing industry centred around cyber-physical convergence. Although the relevance of Industry 4.0 technologies' disruptions on operations management has been acknowledged, a significant gap in the evolution of the logic and design of MPC systems has been observed. The requirements of on-demand products and services with enhanced flexibility, resilience, sustainability and humanitarianism in this new industrial revolution call for innovations of MPC architectures and approaches. This paper first summarizes the evolution of MPC systems with enabling technologies and the changing business climate at that time. To explore innovative MPC that complies with the increasing economic, social and environmental requirements, the concept of synchronization-oriented MPC with four principles is proposed. Following the principles, a general framework for the synchronization-oriented MPC with enhanced economic, social and environmental benefits is developed. This work potentially provides insights into innovative MPC in the age of Industry 4.0 and even Industry 5.0. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The future of industry 4.0 which is called industry 5.0 is the crossroads between information technology and operational technology, converging on physical and virtual systems that were previously used separately in industrial manufacturing processes with a focus of western culture. In other words, the supply chain uses technology to create integration between people, processes, and products. SMEs owners, manufacturers, and service organizations can access unprecedented, new levels of data, which can make it easy to understand, control, and improve every aspect of their operations. In the present study, existing research work on the models and assessment readiness criteria for the adoption of industry 4.0 are over-viewed. In I4.0, hybrid organizations are a type of organizations that have two wings of social and environmental mission and economic wing. The business models of these organizations have blurred the line between for-profit and non-profit organizations so that hybrid organizations can fall into both for-profit / non-profit categories. Hybrid Entrepreneurs Seek Organizational Organizations and Markets to Address Specific Social and Environmental Issues. The characteristics of these organizations are creating value for healthy living, environmental and social justice, environmental sustainability, quality products and services. In this paper we did research the development of a readiness assessment framework for tomorrow's SMEs/hybrid SMEs or SME 5.0 which are small medium sized enterprises for getting prepared for the future concern for adopting the educational components of future of I4.0. © 2022 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Quadruple and Quintuple Helix Innovation Systems aim to optimize the design and operation of modern, democratic societies and economies in a smart, sustainable, inclusive, resilient and efficacious manner via the cyber-physical ecosystems that align with Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0 precepts. In this context, the Quintuple Innovation Helix Framework (which is part of the Quadruple/Quintuple Innovation Helix or Q2IH) represents the most comprehensive, meaningful and valuable construct and modality as it encompasses the five key core dimensions of modern, sustainable and democratic knowledge economies and societies. These are the Environment, the Civil Society as well as the Government, University and Industry dimensions. We strongly feel that it is appropriate and even critical, given current events in Europe that starkly highlight the conflict and struggle between democracies and autocracies, to enable, facilitate and even accelerate the further development of an Emerging Unified Theory of Helical Architectures (EUTOHA). The objective would be to bring clarity, coherence and consistency to the process of leveraging the helical architectures to advance and enhance the design of solutions for the digital transformation of modern knowledge economies and societies towards more democratic and sustainable (green) ones. © 2022 by E.G. Carayannis and D.F.J. Campbell.

ABSTRACT: The current stage of socio-economic development is focused on ensuring prosperity by meeting the goals and intensifying the practices of the 4th generation smart industry. The ways and methods of advancement are being scientifically researched and specified, while at the same time revealing errors and weaknesses in the development so far, which are the potential for continuous increase of prosperity and sustainable production and consumption. From this point of view, the paper analyses and more accurately formulates the effects of smart industry 4.0 on the economy and society in a global sense. In the context of the new industry 5.0 development concept identifies significant progress in automation, robotization and digitization of imaginary processes supporting economic growth with obvious reserves and risks in the social field, as well as in relation to sustainable development and climate strategies, especially in the environmental field. In the article, the authors present the concept of models for intensification and transition from the developed implementation model for Industry 4.0 to the environment and concepts of Industry 5.0. Priorities for the development and innovation of the fourth generation smart industry within the fifth generation concept and possible synergy effects from human-robot-machine-environment cooperation, especially in the social field and in ensuring the well-being of workers in industry, are formulated in more detail. © 2022, Politechnika Lubelska.

ABSTRACT: The recent shift to wellbeing, sustainability, and resilience under Industry 5.0 has prompted formal discussions that manufacturing should be human-centric – placing the wellbeing of industry workers at the center of manufacturing processes, instead of system-centric – only driven by efficiency and quality improvement and cost reduction. However, there is a lack of shared understanding of the essence of human-centric manufacturing, though significant research efforts exist in enhancing the physical and cognitive wellbeing of operators. Therefore, this position paper presents our arguments on the concept, needs, reference model, enabling technologies and system frameworks of human-centric manufacturing, providing a relatable vision and research agenda for future work in human-centric manufacturing systems. We believe human-centric manufacturing should ultimately address human needs defined in an Industrial Human Needs Pyramid – from basic needs of safety and health to the highest level of esteem and self-actualization. In parallel, human-machine relationships will change following a 5C evolution map – from current Coexistence, Cooperation and Collaboration to future Compassion and Coevolution. As such, human-centric manufacturing systems need to have bi-directional empathy, proactive communication and collaborative intelligence for establishing trustworthy human-machine coevolution relationships, thereby leading to high-performance human-machine teams. It is suggested that future research focus should be on developing transparent, trustworthy and quantifiable technologies that provide a rewarding working environment driven by real-world needs. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers

ABSTRACT: Emergence of industry 5.0 facilitates real-time synchronisation of production processes, which helps with the production of customized products. Although industry 5.0 can revolutionize the landscape of goods production, still its adoption is in the infancy stage. Hence, the purpose of this article is to examine barriers that impede the adoption of industry 5.0, and to propose solution initiatives (SIs). After an in-depth literature review and interviews with German industry experts in pharmaceutical sector, barriers and SIs are ranked using an integrated Analytical hierarchy process-elimination and choice expressing reality-decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (AHP-ELECTRE-DEMATEL) approach. &#x201C;Linking virtual reality and reality&#x201D; is found to be the most critical deterrent to the adoption of industry 5.0, and falls into a causal group, which signifies their influence on other deterrents. &#x201C;Measures for better connectivity with patients&#x201D; is of utmost importance for German firms to ensure secure communication and safeguard patient data. The findings also highlight the problems with the adoption of high-tech innovations due to lack of standardization and fair benchmarking policies on industry 5.0. This article concludes by proposing an industry 5.0 framework. The inhibitors to adopting industry 5.0 were investigated in this article, the results of which will assist practitioners and decision makers to understand the issues with industry 5.0. The results of this article will help potential adopters of this technology to look for the SIs. This will therefore pave the path for effective adoption of industry 5.0 across the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector. IEEE

ABSTRACT: Modern-day agriculture supply chains have evolved from sovereign and autonomous local stakeholders to a worldwide interconnected system of multiple participants linked by complicated interactions, impacting the production, processing, transportation, and delivery of food to end consumers. Regular instances of fraudulent acts reveal a lack of openness in agriculture supply chains, raising worries about financial losses, eroding customer trust, and lowering corporate brand value. To develop an efficient and reliable trading environment, several fundamental modifications in the present supply chain architecture are required. There is broad consensus that blockchain can improve transparency in agriculture-food supply chains (agri-food SCs). Consumers now demand safe, sustainable, and equitable food production processes, and businesses are using blockchains and the internet of things to meet these needs. For enhanced responsiveness in agri-food SCs, new concepts have evolved that combine blockchains with various Industry 5.0 technologies (e.g., blockchain technology, big data, internet of things (IoT), radio frequency identification (RFID), near field communication (NFC), etc.). It is critical to cut through the hype and examine the technology’s limits, which might stymie its acceptance, implementation, and scalability in agri-food supply chains. This study presents Agri-SCM-BIoT (Agriculture Supply Chain Management using Blockchain and Internet of things) architecture to address the storage and scalability optimization, interoperability, security and privacy issues security, and privacy of personal data along with storage concerns with present single-chain agriculture supply chain systems. We also discussed the classification of security threats with IoT infrastructure and possible available blockchain-based defense mechanisms. Finally, we discussed the features of the proposed supply chain architecture, followed by a conclusion and future work. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: We are still in the midst of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), with more manufacturing lines being labeled as smart thanks to the integration of advanced ICT in Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS). While I4.0 aims to provision cognitive CPS systems, the nascent Industry 5.0 (I5.0) era goes a step beyond, aiming to build cross-border, sustainable, and circular value chains benefiting society as a whole. An enabler of this vision is the integration of data and AI in the industrial decision-making process, which does not exhibit yet a coordination between the Operation and Information Technology domains (OT/IT). This work proposes an architectural approach and an accompanying software prototype addressing the OT/IT convergence problem. The approach is based on a two-layered middleware solution, where each layer aims to better serve the specific differentiated requirements of the OT and IT layers. The proposal is validated in a real testbed, employing actual machine data, showing the capacity of the components to gracefully scale and serve increasing data volumes. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Quadruple and Quintuple Helix innovation systems are based on democracy and ecology. Two propositions are here key: (1) without a democracy or knowledge democracy, the further advancement of knowledge and innovation are seriously constrained, so in that sense, knowledge and innovation evolution depend on democracy and knowledge democracy; (2) ecology and environmental protection represent a necessity and challenge for humanity, but they also act as drivers for further knowledge and innovation (this should lead to a win–win situation for ecology and innovation). Therefore, for an innovation system to be a Quadruple/Quintuple Helix innovation system, the political regime hosting these helixes needs to be democratic in essence, not just in form. The next stage in evolution of innovation systems may be that this also will require a “democracy of climate” (promoting a social, cultural, economic, and political “climate for democracy”), where democracies as innovation enablers are creating innovation that regard the ecology as a crucial driver for further innovation and for responsible innovation. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Big Data, the Internet of Things, and robotic and augmented realities are just some of the technologies that belong to Industry 4.0. These technologies improve working conditions and increase productivity and the quality of industry production. However, they can also improve life and society as a whole. A new perspective is oriented towards social well-being and it is called Society 5.0. Industry 4.0 supports the transition to the new society, but other drivers are also needed. To guide the transition, it is necessary to identify the enabling factors that integrate Industry 4.0. A conceptual framework was developed in which these factors were identified through a literature review and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) methodology. Furthermore, the way in which they relate was evaluated with the help of the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) methodology. The proposed framework fills a research gap, which has not yet consolidated a strategy that includes all aspects of Society 5.0. As a result, the main driver, in addition to technology, is international politics. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Industry 5.0 follows the idea of continuous digitization and transfer to digital factory. Industries must adopt the green and digital transitions to continue to be competitive. Besides the preservation of resources, climate change, the social stability is in the focus. Industries strive to become more resilient against external disturbances, such as Covid-19 crisis. Work environment considerably affects the productivity, health and safety of workers. Monitoring of the working environment with reliable miniaturized technology can guarantee suitable working conditions. In the line with the EU Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work 2014-2020, one of EU-OSHA's priorities is to fortify the prevention of work-related diseases. © 2021, MM publishing Ltd..

ABSTRACT: Currently, there is growing attention towards improving sustainability, including the worldwide agenda in moving towards Society 5.0. Since the formulation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the green logistics issue has been widely recognized as one crucial element to reducing environmental and social impact. Nevertheless, only a few studies in this area were established since the ignorance regarding this issue was immense globally, including in the Malaysian context. This paper intends to examine the relationship of organizational performance consciousness, economic performance consciousness, and environmental performance consciousness towards green logistics consciousness in enlightening environmental and social sustainability in the Malaysian situation. The data of 387 respondents throughout Malaysia were collected using a convenience survey sampling technique. This data was initially analyzed via descriptive, validity, reliability, and normality test using IBM SPSS Statistics. All hypotheses were analysed using the hierarchical regression analysis, which confirmed that organizational performance consciousness, economic performance consciousness, and environmental performance consciousness directly influence green logistics consciousness in Malaysia. This study is significant and crucial for business strategies formulation, predicting and assessing the potential environmental and social impacts of a proposed project, including evaluating alternatives, designing appropriate mitigation, management and monitoring measures via several entities such as government and policymakers. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Internet of Things (IoT) can help to pave the way to the circular economy and to a more sustainable world by enabling the digitalization of many operations and processes, such as water distribution, preventive maintenance, or smart manufacturing. Paradoxically, IoT technologies and paradigms such as edge computing, although they have a huge potential for the digital transition towards sustainability, they are not yet contributing to the sustainable development of the IoT sector itself. In fact, such a sector has a significant carbon footprint due to the use of scarce raw materials and its energy consumption in manufacturing, operating, and recycling processes. To tackle these issues, the Green IoT (G-IoT) paradigm has emerged as a research area to reduce such carbon footprint; however, its sustainable vision collides directly with the advent of Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI), which imposes the consumption of additional energy. This article deals with this problem by exploring the different aspects that impact the design and development of Edge-AI G-IoT systems. Moreover, it presents a practical Industry 5.0 use case that illustrates the different concepts analyzed throughout the article. Specifically, the proposed scenario consists in an Industry 5.0 smart workshop that looks for improving operator safety and operation tracking. Such an application case makes use of a mist computing architecture composed of AI-enabled IoT nodes. After describing the application case, it is evaluated its energy consumption and it is analyzed the impact on the carbon footprint that it may have on different countries. Overall, this article provides guidelines that will help future developers to face the challenges that will arise when creating the next generation of Edge-AI G-IoT systems. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Managing a sustainable supply chain is a concept related to many areas of the economy. Its efficient functioning depends on the implementation of SDG activities and the development of industry (first-fourth/fifth industrial revolution). Due to the likelihood of different priorities in the implementation of the sustainable development goals, it is important to build such relationships, e.g. in the supply chain, so that their implementation could take place under similar conditions. Digitization, or the circular economy concept (CE), create an opportunity for the SME sector to build relationships as part of industry networks, for instance, where the managed supply chain would have a common and realistic goal to achieve. This goal will be a priority in business models based on sustainable development. The article presents the results of research regarding the furniture industry in Poland (key industry, referred to as smart specialization). The results of the analysis show that the industry has a large production potential, and the natural resources used in it are constantly increasing. However, there are doubts raised by the lack of stability in the dynamics of the sold production in the industry. Ultimately, the business model of the industry supply chain should focus on the environmental aspect (sustainable management of the raw material supply chain) and on eco-friendly consumption (sustainable management of the product supply chain), so that it can be managed in a sustainable way. © 2021 Anna Wiśniewska-Sałek, published by Sciendo.

ABSTRACT: With their technology-centric developments, Industry 4.0 and digitization have a positive influence on manufacturing companies. They enable companies to deal with the increasing complexity and volatility of the production environment. Thereby, their technology- and economy-driven orientation is still in focus. Currently, a true, fully human-centered development is missing. The concept of Industry 5.0 addresses this issue. This article presents six approaches from research that support companies in the long term in overcoming current challenges and thereby focus on the humans in the development of solutions. © 2021 Carl Hanser Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Digitalization is rushing throughout the world, namely, in industrial and societal infrastructures. Hence, digital transformation becomes a pillar of industrial policy, known in Europe as “Industry 4.0,” in China as “made in China 2025,” in Asia as “Smart Cities,” in Japan as “Society 5.0,” and in North America as “Industrial Internet.” These transformations will change the industrial landscape, toward Quality 4.0 and therefore, our lives. The presented research was conducted on quality management employees in Portugal and it aims to analyze if such employees have the perception of the impact of Industry 4.0 in the quality management profession and the required and needed skills. After analyzing the answered questionnaires, 90 results were considered valid. This is the sample of our study. Simultaneously, the goal of this research is also to review and analyze the main topics in progress related to quality management for the fourth industrial revolution and how quality emerges of this change. The professionals that work on quality management must have creative thinking, be leaders, know how to communicate and work as a team, as well as, to have knowledge and understanding of ICT (Information and Communications Technology), and main pillars of Industry 4.0. These are the main findings. Besides that, they must know how to motivate their work teams, be open to change, know how to use Big Data to make decisions and above all, they must know how to manage conflicts. In addition, quality professionals must promote the design and production of first class products, be the defenders of their customers within the organi-zation, and finally, they must create value for the stakeholders. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: There is a high demand for clean, affordable and sustainable source of energy due to the limitation in fossil fuel supplies. The algae industrial revolutions have proved to be a significant step to realize the growing need for energy and achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs). In this review, the production and processing of algae from an industry point of view and the algae processing in Industry 4.0 as well as a paradigmatic shift from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 were well-delineated. Moreover, numerous aspects in the algae industry have been discussed, including economic and environmental analysis of algae bioenergy production, customization of the algae-derived bioenergy, algae cultivation and modifications in the cultivating approach. Genetic engineering tools implemented in the algae culture for bioenergy and by-products generation was also studied, and area of focusing such as the desired algae strain and its detection through automated genetic manipulation and genetic modification. Furthermore, the impacts of the Industry 5.0 on the new market opportunities and environment aspect as well as the possibility of achieving SDGs were significantly studied. © 2020 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: The execution of material handling tasks using autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) has proven a real success during the last decade. Nevertheless, the installation of AGVs is costly as it needs to modify the workshop's configuration by defining dedicated movement zones. Recently, more flexible and collaborative mobile robots known as autonomous intelligent robots (AIV) can be used in manufacturing systems. This new generation of intelligent mobile robots does not need specific zones and can interact with unexpected or mobile obstacles such as human operators. This paper focuses on AIV fleet size definition in a variable and unexpected environment with humans while keeping AIV assigned transportation tasks on time. A simulation that model the complexity of the AIV travel time estimation under the mentioned circumstances and the improvement brought by IoT, Big Data and sensors by using them as the real-time data source is developed. © 2021 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Manufacturing systems under Industry 4.0, and their transition towards Industry 5.0, take into account the Quintuple Helix innovation model, associated with the sustainable development goals (SDGs) set by the UN and Horizon 2030, in which companies focus on operational efficiency in terms of the use and minimisation of resources for the protection of the environment. In this respect, the implementation of the circular economy model, which requires engineers to acquire appropriate competencies, enabling companies to establish this model at the manufacturing level. Moreover, competence has always been a priority for both the professional and the company. In this sense, connectivism has been called a learning theory for the digital era; this is the reason why a review of the state-of-the-art developments of this paradigm focused on engineering has been carried out. In this sense, the potential of the digital transformation in instruction to formulate an engineering model based on neuro-competences is of great interest, taking the connectivist paradigm as a methodological axis. To this end, a first bibliometric analysis has been carried out to identify the drivers on which to base the design of the neuro-competencies of the instructional engineering environment and the trend towards curriculum development under dual training models. The bibliographical research carried out on the connectivist paradigm has served to identify the trends followed to date in education within the subject area of engineering. These trends have not fully taken into account the leading role of the human factor within the socio-technical cyber-physical systems of sustainable manufacturing (SCSSM). The focus was more on the technology than on the adaptation of the uniqueness of the human factor and the tasks entrusted to him, which entails an additional complexity that needs to be addressed in both academic and professional contexts. In light of the foregoing, an improvement to the acquisition and management of competencies has been proposed to the academic, professional and dual engineering contexts. It is based on the transversal inclusion of the concept of neuro-competence applied to the competence engineering (CE) model, transforming it into the neuro-competence engineering (NCE) model. The foregoing provides a better match between the characteristics of the human factor and the uniqueness of the tasks performed by the engineer, incorporating activity theory (AT), the law of variety required (LVR), the connectivist paradigm and neuroscience as a transversal driver of innovation through fractality. This proposal enables a ubiquitous and sustainable learning model throughout the entire academic and professional life cycle of the engineer, placing it sustainably at the heart of the instructional and professional cyber-physical socio-technical system, thus complying with the SDGs set by the UN and Horizon 2030. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This review presents an analysis of three hypotheses. The articles provide a specific perspective on green housing before, during, and post COVID-19. The validations of these hypotheses were performed by analyzing the scientific literature worldwide and by adding a statistical analysis of appropriate articles from the Scopus database. The purpose of this review is to overview the research written on housing developments during the upsurge of COVID-19 along with the responses from the green building sector, because this field appears to be rapidly emerging by the sheer volume of research studies currently undertaken. Foremost peer-reviewed journals covering construction, urban studies, real estate, energy, civil engineering, buildings, indoor air, management, economics, business, environmental studies, and environmental sciences that were published last year were selected for review. The review was conducted by applying a combination of various keywords and the criteria for paper selection, including sustainable building, green construction, green building, resource-efficient, a building’s lifecycle, COVID-19, energy, water, consumption, health effects, comfort, occupant behaviors, policy, economy, Industry 5.0, energy-efficient retrofitting, and profit. Two, innovative elements in this study stand out when comparing it with the most advanced research on green housing before, during, and after COVID-19. The first innovation relates to the integrated analyses of COVID-19 pandemic, housing policies of countries and cities pertinent to COVID-19 that impact green housing and the wellbeing of their residents as well as the impact made by residents and a housing policy on the dispersion of COVID-19. This research additionally establishes that a green building analysis is markedly more effective when the analysis comprehensively covers the life process of a green building, the participating interest groups that have their own goals they wish to implement, the COVID-19 situation, and the external micro- and macro-level environments as a singular entity. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Human Factor strategy and management have been affected by the incorporation of Key Enabling Technologies (KETs) of industry 4.0, whereby operator 4.0 has been configured to address the wide variety of cooperative activities and to support skills that operate in VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous) environments under the interaction with ubiquitous interfaces on real and virtual hybrid environments of cyber-physical systems. Current human Competences-Capacities that are supported by the technological enablers could result in a radically disempowered human factor. This means that in the processes of optimization and improvement of manufacturing systems from industry 4.0 to industry 5.0, it would be necessary to establish strategies for the empowerment of the human factor, which constitute symbiotic and co-evolutionary socio-technical systems through talent, sustainability, and innovation. This paper establishes a new framework for the design and development of occupational environments 5.0 for the inclusion of singularized operators 4.0, such as individuals with special capacities and talents. A case study for workers and their inclusion in employment is proposed. This model integrates intelligent and inclusive digital solutions in the current workspaces of organizations under digital transformation. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Industry 4.0 is about smart production, IoT, sensors and drones. Industry 5.0 will be about connecting smart production to human cognition, collaboration and creativity. To this end, progress will be judged on not just the connection of data between the Internet of Things (IoT), but how that connectivity enhances the human experience and shortens the time to achieve environmental safety competencies. This paper discusses how companies such as Shell are deploying more personalized worker experiences to serve the new industrial agenda of achieving the goals of both, the enterprise as well as continually ensure the welfare of humans. Specifically, the paper discusses how: Experiential simulation-based learning strategies such as Operator Training Simulators have become more mobile, on-demand and collaborative in order to drive more personalized worker experiences AI infused microlearning tailored to industrial operations staff is used to build upon an individual's learning profile, identify strengths and weaknesses and provide timely reinforcement learning content Virtual Reality platforms can be used to address behavioral needs, where frontline staff can be trained and evaluated on decision-making and real-time choices when faced with unexpected or infrequent situations in the simulated plant. Using real-life scenarios, these solutions can help instill responsible behavior and boost safety performance across both assets and teams Microsoft Power Apps now allow citizen development of solutions by those closest to the opportunity. The age of mass personalization within an Industry 5.0 world is here and will undoubtedly seeks to achieve large-scale impact, one individual at a time. © 2021 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

ABSTRACT: WT is one of the most important and advancing technologies of sustainable energies due to their challenged energy resources that can be very profitable, principally for commercial scale production of electrical power. Composite materials stiffness and strength of the blade structure are essential of WT and should be accurately designed as they play a decisive role in inhancing the turbine performance and durability. Mechanical elasticity analysis and damage evolution of the blade structure are the main issues in studying the behavior of composite structures, instead of that the modal and random vibration analysis are also the main of interest of studying such as dynamic structures.In this paper, methods and approaches of composite materials enhancement of WT blades are reviewed, including some numerical methods used in this context. Hence, the recent research results of WT technologies with historical results achieved are explored. This numerical models are assessed the performance of WT and optimization procedures applied to blade conception. A good attention has been paid to know about the recent optimization strategies of WT blade proposed for the engineers and researchers. Besides, the industry 5.0 involves for using AI techniques to facilitate the exploitation of numerical data from the whole numerical studies of mechanical behavior of composite materials such as elasticity, plasticity, damage initiation and damage tolerance using a well-known commercial software solver. © 2021 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: The fourth industrial revolution carries with it various expectations for the future of sustainable and effective development. Industry 4.0 takes a significant part of everyday life. There is no way. The application of digital life on smart phones, touch screens and smart classrooms may be significant indicators of this. Not just computer information and life but also human-like robotics would take a long time. In the immediate future, you will also see the picture of a modern 5.0 model for manufacturing. Since of emerging technology and increasingly evolving and increasing AI-based approaches, remaining on the top is getting more and more challenging. Robots are much more relevant as now the brain-machine's technology can be merged with the human mind, as artificial intelligence advances. There are coercive problems in the world economy because efficiency is to be improved without the human workforce being robbed of the manufacturing sector. This paper presents the idea of sustainable business 5.0, where machines are intertwined with the human brain and function as partners rather than rivals, against these obstacles. In addition, the effect of Industry 5.0, which is more likely to create more jobs than to reduce, will be discussed on manufacturing and the economy as a whole. The paper describes modern technology, from IoT to news. Thanks to our view, the integration of these innovations would turn industry 4.0 into industry 5.0. © 2021 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Constantly changing project environment and a new paradigm shift to a more human-centred and sustainable Industry 5.0 has also brought about a need for a new project management style. Over the last decades, more flexible and people-oriented agile project management (APM) approaches have emerged. Due to its many benefits, APM has already become a mainstream in software industry, and is now increasingly being transferred to other industry sectors. In this paper, we present some basic guidelines for manufacturing SMEs on how to increase their agility without having to undergo a complete agile transformation that requires high financial and non-financial resources. The guidelines are based on three key pillars: concurrent product development, APM, and modern technologies, and are focused on achieving both high project efficiency and stakeholders’ satisfaction. © 2021 Samo Drobne – Lidija Zadnik Stirn – Mirjana Kljajić Borštnar – Janez Povh – Janez Žerovnik

ABSTRACT: Industry 5.0 has laid the necessity to relocate the human at the center of the manufacturing cycle, where everything should be designed to ease his/her work. This implies one to redefine the human-robot collaboration, making it not only safe, but also more inclusive for the operator. Nowadays, this goal is viable thanks to the integration of new sensors in the work cell. Coupled with advanced control strategies, they give the robot a better understanding of both the surrounding environment and the human movement, allowing a more organic cooperation. This paper exploits an RGBD camera and Deep Learning algorithms to retrieve the 3D positions of the manipulated objects in the workspace and to infer the most likely future human destinations in a pick and place case study. Merging this information, a proper control logic is defined and tested in a real robotics application, with the final intent of minimizing human-robot collisions during the collaboration and making the process more reliable and efficient. © 2021 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Enterprises and information societies confront crucial challenges currently, while Industry 4.0 becomes important in the global manufacturing industry and Society 5.0 should contribute to a supersmart society, especially for healthcare. Physical activity monitoring digital platforms are architected to improve the healthcare status of patients with diabetes and other lifestyle-related diseases. Furthermore, digital platforms are expected to generate profits for health technology companies and help control costs in the healthcare ecosystem. However, current digital enterprise architecture approaches are not well-established, and the potentials have not yet been realized. Design thinking approach and agile software development methodologies can overcome these limitations, beginning with proof of concept and pilot projects and then scaling to the production environment. In this paper, we describe how that the adaptive integrated digital architecture framework (AIDAF) for Design Thinking approach is proposed and verified in a case of a university hospital in the Americas. In addition, challenges and future activities for this area are discussed that cover the directions for Society 5.0. © 2021 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: In this position paper, we discuss the socio-technical perspective of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The fourth industrial revolution refers to the novel wave of advanced technologies – like Robotics, the Internet of Things, Big Data – that are adopted in manufacturing organisations. Scholars and practitioners have forecasted the fourth industrial revolution, and it is still underway. This situation allowed the proliferation of various visions in the fourth industrial revolution literature: Industry 4.0, the socially sustainable factory of Operator 4.0 and Industry 5.0. Through a literature review, we analyse the manifesto and pivotal papers of such visions in order to assess how they employ the socio-technical perspective. The results show that Industry 4.0 vision mainly considers the technical system. The vision of the socially sustainable factory of Operator 4.0 is an attempt to consider the social system in conjunction with the technical system. Then, Industry 5.0 vision is socio-technical in nature and also takes into consideration sustainability outcomes. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

ABSTRACT: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is the concrete practice of sustainable development at the enterprise level, emphasizing the human value in the production process. The proposal of Industry 5.0 begins to take the coordinated development between human and various production factors as one of the key points of corporate sustainable management. Therefore, this paper studies the optimization of medical enterprise's operations management considering enterprise CSR under Industry 5.0. A mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is developed to maximize the CSR with the consideration of the impact of precision medical technologies such as surgical robots (SRs) and 3D bone printing on employee social welfare, corporate profits, social environment, and customer surplus value. An improved variable neighborhood tabu search (IVNTS) algorithm which combines the variable neighborhood tabu search (VNTS) algorithm and simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is designed to solve the model, and numerical experiments are analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed IVNTS. The research aids medical enterprise to make reasonable operations management decisions, while providing a reference for the government to draft and implement related policies, thereby achieving sustainable social development. © 2021 Qian Zhang et al.

ABSTRACT: Industry 5.0 follows the steps of the Industry 4.0 paradigm and seeks for revolutionizing the way industries operate. In fact, Industry 5.0 focuses on research and innovation to support industrial production sustainability and place the well-being of industrial workers at the center of the production process. Thus, Industry 5.0 relies on three pillars: It is human-centric, it encourages sustainability and it is aimed at developing resilience against disruptions. Such core aspects cannot be fully achieved without a transparent end-to-end human-centered traceability throughout the value chain. As a consequence, Auto-Identification (Auto-ID) technologies play a key role, since they are able to provide automated item recognition, positioning and tracking without human intervention or in cooperation with industrial operators. Although the most popular Auto-ID technologies provide a certain degree of security and productivity, there are still open challenges for future Industry 5.0 factories. This article analyzes and evaluates the Auto-ID landscape and delivers a holistic perspective and understanding of the most popular and the latest technologies, looking for solutions that cope with harsh, diverse and complex industrial scenarios. In addition, it describes a methodology for selecting Auto-ID technologies for Industry 5.0 factories. Such a methodology is applied to a specific use case of the shipbuilding industry that requires identifying the main components of a ship during its construction and repair. To validate the outcomes of the methodology, a practical evaluation of passive and active UHF RFID tags was performed in an Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV) under construction, showing that a careful selection and evaluation of the tags enables product identification and tracking even in areas with a very high density of metallic objects. As a result, this article serves as a useful guide for industrial stakeholders, including future developers and managers that seek for deploying identification and traceability technologies in Industry 5.0 scenarios. © 2013 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: The fifth industrial revolution brings in massive advantages, providing candidates with a more personalized experience in their job search. Industry 5.0 recognizes the power of industry in achieving societal goals beyond jobs and growth to become a resilient provider of prosperity by directing production towards respecting the boundaries of our planet and placing the well-being of the industry worker at the center of the production process. Contrary to the trends in Industry 4.0 toward technology, dehumanization, technological advancement and innovation best practices, Industry 5.0 will bend back toward serving humanity. At workplaces, this industrial revolution will shed greater light on the human intelligence than ever. The challenge now is to examine the influence of soft skills to enhance the workforce in order to prepare them for Industry 5.0. Emotional intelligence is a soft skill. The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of emotional intelligence on enhancing the workforce for Industry 5.0. A total of 110 executives took part in this study. Findings suggest that emotional intelligence does influence the workforce to perform better. Emotional recognition and expression and emotions direct cognition were found to have a greater impact on the performance. Copyright © 2021. Susan Tee Suan CHIN.

ABSTRACT: Smart and (partially) autonomous systems are today's drivers of innovation and economic respectively societal disruptive changes: in all industrial and social areas highly automated or autonomous intelligent systems are taking over tasks and services - and maybe, one day, control of our lives. This is a considerable risk to democracy, human independence and human rights, raising ethical questions. However, conventional technologies have also an impact, particularly on excessive exploitation of natural resources, climate change and inequality in global economy and society. The concept of circular economy became a focus when thinking about a more sustainable future. We are now seeing many communities and businesses adopt novel approaches based on circularity. European policy has reacted to the challenges of climate change and environmental footprint reduction particularly in context of production, transport, farming and large urban agglomerations - smartness (intelligence) is not only addressing well-being, assisted living and comfort of citizens (keyword “Society 5.0”), but even more sustainability goals in the long term. The European Green Deal is a commitment to future generations, while the European Green Cities movement addresses many of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and manages a network of cities for collaboration and experience exchange by developing innovative projects. © 2021 IDIMT 2021 - Pandemics: Impacts, Strategies and Responses, 29th Interdisciplinary Information Management Talks All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: In recent years manufacturing and assembly lines are undergoing workplace changes with a scope to adapt to the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) design principles. Automation of manufacturing, collaborative robots (cobots), interconnection of cyber physical systems (CPS), cloud computing, big data analytics and Augmented/Virtual reality (AR/VR) are some of the technologies that are being introduced in industry. Human operators are required to adapt and integrate into those new environments. Human operators should be flexible in their work-tasks, upgrade their skillset and be able to act as a safeguard entity in this complex and dynamic environment. A recent shift in paradigms, the Industry 5.0 concept, focus on the sustainability of the human factor inside the technologies that I4.0 framework introduced, and relates to the ageing workforce issue and the change in individuals’ capabilities. Productivity and safety of the ageing operators in the new workplace environment is causally related to their capabilities. In this research paper, we (i) study the interactions of human operator inside the “smart” workplace and (ii) develop a model using the entropy concept of statistical mechanics. This model can be utilized in the evaluation of human factor inside the complex environment by computing the probability of error based on human operator capabilities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: Farming is a complex and responsive business that considers types of soils and crops, topography, climate, etc., while minimising inputs like land and water for an optimal yield. Typically, a farm to be managed involves planting, irrigation, spraying of nutrients and pesticides, manual inspection when looking for signals of harvesting stress or pest infestation, etc. When these activities are unreliable, yields of crops fluctuate so do the enterprise margins. However, to reach higher levels of performance, today's agribusiness moves towards more sustainable and efficient operations within the so-called precision agriculture. From such a scenario, a process system engineering assessment is proposed to evaluate the impacts of industry 4.0 (I4) applications under circular economy (CE) concepts in the agricultural field. Particularly, we highlight drones or unmanned aerial vehicles as a tool in the agroindustry since numerous researchers and industries are designing and testing different principles and technologies that could be applied by replacing manpower with drones in engineering fields. A sensitivity risk analysis compares the I4 adoption and its CE impacts against an outdated agricultural-based production structure for corn production. It has been evaluated using subjective ratings for twenty sub-process components such as irrigation, monitoring, among others. The findings indicate that investments in agricultural drones’ capabilities will modify sub-processes under CE principles, resulting in a process system re-engineering in this field. Agricultural drones can increase the economy of the processes coupled with environmentally friendly applications, whereby the impact on the social pillar of the CE is still debatable. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Technological competitiveness and emerging technologies are more necessary in the organizational strategy to cope with industrial advances and improve the nation’s economy. In this sense, technological innovation, computational developments, smart devices, and other technologies are shaping the new industrial revolutions. Therefore, the technological competitiveness and emerging technologies of industry 4.0 and industry 5.0 are holistically analyzed to identify the key elements of developed economies and emerging economies. For this, we used a bibliometric analysis with Biblioshiny, a systematic review of the literature and a content analysis. The results in terms of technological competitiveness in developed economies show the importance of the competences and engineering skills in the personnel approach; R+D+i and the supply chain in the organizational approach; and the use of emerging technologies such as the internet of things and big data. The comparison with emerging economies indicates the importance of key elements such as training and education, and skills in the personnel approach; sustainability and structure in the organizational approach; and emerging technologies such as the internet of things and digitalization. © 2021, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is 1) to investigate the effects on the crucial Industry 4.0 technological innovations that interact between the real and virtual worlds and that are applied in the sustainable supply chain process; 2) to contribute to the identification of the opportunities, the challenges and the gaps that will support the new research study developments and 3) to analyze the impact of the Industry 4.0 technologies as facilitators of the sustainable supply chain performance in the midst of the Coronavirus (COVID-19). Design/methodology/approach: This research is performed through a bibliographic review in the electronic databases of the Emerald Insight, the Scopus and the Web of Science, considering the main scientific publications on the subject. Findings: The bibliographic search results in 526 articles, followed by two sequential filters for deleting the duplicate articles (resulting in 487 articles) and for selecting the most relevant articles (resulting in 150 articles). Practical implications: This article identifies the opportunities and the challenges focused on the emerging Industry 4.0 theme. The opportunities can contribute to the sustainable performance of the supply chains and their territories. The Industry 4.0 can also generate challenges like the social inequalities related to the position of the man in the labor market by replacing the human workforce with the machines. Therefore, the man-machine relationship in the Industry 4.0 era is analyzed as a gap in the literature. Therefore, as a way to fill this gap, the authors of this article suggest the exploration of the research focused on the Society 5.0. Also known as “super-smart society,” this recent theme appeared in Japan in April 2016. According to Fukuda (2020), in addition to the focus on the technological development, the Society 5.0 also aims at the quality of life and the social challenge resolutions. Originality/value: This article contributes to the analysis of the Industry 4.0 technologies as facilitators in the sustainable supply chain performance. It addresses the impacts of the Industry 4.0 technologies applied to the supply chains in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it analyzes the research gaps and limitations found in the literature. The result of this study can add value and stimulate new research studies related to the application of the Industry 4.0 technologies as facilitators in the supply chain sustainable performance. It can encourage the studies related to the COVID-19 impacts on the sustainable supply chains, and it can promote the research development on the relationship among the man, the machine and the labor in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Industry 4.0 has brought about a revolution in how the manufacturing industry operates, from the product concept generation to the automated, high-tech factories that fabricate the products. Manufacturing systems are fully integrated, multi-robot and collaborative. The key elements of Industry 4.0 are information and communications technology (ICT), connectedness, sensor technology, robotics and innovative production systems. Smart manufacturing systems producing smart products. The result of this highly automated environment of Industry 4.0 is that the humans are at risk of no longer playing a valuable role. This paper asks the following questions: Can we ensure that humans have a place in the highly automated workplace of the future (Industry 5.0) by optimizing human capital? Can the traditional educational provider supply the skills required to educate this modern worker or do we require an innovative educational system? © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: Industry 5.0, the fifth industrial revolution, consists of smart digital information and manufacturing technologies. This industrial revolution generates effective processes and makes rapid improvement in industries and healthcare. Solutions to challenges posed by COVID-19 pandemic can be identified with the deployment of Industry 5.0-based technologies. It helps to provide personalized therapy and treatment processes to the COVID-19 patients if a detailed patient's information is available. The aim of Industry 5.0 technologies is to create a smart healthcare environment with real-time capabilities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, these technologies can provide a remote monitoring system in healthcare. This paper identifies and studies major technologies of Industry 5.0 helpful for the COVID-19 pandemic. The supportive features of Industry 5.0 for the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed diagrammatically. Finally, we identified and studied significant challenges faced in the context of Industry 5.0 technologies for the COVID-19 pandemic. The literature revealed that this technological innovation allows a high personalization level to fulfill personal specific demands of the patient and doctors. These technologies play a significant role in making the life of doctors better. Further, doctors can use this technology to focus on critically infected patients and provide proper appropriate information regarding their better treatment. Moreover, Industry 5.0 technologies can help doctors and medical students for required medical training during this COVID-19 outbreak. © World Scientific Publishing Co.

ABSTRACT: Background and purpose: The transformation to Industry 4.0 increases the number of robots installed within industries, which brings great shifts in industrial ecosystems. For this reason, our research goal was to analyze the key performance indicators to investigate the economic and social sustainability of the changes in production. Methodology: The combination of official (World Bank, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) and publicly available (Federal Reserve Economic Data, Industrial Federation of Robotics) data was used for statistical data processing, including comparison, correlation, cross-correlation and vector autoregression analysis, to present the past developments and also to predict future trends within the U.S. manufacturing sector. Results: In contrast to robust industry robotization observed in the 2008-2018 period, the share of manufacturing output and employment declined. Nonetheless, the vector autoregression model forecast shows, that the U.S. manufacturing sector has arrived at a turning point, after which robotization can increase employment and labor productivity of workers, while also stimulating further growth of their education levels. Conclusion: The transition to Industry 4.0 has a major impact on increasing demands for new knowledge and skills for increased productivity. Accordingly, forecasted growths of analyzed manufacturing indicators suggest that negative impacts of robotization in the recent past were only temporary, due to the entrance to the Industry 4.0 era. Nonetheless, additional policies to support sustainable industry development are required. © 2020 Katarina Rojko et al., published by Sciendo 2020.

ABSTRACT: The goal of industrial revolutions is not only to improve and respond directly to the needs of industry in a productive side fact, but also to improve the standard of living of society and make life easier for customers. Therefore, economic growth should always go hand in hand with each industrial revolution. In this context, the increasing demand for electricity, the non-renewable nature of conventional sources and the rising price of fuel, are considered the constraints of the 21st century and need to be definitively managed in order to meet the constantly increasing demand for electricity from the population in the best possible conditions. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are the foundation on which tomorrow's innovative solutions are created. However, smart embedded systems and the internet are two major players driving ICT technologies forward. These technologies have impacted several sectors, where we find a crossroads of several industrial sectors: medical, manufacturing, automation, energy and others. The application these technologies in a smart grid framework with the integration of renewable energy sources and used for an optimization and efficiency mission let Internet of Things (IoT) to take the sustainable and industrial character and named Green Industrial Internet of Things (GIIoT). This last, seems to be a promoting axis for the development of future applications. In this paper, we present an overview of the impact of the Internet of Things on the evolution of applications in relation to the different revolutions, an inventory of the different industrial revolutions, an overview of the GIIoT as well as some applications and perspectives. © 2020

ABSTRACT: Are new technologies in the medicine sector a driver to support the development of a society 5.0? Innovation pushes the artisan to become smart and lean, customer-oriented but within a standardized environment of production, maintaining and ensuring the quality of the product. An artisan is a user and innovator, as an essential part of the industrial chain. In the healthcare sector, the doctor is the industrial artisan, and medicine can be considered as an example of a smart tool, strongly tailored, that embeds the innovation of materials, nano-devices, and smart technology (e.g., sensors and controllers). But how much of society is ready to host smart technology “on board”, becoming “on life”, constantly connected with remote controls that allow us to monitor, gather data, and, in any case, act, with preventive healthcare solutions? After a short overview of the medicine sector, a preliminary, tentative link between technological innovation and the healthcare sector allows us to adopt several outlooks on how to change research, always more transdisciplinary, combining science with social science in order to remain human-centered. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: To conduct, in an effective way, the non-destructive testing (NDT) of products-in particular, the fluorescent penetrant inspection (FPI)-remains a challenge. Therefore, the aim of this work is to propose the method of support in the choice of a fluorescent penetrant to be used in FPI research. In the results of the usage of the proposed procedure, it is demonstrated that it is possible to reduce the negative impacts on the environment by FPI processes (through sustainability), while including other criteria, i.e., financial, security, productive (Industry 4.0), and societal (Society 5.0) criteria. The essence of the proposed method is to integrate two methods of decision support. These were the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method and the cost-quality analysis (AKJ). Using the AHP method, the quality level of fluorescent penetrant (to the satisfaction of the customer)-which included the sustainability criteria-are calculated. These criteria include natural environment, reactivity, combustibility, level of sensitivity, and type of washing (emulsification). Then, with the help of the AKJ, the most favorable penetrant-in terms of quality and cost-is calculated and, thus, indicated. This choice must include the concept of sustainable development. Therefore, this method can be used to choose fluorescent penetrants in manufacturing and service enterprises which carry out FPI. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in a smart society, in which the analysis of human habits is mandatory, requires automated data scheduling and analysis using smart applications, a smart infrastructure, smart systems, and a smart network. In this context, which is characterized by a large gap between training and operative processes, a dedicated method is required to manage and extract the massive amount of data and the related information mining. The method presented in this work aims to reduce this gap with near-zero-failure advanced diagnostics (AD) for smart management, which is exploitable in any context of Society 5.0, thus reducing the risk factors at all management levels and ensuring quality and sustainability. We have also developed innovative applications for a human-centered management system to support scheduling in the maintenance of operative processes, for reducing training costs, for improving production yield, and for creating a human–machine cyberspace for smart infrastructure design. The results obtained in 12 international companies demonstrate a possible global standardization of operative processes, leading to the design of a near-zero-failure intelligent system that is able to learn and upgrade itself. Our new method provides guidance for selecting the new generation of intelligent manufacturing and smart systems in order to optimize human–machine interactions, with the related smart maintenance and education. © 2020 THE AUTHORS

ABSTRACT: The last 20 years have brought significant developments to digital fabrication technology, known as additive manufacturing (3D printing), and it has finally started to shed its prototyping mantel in favor of an industrial one. Yet its innovations are in danger of being subsumed into existing commercial practices, as society arguably continues to underestimate its ability, in conjunction with data collection, analysis, and communication tools, to disrupt current systems and enable a more equitable distribution of manufacturing wealth, capability, and capacity. This chapter highlights the potential of emerging industrial technologies to support a shift towards a more human-centered, responsible society where social and environmental problems are addressed through systems that maximises cyberspace and physical space integration, through the reframing of higher education engineering curriculum and pedagogy for manufacturing in Society 5.0. © 2021, IGI Global.

ABSTRACT: Technological advances have made possible industrial and commercial applications of artificial intelligence, virtual reality and highly integrated manufacturing systems. It has also freed business activity from a focus on place, as both work activities and markets have been able to harness information and communication technologies in order to operate remotely. As a result, researchers have highlighted a phenomenon of ‘smart’ working. Some have pointed to a fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) in which ‘smart’ factories use robotics to achieve high performance. There is now a suggestion of progress towards Industry 5.0, in which technological and social systems work in harmony to deliver personalised mass customization of products and services. This paper examines these developments from the perspective of unique, individual understandings of work roles and sustainability, posing the questions ‘Smart’ from whose point of view? Do smart systems promote sustainable organizations? How should design of smart systems be approached? It suggests that contemporary socio-technical systems approaches to organizational analysis are the best way to support harnessing of smart technologies in organizations. © 2019, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The paper aims to contribute to the characterization of the “sustainability Tsi–functions Fi–competitiveness Kis of sustainable products Pis” correlation, which is required to achieve sustainable progress in all organizations and workplaces/human action places {LM/A}, on unlimited term in “Society 5.0/Sustainable Society”. Morphological analysis is used to characterize the correlation “sustainability Tsi–functions Fi–competitiveness Kis of sustainable anthropic products Pis”. On this basis, in practice, one can construct: (1) the integrated profile (PIS) of sustainability Tis/of integrated quality Ti of the products Pi and (2) the profile (PSPI) of sustainability Tis/of integrated quality Ti of the improved products Pui for user/final consumer Su in target markets/segments/niches/crenels and all external environments. The PSPI profile is analysed in detail. Applying research results in practice helps to optimize the design, production, distribution, use/consumption, and circularity of sustainable products. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: For almost a decade now, production science has been dealing with Industry 4.0. In recent years, a large number of technological innovations have been developed and introduced into practice, enabling the implementation of smart and connected manufacturing systems. Over the next years, researchers and practitioners will face new challenges in Industry 4.0 to achieve the original vision of an intelligent and self-optimizing factory. We are currently at a crossroads between the first level of Industry 4.0, which was characterized by technologically driven innovations, and a future level of Industry 4.0+, which will be based on data-driven innovation. This article introduces these two phases of Industry 4.0 and gives a direction of research trends with growing attention in manufacturing science and practice. In the context of Industry 4.0+, two research directions, in particular, are expected to generate groundbreaking changes in production and its environment. This is, on the one hand, the introduction of Artificial Intelligence into manufacturing and on the other hand the use of nature as inspiration in the form of Biological Transformation. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

ABSTRACT: In today’s modern world, societies are utterly attached to internet and technologies to access more information, switching the traditional modes of communication to virtual – all at large scale simultaneously. Governments are using advanced innovative technologies to provide end-to-end integrated public services e.g. in the form of electronic government (e-Government); nevertheless, how effective and efficient their communication with public society are and where citizens engagement has been considered to deliver the services – these still remain unexplored. This developing paper is considering Industry 4.0 (I4.0), Society 5.0 (S5.0), sustainability and circular economy in order to review the impact of I4.0 on manufacturing, what various governments planned to adopt I4.0 technologies within public services and direct communication with citizens. Eventually introducing some of the opportunities, challenges and gaps within citizen’s electronic engagement (e-Engagement) which is a term of digital communication between citizens and public decision makers. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

ABSTRACT: In the XX century, arises the mass production implemented by Henry Ford to overcome the period of crisis lived in the World. In 1988, the term Lean emerged and this philosophy successfully challenged the mass production implemented in the automotive industry, focused on customers’ requirements and satisfaction with the minimum use of resources and waste elimination. A Lean environment can be a promoter in the implementation of the fourth industrial revolution, named Industry 4.0 (I4.0). In the succession of Industry 4.0 emerged the Society 5.0 in Japan, as a strategy to deal with the impact of an ageing population. The focus of this quiet revolution is the humankind and the creation of conditions to promote a happy, motivated and satisfied society with more time for leisure and consequently increase productivity and wealth. This article presents a historical approach to the technological evolution of productive systems, and their influence on societies. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: In this study, a new idea of production technologies with Society 5.0 is presented. The introduction and penetration of 5G network will bring a revolutionary technological advancement in production management. Previously, under the environment of the Industry 4.0 with 4G network, a factory faced limitation of the production management, especially in sharing large scale data. The weakness related to sharing Industrial Big Data under 4G environment will be wiped out thanks to the introduction of 5G. In this study, a theoretical vision is presented with an illustration of the comparison between an Industry 4.0 Cell Production Model and a new Society 5.0 Autonomous Distributed Agent Mechanism. © 2019 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Staying at the top is getting tougher and more challenging due to the fast-growing and changing digital technologies and AI-based solutions. The world of technology, mass customization, and advanced manufacturing is experiencing a rapid transformation. Robots are becoming even more important as they can now be coupled with the human mind by means of brain-machine interface and advances in artificial intelligence. A strong necessity to increase productivity while not removing human workers from the manufacturing industry is imposing punishing challenges on the global economy. To counter these challenges, this article introduces the concept of Industry 5.0, where robots are intertwined with the human brain and work as collaborator instead of competitor. This article also outlines a number of key features and concerns that every manufacturer may have about Industry 5.0. In addition, it presents several developments achieved by researchers for use in Industry 5.0 applications and environments. Finally, the impact of Industry 5.0 on the manufacturing industry and overall economy is discussed from an economic and productivity point of view, where it is argued that Industry 5.0 will create more jobs than it will take away. © 2019 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Digital technologies, autonomous systems, and artificial intelligence are seen as mater‑of‑course parts of the world today. Japan, as one of the leading countries in technological innovations, is the most advanced in terms of approach to digital society. Japanese society and government have been working on a new concept of life where all the digital technologies will communicate through the internet. Society organised in this way is called Society 5.0 – super Smart society. In Japan, this concept is centred about seventeen sustainable goals (United Nations, 2018). Society 5.0 is a reaction to the fundamental technological revolutionary changes known today as Industry 4.0. Thus, Society 5.0 is the consequence of a technological revolution that will eventually affect not just the production but all parts of today’s life as well. The new technologies evoke some fundamental philosophical and existential questions. How can technological advances improve the prosperity and functioning of society? What about the privacy and security of all the users? The present paper compares Japan and the Czech Republic from the perspective of digitalization of society based on three main aspects: government programs supporting digital technologies, number of technically educated experts and investments in science and research. The objective is to find out how much the Czech Republic has advanced towards preparations for digital society. © 2019 Mendel University of Agriculture and Forestry Brno. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: This article integrates the concept of leap frogging strategy and digitalization as a key strategy for the sustainability of logistics players in facing up with GIG economy. At present, business organization are moving towards Industry 5.0 (internet of thought) and GIG economy where the traditional way of fully relying on full time workers are no longer relevant. The world of work is changing. From organizational view, leap frogging strategy with technological advancement are significant to achieve competitive advantage to ensure the continuity of business. While from worker perspective, having technology driven talent is a must to face new business economy called as GIG economy. In other words, all workers in every industry including logistics should ensure they have technology driven talent in his/her portfolio to remain competitive in the working world. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the applicability of Industry 5.0 such as digitalization and mobile marketing to logistics players; to make them more visible to customer and competitor. Single case study method was adopted to study on the perspective as discussed above more in-depth. Findings from this single case study is transferable as it provides rich explanation and discussion from one of the earliest logistics company in Malaysia, with logistics experience almost five (5) decades in providing logistics services. The qualitative findings pointed out four key areas for LSP improvement. Firstly, all LSPs should go for transition process with their business model to provide them with new revenue - logistics digital business and allow them to be more visible to their customer by fully utilizing the promotion activities online. Secondly, every agreement with customer should be put into contract and it is paperless within system. Thirdly, digital payment is a must to all logistics players to practice in order for them to compete in digital era. Finally, and inevitability, to sustain in the business, logistics may move to become intelligent logistics players with carrying no asset and just focus on negotiating contracts with customers. This term refers to practising logistics players with no assets or less assets centric. In principle, the company does not own asset but able to provide logistics services (for example fleet and warehouses) by aggregating "information about assets" from people who do own them by leveraging on data. This article contributes to the logistics study by matching issue on digitalization and GIG economy in logistics sector. More work on future of logistics is needed with large sample across the globe in order to obtain more data to help the logistics players depict themselves in new economy. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.

ABSTRACT: In 2002, the Brazilian Chemical Society have promoted several activities aiming to prepare a document to discuss the education in Chemistry in Brazil, the new model of research funding, the area situation and its perspectives. The document drew up diagnoses and brought up proposals that were organized into six mobilizing axes. Among its conclusions it was expected an alignment of scientific and technological research, considering the central role of Chemistry in solving problems and overcoming challenges affecting the education, full citizenship, climate changes, food production and quality, access to and quality of water, energy security, preservation of ecosystems and species, emerging diseases and quality of life. The current moment brings again challenges, imposed by a new technological generation, the transformations of the urban societies and by the commitment with a sustainable development. This article seeks to outline a panorama, using as background the Industry 4.0, the Society 5.0, the Sustainable Development Objectives, the creation of the EMBRAPII, the SENAI Institutes of Innovation and the role of the graduate programs in Chemistry, in order to construct a new agenda under the scope of the SBQ for the next 15 years. © 2018 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.All Rights Reserved.
