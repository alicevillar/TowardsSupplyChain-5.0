Paradoxically, IoT technologies and paradigms such as edge computing, although they have a huge potential for the digital transition towards sustainability, they are not yet contributing to the sustainable development of the IoT sector itself. In fact, such a sector has a significant carbon footprint due to the use of scarce raw materials and its energy consumption in manufacturing, operating, and recycling processes. To tackle these issues, the Green IoT (G-IoT) paradigm has emerged as a research area to reduce such carbon footprint; however, its sustainable vision collides directly with the advent of Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI), which imposes the consumption of additional energy. This article deals with this problem by exploring the different aspects that impact the design and development of Edge-AI G-IoT systems. Moreover, it presents a practical Industry 5.0 use case that illustrates the different concepts analyzed throughout the article. Specifically, the proposed scenario consists in an Industry 5.0 smart workshop that looks for improving operator safety and operation tracking. Such an application case makes use of a mist computing architecture composed of AI-enabled IoT nodes. After describing the application case, it is evaluated its energy consumption and it is analyzed the impact on the carbon footprint that it may have on different countries.

The SSWM-related causal interrelationships within the proposed hierarchical structure, and critical barriers for the practical improvement and enhancement of SSWM performance are identified as preference enriching both literature and practices. In nature, the hierarchical structure is with the causal interrelationships under uncertainties. The perspective empowers the creation of a new biosphere based on technological progress, but in the sustainable solid waste management field, it is difficult to encounter and shape the systematized processes due to barriers and challenges. To address this shortcoming, this study evaluates the technical challenges faced in the field of sustainable solid waste management toward society 5.0. The valid attributes are usually described the qualitative information. The fuzzy Delphi method is applied to acquire the valid and reliable attributes. Fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory experiment is to visualize the causal interrelationships among the attributes. Choquet integral with respect to the nonadditive attributes over the valid set provides an overall perspective function. The results establish an understanding of sustainable solid waste management barriers in the perspectives under uncertainties. Community uncertainty, policy and regulation problems, city architecture, and technology interaction are the factors that influence sustainable performance. In practices, (1) diverse disciplines and sectors in local, national, and global communities; (2) a lack of mobility and reliability; (3) mass production and mass consumption; (4) an insufficient level of artificial intelligence application; and (5) failures related to data management and security hinder the improvement of sustainable solid waste management toward society 5.0.

Despite technological support, these pests have caused 20% to 40% production losses, a 50% to 60% deficit in performance, and a cost of between USD 70 million and USD 220 million to the world economies, which forces us to rethink actions centered on people as the key elements to develop appropriate solutions. For this, the present study presents a technological proposal centered on small indigenous coffee producer requirements for introducing Industry 5.0 technologies, considering roadmapping, knowledge management, statistical analysis, and the social, productive, and digital contexts of five localities in Mexico. The results show a correlation between monitoring and control, soil analysis, the creation of organic fertilizers, accompaniment, and coffee experimentation, as the actions to be implemented, proposing the introduction of a mobile application; sensors, virtual platforms, dome-shaped greenhouses, and spectrophotometric technology as relevant technologies centered on indigenous coffee producers' requirements.

The board is based on the low power, 8-bit, ATtiny20-CCU Microchip AVR microcontroller. The ATtiny20-CCU can be programmed without bootloader, using the Atmel Tiny Programming Interface (TPI), instead of In-System Programming (ISP). The C code used to program the microcontroller can be written and compiled using the Microchip Studio freeware platform. The ATtiny20-CCU Ultra Fine-pitch Ball Grid Array (UFBGA) packaging technology allows the shrinkage of the conceived Electroless Nickel-Immersion Gold (ENIG) Printed Circuit Board (PCB) to a size of only 15.5 × 13 mm. Its low cost also makes it a viable option for developing many educational electronic projects, especially for Instrumentation and Assistive Technology.

The IoT builds on (1) broadband wireless internet connectivity, (2) miniaturized sensors embedded in animate and inanimate objects ranging from the house cat to the milk carton in your smart fridge, and (3) AI and cobots making sense of Big Data collected by sensors. Industry 4.0 is a high-tech strategy for manufacturing automation that employs the IoT, thus creating the Smart Factory. Extreme automation until ""everything is connected to everything else"" poses, however, vulnerabilities that have been little considered to date. First, highly integrated systems are vulnerable to systemic risks such as total network collapse in the event of failure of one of its parts, for example, by hacking or Internet viruses that can fully invade integrated systems. Second, extreme connectivity creates new social and political power structures. If left unchecked, they might lead to authoritarian governance by one person in total control of network power, directly or through her/his connected surrogates. We propose Industry 5.0 that can democratize knowledge coproduction from Big Data, building on the new concept of symmetrical innovation. Industry 5.0 utilizes IoT, but differs from predecessor automation systems by having three-dimensional (3D) symmetry in innovation ecosystem design: (1) a built-in safe exit strategy in case of demise of hyperconnected entrenched digital knowledge networks. Importantly, such safe exists are orthogonal-in that they allow ""digital detox"" by employing pathways unrelated/unaffected by automated networks, for example, electronic patient records versus material/article trails on vital medical information; (2) equal emphasis on both acceleration and deceleration of innovation if diminishing returns become apparent; and (3) next generation social science and humanities (SSH) research for global governance of emerging technologies: ""Post-ELSI Technology Evaluation Research"" (PETER). Importantly, PETER considers the technology opportunity costs, ethics, ethics-of-ethics, framings (epistemology), independence, and reflexivity of SSH research in technology policymaking.

Currently, although some scholars have examined the research trends in the field of smart factories, we have not found any research on the analysis of the knowledge output of relevant organizations among smart factories. An urgent problem is whether cooperation between organizations with different characteristics will affect the overall development of intelligent factories. This study aimed to perform a comprehensive analysis of the knowledge content and structure of a smart factory and the characteristics of its knowledge production structure. We also evaluated whether the triple helix structure was stable, and whether the research topics of different issues were similar. The triple helix model was used to study three aspects of the knowledge structure of a smart factory: university, government, and industry. Furthermore, the research contents of different organizations were analyzed in detail using network analysis. It was found that research funding at the national level leads to a knowledge spillover effect. After 2015, a triple helix knowledge structure was formed in the field of smart factories, which maintained a certain stability until 2020. The output of triple helix cooperation research has a significant impact. University research focuses more extensively and intensively on technology, government research on macro aspects, and Industry 5.0 has become a hotspot in industry research.

It is widely accepted that the advent of robotics and automation in previous industrial revolutions brought about paradigm shifts in the manufacturing industry worldwide. It is therefore conceivable that the fifth industrial revolution will bring about a similar shift in norms and make fundamental changes in our approach to industry and manufacturing. From the first industrial revolution to the fourth, science and technological innovations, training and capital, were the key elements in evolving how products are conceived, designed and manufactured. Looking forward to the fifth industrial revolution it is likely that there will be a paradigm change in how industry will evolve given the tools of industry 4.0; the internet of things, digitization, blockchain, advanced materials, additive manufacture, artificial intelligence and robotics, drones, energy technology, biotechnology, neurotechnology and virtual and augmented reality.",,Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering,Proceedings of the International Symposium for Production Research 2019,,2019-10-25,2019,2019-10-25,2020,,,432-441,Closed,Chapter,"Doyle-Kent, Mary; Kopacek, Peter","Doyle-Kent, Mary (Department of Engineering Technology, Waterford Institute of Technology, Waterford, Ireland); Kopacek, Peter (Department of Mechanical Engineering and Management, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria)","Doyle-Kent, Mary (Waterford Institute of Technology)","Doyle-Kent, Mary (Waterford Institute of Technology); Kopacek, Peter (TU Wien)",29,23,,10.08,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1122090470,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

A systematic literature review method was used to get evidence from the current knowledge linked to this theme. The results have evidenced a strong gap related to Industry 5.0 approaches for the supply chain field. Forty-one (41) publications, including conference and journal papers, have been found in the literature. Nineteen (19) words, which were grouped in four (4) clusters, have been identified in the data analysis. This was the basis to form the four (4) constructs of Industry 5.0: Industry Strategy, Innovation and Technologies, Society and Sustainability, and Transition Issues. Then, an alignment with the supply chain context was proposed, being the basis for the incipient Supply Chain 5.0 framework and its research agenda. Industry 5.0 is still in an embryonic and ideal stage. The literature is scarce and many other concepts and discoveries are going to emerge. Although this literature review is based on few available sources, it provides insightful and novel concepts related to Industry 5.0 in the supply chain context. Moreover, it presents a clear set of constructs and a structured research agenda to encourage researchers in deploying further conceptual and empirical works linked to the subject herein explored. Organizations’ leadership, policymakers, and other practitioners involved in supply chains, and mainly those currently working with Industry 4.0 initiatives, can benefit from this research by having clear guidance regarding the dimensions needed to structurally design and implement an Industry 5.0 strategy. This article adds valuable insights to researchers and practitioners, by approaching the newest and revolutionary concept of the Industry 5.0 phenomenon in the supply chain context, which is still an unexplored theme.",,Logistics,,,2021-07-09,2021,2021-07-09,,5,3,49,All OA; Gold,Article,"Frederico, Guilherme F.","Frederico, Guilherme F.

The development of wettable peatland products and services (termed 'Paludiculture') present significant opportunities for enabling a transition away from peat-harvesting (fossil fuels) to developing 'green' eco-innovations. However, this must be balanced with sustainable carbon sequestration and environmental protection. This complex transition from 'brown to green' must be met in real time by enabling digital technologies across the full value chain. This will potentially necessitate creation of new green-business models with the potential to support disruptive innovation. This timely paper describes digital transformation of paludiculture-based eco-innovation that will potentially lead to a paradigm shift towards using smart digital technologies to address efficiency of products and services along with future-proofing for climate change. Digital transform of paludiculture also aligns with the 'Industry 5.0 - a human-centric solution'. However, companies supporting peatland innovation may lack necessary standards, data-sharing or capabilities that can also affect viable business model propositions that can jeopardize economic, political and social sustainability. Digital solutions may reduce costs, increase productivity, improve produce develop, and achieve faster time to market for paludiculture. Digitisation also enables information systems to be open, interoperable, and user-friendly. This constitutes the first study to describe the digital transformation of paludiculture, both vertically and horizontally, in order to inform sustainability that includes process automation via AI, machine learning, IoT-Cloud informed sensors and robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and blockchain for cyber-physical systems. Thus, the aim of this paper is to describe the applicability of digital transformation to actualize the benefits and opportunities of paludiculture activities and enterprises in the Irish midlands with a global orientation.",,The Science of The Total Environment,,Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Humans; Industry; Soil,2022-05-29,2022,2022-05-29,2022-09,838,Pt 3,156328,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Rowan, Neil J; Murray, Niall; Qiao, Yuansong; O'Neill, E; Clifford, Eoghan; Barceló, Damià; Power, Deborah M","Rowan, Neil J (Bioscience Research Institute, Technological University of the Shannon Midlands Midwest (TUS), Dublin Road, Athlone, Ireland; Empower Eco™ Sustainable Hub, Technological University of the Shannon Midlands Midwest (TUS), Dublin Road, Athlone, Ireland.

Concretely, the milestone set for Industry 4.0 was to improve the sustainability and efficiency of production systems. By extension, the emphasis was focused on both the digitization and the digitalization of systems, providing room for further improvement. However, the current technological evolution is more system/machine-oriented, rather than human-oriented. Thus, several countries have begun orchestrating initiatives towards the design and development of the human-centric aspect of technologies, systems, and services, which has been coined as Industry 5.0. The impact of Industry 5.0 will extend to societal transformation, which eventually leads to the generation of a new society, the Society 5.0. The developments will be focused on the social and human-centric aspect of the tools and technologies introduced under the framework of Industry 4.0. Therefore, sustainability and human well-being will be at the heart of what comes next, the Industry 5.0, as a subset of Society 5.0. Industry 5.0 will build on the foundations laid during Industry 4.0 by emphasizing human-centered, resilient, and sustainable design. Consequently, the authors in this research work, through a critical literature review, aim to provide adequate reasoning for considering Industry 5.0 as a framework for enabling the coexistence of industry and emerging societal trends and needs.

Industry 5.0 make use of collaborative robots (cobots) for optimizing productivity and ensuring safety. At the same time, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are predicted to be the main part of industry 5.0 in the forthcoming days. Regardless of high mobility and energy-limited UAVs for wireless communication as significant advantages, different issues are also existing in the UAV networks, such as security, reliability, etc. Several research works have focused on resolving security issues in UAV communication to support safety-critical applications. With this motivation, this article presents an artificial intelligence-based UAV-borne secure communication with classification (AIUAV-SCC) framework for industry 5.0 environment. The proposed AIUAV-SCC model involves two major phases namely image steganography-based secure communication and deep learning (DL)-based classification. At the initial stage, a new image steganography technique with multilevel discrete wavelet transformation, quantum bacterial colony optimization based optimal pixel selection, and encryption processes take place.

METHODS: In this retrospective single-centre study, we analysed 49,553 h of air leakage after anatomical lung resection in 714 patients between 2018 and 2020. The transition of mean IPP and mean air leak flow was monitored using DCS, and the association between mean IPP and mean air leak flow was examined. The relationship between the transition of mean IPP and air leakage according to the varying suction pressures on DCS was also investigated.
RESULTS: Overall, 272 patients (38.1%) showed air leakage after surgery. The mean IPP in patients without air leakage was -12.0 ± 2.9 cmH2O and maintained at about -12 cmH2O constantly, while the mean IPP in patients with air leakage was -8.3 ± 1.9 cmH2O, which changed to -12 cmH2O instantly if air leakage disappeared (P < 0.001). Among patients with air leakage, the mean IPP changed more distinctly in patients with mild suction management than in those with conventional suction management (-5.0 ± 2.6 to -11.5 ± 4.2 and -8.8 ± 1.3 to -12.1 ± 2.5 cmH2O, respectively; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The change in IPP on a DCS is useful for detecting air leakage. Furthermore, management with a mild suction setting on DCS makes it easy to recognize the disappearance of postoperative air leakage.",The authors gratefully acknowledge their contribution to data collection and the efforts of past and present members of their department.,Interactive Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery,,Chest Tubes; Humans; Lung; Pneumonectomy; Retrospective Studies; Suction,2021-05-17,2021,2021-05-17,2021-10-04,33,4,ivab122-,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Eriguchi, Daisuke; Ito, Hiroyuki; Nagashima, Takuya; Adachi, Hiroyuki; Samejima, Joji; Nemoto, Daiji; Nakayama, Haruhiko; Ikeda, Norihiko","Eriguchi, Daisuke (Department of Thoracic Surgery, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan; Department of Thoracic Surgery, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan); Ito, Hiroyuki (Department of Thoracic Surgery, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan); Nagashima, Takuya (Department of Thoracic Surgery, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan); Adachi, Hiroyuki (Department of Thoracic Surgery, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan); Samejima, Joji (Department of Thoracic Surgery, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan); Nemoto, Daiji (Department of Thoracic Surgery, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan); Nakayama, Haruhiko (Department of Thoracic Surgery, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan); Ikeda, Norihiko (Department of Thoracic Surgery, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan)",,"Eriguchi, Daisuke (Kanagawa Prefectural Hospital Organization; Tokyo Medical University); Ito, Hiroyuki (Kanagawa Prefectural Hospital Organization); Nagashima, Takuya (Kanagawa Prefectural Hospital Organization); Adachi, Hiroyuki (Kanagawa Prefectural Hospital Organization); Samejima, Joji (Kanagawa Prefectural Hospital Organization); Nemoto, Daiji (Kanagawa Prefectural Hospital Organization); Nakayama, Haruhiko (Kanagawa Prefectural Hospital Organization); Ikeda, Norihiko (Tokyo Medical University)",0,0,,,https://academic.oup.com/icvts/article-pdf/33/4/580/42781420/ivab122.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137051635,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

A resilient manufacturing strategy based on the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks plays an essential role in facilitating production and supply chain recovery. IIoT contains confidential data and private information, and many security issues arise through vulnerabilities in the infrastructure. The traditional centralized IIoT framework is not only of high cost for system configuration but also vulnerable to cyber-attacks and single-point failure, which is not suitable for achieving the resilient manufacturing vision in Industry 5.0. Recently, researchers are seeking a secure solution of middleware based on blockchain technology integration for decentralized IIoT, which can effectively protect the consistency, integrity, and availability of IIoT data by utilizing the auditing and tamper-proof features of the blockchain. This paper presented a review of secure blockchain middleware for decentralized IIoT towards Industry 5.0. Firstly, the security issues of conventional IIoT solutions and the advantages of blockchain middleware are analyzed. Secondly, an architecture of secure blockchain middleware for decentralized IIoT is proposed. Finally, enabling technologies, challenges, and future directions are reviewed. The innovation of this paper is to study and discuss the distributed blockchain middleware, investigating its ability to eliminate the risk of a single point of failure via a distributed feature in the context of resilient manufacturing in Industry 5.0 and to solve the security issues from traditional centralized IIoT. Also, the four-layer architecture of blockchain middleware presented based on the IIoT application framework is a novel aspect of this review. It is expected that the paper lays a solid foundation for making IIoT blockchain middleware a new venue for Industry 5.0 research.",,Machines,,,2022-09-26,2022,2022-09-26,,10,10,858,All OA; Gold,Article,"Leng, Jiewu; Chen, Ziying; Huang, Zhiqiang; Zhu, Xiaofeng; Su, Hongye; Lin, Zisheng; Zhang, Ding","Leng, Jiewu (); Chen, Ziying (); Huang, Zhiqiang (); Zhu, Xiaofeng (); Su, Hongye (); Lin, Zisheng (); Zhang, Ding ()",,"Leng, Jiewu (); Chen, Ziying (); Huang, Zhiqiang (); Zhu, Xiaofeng (); Su, Hongye (); Lin, Zisheng (); Zhang, Ding ()",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1702/10/10/858/pdf?version=1664197399,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151433129,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Its efficient functioning depends on the implementation of SDG activities and the development of industry (first-fourth/fifth industrial revolution). Due to the likelihood of different priorities in the implementation of the sustainable development goals, it is important to build such relationships, e.g. in the supply chain, so that their implementation could take place under similar conditions. Digitization, or the circular economy concept (CE), create an opportunity for the SME sector to build relationships as part of industry networks, for instance, where the managed supply chain would have a common and realistic goal to achieve. This goal will be a priority in business models based on sustainable development. The article presents the results of research regarding the furniture industry in Poland (key industry, referred to as smart specialization). The results of the analysis show that the industry has a large production potential, and the natural resources used in it are constantly increasing. However, there are doubts raised by the lack of stability in the dynamics of the sold production in the industry.

Although industry 5.0 can revolutionize the landscape of goods production, still its adoption is in the infancy stage. Hence, the purpose of this article is to examine barriers that impede the adoption of industry 5.0, and to propose solution initiatives (SIs). After an in-depth literature review and interviews with German industry experts in pharmaceutical sector, barriers and SIs are ranked using an integrated Analytical hierarchy process-elimination and choice expressing reality-decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (AHP-ELECTRE-DEMATEL) approach. “Linking virtual reality and reality” is found to be the most critical deterrent to the adoption of industry 5.0, and falls into a causal group, which signifies their influence on other deterrents. “Measures for better connectivity with patients” is of utmost importance for German firms to ensure secure communication and safeguard patient data. The findings also highlight the problems with the adoption of high-tech innovations due to lack of standardization and fair benchmarking policies on industry 5.0. This article concludes by proposing an industry 5.0 framework. The inhibitors to adopting industry 5.0 were investigated in this article, the results of which will assist practitioners and decision makers to understand the issues with industry 5.0. The results of this article will help potential adopters of this technology to look for the SIs.

Physical objects are interconnected to perform real-time monitoring and decision support through cyber-physical systems. Besides machine-to-machine communications, humans play an essential role in IoT-empowered supply chain operations to monitor and configure IoT devices and interact with IoT systems for enhanced industrial intelligence. Extended reality (XR) technologies are exploited for immersive visualisation to strengthen the connectivity between human and cyber-physical systems. However, the role and development of XR in the IoT-empowered supply chain scenarios are not revealed. Therefore, this article attempts to introduce readers to the latest XR technologies and summarise significant research opportunities/challenges raised by the current literature to facilitate further interest in this topic. The systematic literature review process analysed 71 research articles from 1,207 relevant publications using text mining models, including the bag of words (BoW) and LexRank algorithms.

In recent years, a large number of technological innovations have been developed and introduced into practice, enabling the implementation of smart and connected manufacturing systems. Over the next years, researchers and practitioners will face new challenges in Industry 4.0 to achieve the original vision of an intelligent and self-optimizing factory. We are currently at a crossroads between the first level of Industry 4.0, which was characterized by technologically driven innovations, and a future level of Industry 4.0+, which will be based on data-driven innovation. This article introduces these two phases of Industry 4.0 and gives a direction of research trends with growing attention in manufacturing science and practice. In the context of Industry 4.0+, two research directions, in particular, are expected to generate groundbreaking changes in production and its environment.

Digital twin (DT), referring to the virtual representation of a physical object, is well-perceived as a key driver in the development of PI-based Supply Chain Management (SCM). Due to the capabilities of real-time monitoring and evaluation of large-scale complex systems, significant research efforts have been made to exploit values of PI/DT in SCM. Despite this, the current literature remained largely unstructured and scattered due to a lack of systematic literature reviews to synergise research findings, analyse the evolution of research fronts and extract emerging trends in the field. To address this issue, the paper deploys a bibliometric knowledge mapping approach to provide a bird's eye view of the current research status in the PI/DT-SCM area. Using CiteSpace's keyword co-occurrence network, 518 journal articles are clustered into 10 key research streams on PI/DT applications in: job shop scheduling, smart manufacturing design, PI-based SCM, manufacturing virtualisation, information management, sustainability development, data analytics, manufacturing operations management, simulation and optimisation, and assembly process planning. Based on citation burst rate, keywords representing research frontiers of the PI/DT are detected and their temporal evolutions are discussed. Likewise, some identified emerging research trends are production process and system, robotics, computer architecture, and cost. Finally, seven future research directions are suggested, which emphasise on several PI/DT-related issues, including business ecosystem, sustainability development, SC downstream management, cognitive thinking in Industry 5.0, citizen twin in digital society, and SC resilience.",,International Journal of Production Economics,,,2022-02,2022,,2022-02,244,,108381,All OA; Green,Article,"Nguyen, Tiep; Duong, Quang Huy; Van Nguyen, Truong; Zhu, You; Zhou, Li","Nguyen, Tiep (Business School, University of Greenwich, London, SE10 9LS, UK); Duong, Quang Huy (Business School, University of Greenwich, London, SE10 9LS, UK); Van Nguyen, Truong (Business School, Brunel University London, Uxbridge, UB8 3PH, UK); Zhu, You (College of Business Administration, Hunan University, Changsha, 410082, China); Zhou, Li (Business School, University of Greenwich, London, SE10 9LS, UK)","Zhu, You (Hunan University)","Nguyen, Tiep (University of Greenwich); Duong, Quang Huy (University of Greenwich); Van Nguyen, Truong (Brunel University London); Zhu, You (Hunan University); Zhou, Li (University of Greenwich)",8,8,,,http://gala.gre.ac.uk/id/eprint/34545/3/34545_ZHOU_%20Knowledge_mapping_of_digital_twin.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143626769,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems","9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Industrial equipment such as sensors, controllers, and others are expensive, and upgrading manufacturing equipment in existing facilities is costly. The growing use of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven cost reductions in sensors, controllers, and communications through high volumes of digital devices and value-added components. The manufacturing sector with its massive installed base of legacy equipment has also become an area of interest for the advances in innovative digital technologies. Meanwhile, the next level of innovation in manufacturing has been achieved, labeled by the term 4th Industrial Revolution, in short Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 takes the automation of manufacturing processes to a new level by introducing customized and intelligent production technologies. Machines are connected and communicate with each other to ultimately make decisions, operate independently, or cooperate with humans in a customer-oriented production environment. This raises the question about the key issues of the next industrial enhancement and the term to call it? The change from Industry 4.0 to the next innovative industrial enhancement is termed Industry 5.0. However, Industry 5.0 has its root in the concept of Industry 4.0. Thus, the key issues of the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 can be seen in the goal of making manufacturability sustainable from economic, ecologic and societal perspectives. This requires building a circular economy with a focus on a human centric industry.

This implies that for an innovation system to be a Quadruple and Quintuple Helix Innovation System, the government and the political system, addressing the innovation system, must be democratic in substance, and not only in form. This indicates how a Quadruple and Quintuple Helix differs from Triple Helix approaches to innovation.

In modern manufacturing, system data are collected both from the field through sensors and by exploiting complex simulations. Data analysis techniques became crucial to build and maintain any efficient production line, while autonomous systems and robots are the main focus of researchers and practitioners. This pervasive use of artificial intelligence derived technologies pushed humans to the border of production systems. Industry 5.0 aims at bringing the attention back to humans in production lines while magnifying their interactions with intelligent systems. This new trend will impact the design of future manufacturing infrastructures, increasing their complexity. Engineers will need modeling and developing tools able to capture this complexity.

The main prerequisites for the emergence of the Industry 5.0 concept are studied, in particular, extensive digitization and the dynamic development of technologies of the fourth industrial revolution, which has led to the certain dehumanization of industry and has increased the interest of the scientific community in the aspects of industrial humanization, human-centeredness of industry, stability, sustainability, and resilience. The main principles and trends of the development of Industry 5.0, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, geopolitical crises, and disruptions of the global value chains on the condition and prospects for the development of world industry, new rules and requirements for global product manufacturers, technological innovations, and production trends are studied. The author identifies directions for expanding the concept of Industry 4.0 to include humanization, sustainability, and resilience. The rapid development of new technologies often outpaces the ability of organizations to align their development priorities with it and effectively take advantage of new opportunities, which leads to the need to navigate the changing business environment in time and develop a relevant development strategy. With so many technological changes, changing workforce demands, and social and regulatory priorities, there is a need to define guiding principles to help set the course for the digital industry. Industry 5.0 has become the basis for revising the future of energy, manufacturing, and mobility of supply chains, which rest on the foundations laid by Industry 4.0. The weaknesses of the Industry 4.0 concept, especially in terms of the role of a human in ""smart"" production and ensuring sustainable development are outlined. Accordingly, the expediency of further research and implementation of the Industry 5.0 concept is substantiated. On the basis of the conducted research on the implementation of Industry 5.0 and the world trends of industrial development, the author justifies the feasibility of reorienting production and business activities to human-centeredness as a new norm, strengthening sustainability, in particular, careful planning of stabilization measures in case of disruption of the global value chains – from factory facilities to network supplier, to transport channels, to regulatory and geopolitical changes, ensuring sustainability with manufacturers rethinking their impact on natural resources in connection with the expansion of the regulatory and legislative framework and investors' attention to reducing carbon emissions and negative impact on the environment.",,Socio-Economic Problems of the Modern Period of Ukraine,,,2022,2022,,2022,,3(155),41-46,Closed,Article,"Ryvak, Nataliya O.","Ryvak, Nataliya O.

One of the main reasons is the increased number of variables, parameters, and interrelations on the shop floor. This intrinsic complexity can grow exponentially when considering the manufacture of large-size products with high levels of variability and variants: the mass production of large recreational motorboats with high levels of customization and low production volumes, mass customization. With the increasing role of sustainability and concepts of Industry 5.0, focusing not just on improving production systems but also human wellbeing, quick decision making becomes essential. Data and digitalization are becoming the cornerstone for system improvement, and digital data availability and analysis can facilitate the utilization of computerized tools to support decision making and maximize the performance of complex systems. For that purpose, simulation can be a powerful analytical tool to design, maintain, and improve complex manufacturing systems. Simulation techniques usually allow handling the size and complexity commonly associated with manufacturing systems. However, in systems with highly customized and large-size products, manual processes, and limited floor space, the implementation of simulation techniques is not straightforward, especially considering the aspects of variability, data collection, model validation, and system reconfiguration. With a particular focus on large-size products and limitations of a constrained existing facility layout, this paper presents the implementation of a simulation-based reconfiguration assessment considering manual production, assembly, and internal logistics requirements. Going through an industrial case study of large recreational motorboats manufacturing, the paper analyses the system analysis, data collection, implementation, and validation of the methodology step by step. Considering different what-if scenarios, the focus is on the capacity reconfiguration using Discrete-Event Simulation. The results can serve as a guideline for decision-makers and stakeholders working with complex mass customization manufacturing systems and space-constrained facility layouts.",,Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering,SPS2022,,2022-04-20,2022,2022-04-20,,,,,All OA; Gold,Chapter,"Ruiz Zúñiga, Enrique; Barrera Diaz, Carlos Alberto; Del Riego Navarro, Andrés; Ng, Amos H.

Several studies discuss the impacts of disruptive technologies on smart logistics operations in Industry 4.0. However, since Industry 5.0 is a new concept and still in its infancy, its implications for smart logistics have not been discussed. Methods: To fill this gap, this paper presents a comparative bibliometric analysis to show the connection and differences between Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0 and their implications for smart logistics.

Regular instances of fraudulent acts reveal a lack of openness in agriculture supply chains, raising worries about financial losses, eroding customer trust, and lowering corporate brand value. To develop an efficient and reliable trading environment, several fundamental modifications in the present supply chain architecture are required. There is broad consensus that blockchain can improve transparency in agriculture-food supply chains (agri-food SCs). Consumers now demand safe, sustainable, and equitable food production processes, and businesses are using blockchains and the internet of things to meet these needs. For enhanced responsiveness in agri-food SCs, new concepts have evolved that combine blockchains with various Industry 5.0 technologies (e.g., blockchain technology, big data, internet of things (IoT), radio frequency identification (RFID), near field communication (NFC), etc.). It is critical to cut through the hype and examine the technology’s limits, which might stymie its acceptance, implementation, and scalability in agri-food supply chains. This study presents Agri-SCM-BIoT (Agriculture Supply Chain Management using Blockchain and Internet of things) architecture to address the storage and scalability optimization, interoperability, security and privacy issues security, and privacy of personal data along with storage concerns with present single-chain agriculture supply chain systems.

This paper explores how data-driven decision-making (DDDM) can enable sustainable and resilient supply chain operations within the manufacturing industry. A series of in-depth interviews were conducted with experts, researchers, and company representatives across the manufacturing industry and universities in Sweden. The findings show a consensus among companies, researchers, and literature about the potential of data utilization for sustainability purposes; however, in most cases, the complete transformation towards data-driven has not happened yet. Companies have uncertainty about what data is needed rather than its lack. Reliability & validity of data become essential to exploit the potential of the data organizations already possess. Based on the literature and interview data, a conceptual model is proposed, including three identified parameters connected to DDDM, 1) data and IT infrastructure, 2) current operations, and 3) an improved triple bottom line performance. The model captures the interconnections between such parameters, depicting the benefits and challenges of DDDM and its relation to more sustainable and resilient supply chain operations within the manufacturing industry.

Robots are becoming even more important as they can now be coupled with the human mind by means of brain–machine interface and advances in artificial intelligence. A strong necessity to increase productivity while not removing human workers from the manufacturing industry is imposing punishing challenges on the global economy. To counter these challenges, this article introduces the concept of Industry 5.0, where robots are intertwined with the human brain and work as collaborator instead of competitor. This article also outlines a number of key features and concerns that every manufacturer may have about Industry 5.0. In addition, it presents several developments achieved by researchers for use in Industry 5.0 applications and environments. Finally, the impact of Industry 5.0 on the manufacturing industry and overall economy is discussed from an economic and productivity point of view, where it is argued that Industry 5.0 will create more jobs than it will take away.",,Sustainability,,,2019-08-13,2019,2019-08-13,,11,16,4371,All OA; Gold,Article,"Nahavandi, Saeid","Nahavandi, Saeid ()",,"Nahavandi, Saeid ()",237,204,,82.39,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/16/4371/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120313005,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,"8 Decent Work and Economic Growth; 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Logistics form an essential part of the CSC in terms of costs and project management. In turn, transportation accounts for more than half the logistics costs due to construction materials being low-cost/high-volume, and most other logistics processes being business processes and not physical ones. Construction transport is almost entirely road bound, one of the least sustainable modes with externalities far out of proportion to its numbers. Ergo, its optimisation presents substantial greening (de-carbonisation) opportunity, with potentially far-reaching sustainability impacts. The ASI (Avoid-Shift-Improve) concept considers activity, modal structure, and energy intensity/efficiency as transport carbon components, providing a fundamental optimisation framework. 93% of New Zealand’s freight (a third of it construction related) is road bound, with 99% fossil-fuel (diesel) dependence. Government adoption of ASI elements viz Supply Chain (SC) efficiency, transport optimisation, data/information sharing, and collaboration for transport decarbonisation aligns with Industry 5.0, but seeks further research for concrete implementation pathways. This paper aims to bridge the gap by proposing a research framework for greening of construction transport as a sustainability enabler for New Zealand.",,Frontiers in Built Environment,,,2022-05-25,2022,2022-05-25,,8,,871958,All OA; Gold,Article,"Dhawan, Kamal; Tookey, John E.; GhaffarianHoseini, Ali; GhaffarianHoseini, Amirhosein","Dhawan, Kamal (School of Future Environments, Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand); Tookey, John E.

1145,pub.1150022503,10.1016/j.spc.2022.08.003,,,Identifying industry 5.0 contributions to sustainable development: A strategy roadmap for delivering sustainability values,"Scholars believe that the newly introduced Industry 5.0 has the potential to move beyond the profit-centered productivity of Industry 4.0 and to promote sustainable development goals such as human-centricity, socio-environmental sustainability, and resilience. However, little has been done to understand how this ill-defined phenomenon may deliver its indented sustainability values despite these speculative promises. To address this knowledge gap, the present study developed a strategy roadmap that explains the mechanism by which Industry 5.0 delivers its intended sustainable development functions. The study first developed and introduced the Industry 5.0 reference model that describes the technical and functional properties of this phenomenon. The study further conducted a content-centric synthesis of the literature and identified the sustainable development functions of Industry 5.0. Next, the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique was employed to identify the sequential relationships among the functions and construct the Industry 5.0-enabled model of sustainable development. The ISM involved collecting the opinions of 11 Industry 5.0 experts through expert panel meetings. Results revealed that Industry 5.0 delivers sustainable development values through 16 functions. Circular intelligent products, employee technical assistance, intelligent automation, open sustainable innovation, renewable integration, and supply chain adaptability are examples of the functions identified. These functions are highly interrelated and should be developed in a specific order so that the synergies and complementarities among them would maximize the sustainable development value gains. The roadmap to Industry 5.0-driven sustainability developed in this study is expected to provide a better understanding of ways Industry 5.0 can contribute to sustainable development, explaining how the development of its functions should be managed to maximize their synergies and contribution to the intended sustainability values. The study also highlights important avenues for future research, emphasizing the potential enablers of Industry 5.0 development, such as Government 5.0 or Corporate Governance 5.0.",This research has been a part of a project that received funding from the European Union&#x27;s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 810318.,Sustainable Production and Consumption,,,2022-09,2022,,2022-09,33,,716-737,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Ghobakhloo, Morteza; Iranmanesh, Mohammad; Mubarak, Muhammad Faraz; Mubarik, Mobashar; Rejeb, Abderahman; Nilashi, Mehrbakhsh","Ghobakhloo, Morteza (School of Economics and Business, Kaunas University of Technology, Kaunas, Lithuania); Iranmanesh, Mohammad (School of Business and Law, Edith Cowan University, Joondalup, WA 6027, Australia); Mubarak, Muhammad Faraz (School of Economics and Business, Kaunas University of Technology, Kaunas, Lithuania); Mubarik, Mobashar (Faculty of Technology Management and Business, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Malaysia); Rejeb, Abderahman (Department of Management and Law, Faculty of Economics, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Via Columbia, 2, Rome 00133, Italy); Nilashi, Mehrbakhsh (UCSI Graduate Business School, UCSI University, No. 1 Jalan Menara Gading, UCSI Heights, 56000 Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Centre for Global Sustainability Studies (CGSS), Universiti Sains Malaysia, 11800, USM Penang, Malaysia)","Ghobakhloo, Morteza (Kaunas University of Technology)","Ghobakhloo, Morteza (Kaunas University of Technology); Iranmanesh, Mohammad (Edith Cowan University); Mubarak, Muhammad Faraz (Kaunas University of Technology); Mubarik, Mobashar (Tun Hussein Onn University of Malaysia); Rejeb, Abderahman (University of Rome Tor Vergata); Nilashi, Mehrbakhsh (UCSI University; Universiti Sains Malaysia)",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2022.08.003,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150022503,41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management; 44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,"12 Responsible Consumption and Production; 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

These technologies improve working conditions, create new business models, and increase both productivity and firm quality production. However, they can also improve life and society as a whole. This new perspective, oriented toward social and global well-being, is called Society 5.0. As has happened for all past industrial revolutions, Industry 4.0 will support the transition to a different society, i.e., Society 5.0. In this transition, open innovation and value co-creation can play an important role. The aim of the study was twofold: to examine how Industry 4.0 features and enabling technologies can support the transition to Society 5.0 and to investigate the roles of both open innovation and value co-creation within this transition. A conceptual framework was developed to jointly consider for the first time Industry 4.0, Society 5.0, open innovation, and value co-creation, which are all challenging issues that firms must cope with nowadays. Managers could profit from these insights to design ad hoc strategies in order to benefit from the opportunities emerging from this transition and overcome the main related challenges.","The authors would like to greatly thank the editors for their support and reviewers for their thoughtful and really interesting suggestions and comments, which have been extremely useful for enhancing this paper.",Sustainability,,,2020-10-28,2020,2020-10-28,,12,21,8943,All OA; Gold,Article,"Aquilani, Barbara; Piccarozzi, Michela; Abbate, Tindara; Codini, Anna","Aquilani, Barbara (Department of Economics, Engineering, Society and Business Organization (DEIM), 47, Via del Paradiso, University of ‘Tuscia’, 01100 Viterbo, Italy;, b.aquilani@unitus.it); Piccarozzi, Michela (Department of Economics, Engineering, Society and Business Organization (DEIM), 47, Via del Paradiso, University of ‘Tuscia’, 01100 Viterbo, Italy;, b.aquilani@unitus.it); Abbate, Tindara (Department of Economics, 1, Piazza Pugliatti, University of Messina, 98122 Messina, Italy;, abbatet@unime.it); Codini, Anna (Department of Economics and Management, 74/b, Via S.

We consider this a significant research gap and explore the relationship between smart contracts and sustainability in supply chains. First, we define the concept of smart contracts in terms of supply chain management. Then, we conduct a content analysis of the literature to explore the overlapping research fields of smart contracts and sustainability in supply chains. Next, we develop a semi-structured assessment framework to model the potential environmental and social impacts induced by smart contracts on supply chains. We propose a conceptual framework for supply chain maturity by mapping the relationships between organizational development, sustainability, and technology. We identify smart contracts as a foundational technology that enables efficient and transparent governance and collaborative self-coordination of human and non-human actors. Thus, we argue that smart contracts can contribute to the economic and social development of networked value chains and Society 5.0. To stimulate interdisciplinary research on smart contracts, we conclude the article by formulating research propositions and trade-offs for smart contracts in the context of technology development, business process and supply chain management, and sustainability.","The authors would like to thank their families for their ongoing support and sympathy for long working hours and late-night sessions in order to create this article, especially our children Jonathan, Charlotte, and Pia, as well as Christopher and Matthias.

Design/methodology/approach This study uses an event study method to examine the effect of SCI announcements on shareholder value of the 156 listed companies in China.   Findings  First, SCI announcements have a positive effect on shareholder value. Second, SCI with an integrated form more positively affects shareholder value than SCI with an independent form. SCI at the strategy level more positively affects shareholder value than SCI at the operation level. Technology-type SCI more positively affects shareholder value than process-type SCI. Third, this study finds that investors pay more attention to the SCI of companies in the service industry than that of in the manufacturing industry. Finally, the post-hoc analysis finds that digital SCI more positively affects shareholder value than intelligent SCI.    Originality/value First, most scholars use questionnaire data rather than second-hand data to conduct empirical research to explore the impact of SCI on performance. Second, although scholars focus on performance comprehensively, including operational, financial, relational and environmental performance, no scholars use an event study to explore the impact of SCI on the stock market. Third, no scholars have explored the differential impact of SCI in different industries. Forth, few scholars have classified SCI according to the characteristics to explore the differential impact of SCI.

The Core Product Service Platform,"There is a gap between the “radical” visions for Industry 5.0 and the practical solutions, which are mainly based on enabling technologies, we have seen so far. We still need more practical guidelines and cases to get an understanding of how, or whether Industry 5.0 could be relevant as an approach for manufacturing companies to meet the challenges they are facing. This paper investigates how Industry 5.0 can be the reference for developing capabilities needed for meeting the increasingly challenging market and sustainability requirements. To be able to capture all facets and effects of Industry 5.0, the sustainability, resilience and human centricity principles have to work jointly together aligned with roadmaps.

The sixteen papers published in this special issue aim at contributing to the main emerging research streams about human-technology integration in the next-generation manufacturing and logistics systems. In particular, four main macro-topics have emerged: human-machine integration, human-robot collaboration, worker assistance systems and work design 4.0. In the papers, novel conceptual frameworks and architectures are presented and laboratory tests are carried out, promoting relevant advances in the field of human-technology integration. Nevertheless, the analysis of the papers in the special issue reveals that it is still necessary to investigate and explore human-technology integration, especially by developing interfaces that increasingly support the operators. At the same time, it is necessary to rethink the traditional workforce, taking more account of human factors, which intervene in the tasks of operators and managers in order to increase technology acceptability and usage. As a result, there is a growing need to move towards Industry 5.0, with human-centred and socially sustainable design and development of new manufacturing and logistics solutions.",,Computers & Industrial Engineering,,,2022-07,2022,,2022-07,169,,108261,Closed,Article,"Cimini, Chiara; Lagorio, Alexandra; Cavalieri, Sergio; Riedel, Oliver; Pereira, Carlos E.; Wang, Jason","Cimini, Chiara (Department of Management, Information and Production Engineering, University of Bergamo, Italy); Lagorio, Alexandra (Department of Management, Information and Production Engineering, University of Bergamo, Italy); Cavalieri, Sergio (Department of Management, Information and Production Engineering, University of Bergamo, Italy); Riedel, Oliver (Institute for Control Engineering of Machine Tools and Manufacturing Units, University of Stuttgart, Germany); Pereira, Carlos E.

Instead, Industry 5.0 addresses social and planetary challenges caused or neglected in Industry 4.0 and below. One relevant the most relevant challenges of Industry 5.0 is the design of human-centered smart environments (i.e., that prioritize human well-being while maintaining production performance). In these environments, robots and humans will share the same space and collaborate to reach common objectives. This article presents a literature review of the different aspects concerning the problem of quality measurement in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) applications for manufacturing environments. To help practitioners and new researchers in the area, this article presents an overview of factors, metrics, and measures used in the robotics community to evaluate performance and human well-being quality aspects in HRI applications. For this, we performed a systematic search in relevant databases for robotics (Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, ACM digital library, and Springer Link). We summarize and classify results extracted from 102 peer-reviewed research articles published until March 2022 in two definition models: 1) a taxonomy of performance aspects and 2) a Venn Diagram of common human factors in HRI. Additionally, we briefly explain the differences between often confusing or overlapped concepts in the area. We also introduce common human factors evaluated by the robotics community and identify seven emergent research topics which can have a relevant impact on Industry 5.0.","This paper is based on results obtained from a project, JPNP20006, commissioned by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), Japan.",Journal of Manufacturing Systems,,,2022-04,2022,,2022-04,63,,392-410,Closed,Article,"Coronado, Enrique; Kiyokawa, Takuya; Ricardez, Gustavo A.

Keeping the transition phase from “Industry 4.0” to “Industry 5.0” in mind, the paper reinforces the role of the human factor and critically discusses the issues and challenges in the present organizational setup.   Design/methodology/approach Following the grounded theory approach, the study arranged in-depth interviews and focus group sessions with industry experts from various service-oriented firms in India. Dimensions of human factor identified from there were grouped together through a morphological analysis (MA), and interlinkages between them were explored through a cross-consistency matrix.   Findings This research work identified 20 critical dimensions of human factor and have grouped them under five important categories, namely, cohesive force, motivating force, regulating force, supporting force and functional force that drive quality performance in the supply chain domain.   Originality/value In line with the requirements of the present “Industry 4.0” and the forthcoming “Industry 5.0”, where the need to collaborate human factor with smart system gets priority, the paper made a novel attempt in presenting the critical human factors and categorizing them under important driving forces.

The industrial system is shifting from manufacturing worksite superiority to intelligence or software superiority in manufacturing. The government promotes these trends through its Society 5.0 initiative. Software superiority in manufacturing facilitates front loading; the conversion of skills to explicit knowledge makes progress in manufacturing processes through the use of IT and craftsmanship. This research deals with three cases. The first case is a company-developed system that’s scalable from customized products to standard products and that realizes diversified products via microscale production. The second case, focusing on the introduction of robots and a robot system integrator (SIer), is the keystone company within the SIer community; its business consists of robot engineering projects and FA educational system projects. The third case, metal 3D printing manufacturing, is invigorating. The company is the first service bureau in Japan that is capable of providing comprehensive services in the field of metal additive manufacturing (AM), handling everything from powder development and manufacture to prototyping and mass production needs. Clearly, IoT and the servitization of industry are the two wheels of a cart in industry, significantly transforming not only manufacturing sites but also business models. Although each case represents a different field of industry, each meets a unique and remarkable challenge in standardization, platform and ecosystem. In the digital age, IoT is an enabler and provides a background for transformation of business models. Through servitization, businesses can be the field for co-creation by feeding back the experience of learning-by-doing and reorganizing it. It is a powerful option for company to meet the challenge of service platform building.",,Future of Business and Finance,Transforming Japanese Business,,2019-12-07,2019,2019-12-07,2020,,,139-151,Closed,Chapter,"Odake, Nobutaka","Odake, Nobutaka (Regional Policy Research Center, Nagoya-shi, Aichi, Japan)","Odake, Nobutaka ","Odake, Nobutaka ()",1,1,,0.35,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123193331,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Healthcare systems in Society 5.0 envision an abstract paradigm that provides beyond health monitoring services to all the citizens of the society. These services include healthcare medical supply chain, clinical trial, and hospital management. To provide these services, the existing healthcare systems upload their important information, such as users’ health parameters, medicinal details, and clinical trial information into the cloud using PBCN (Ioppolo et al., 2020). Additionally, PBCN provides end-to-end security in uploading of such healthcare information in healthcare systems by decentralizing and distributing the information validation among multiple end-user devices. The existing PBCN-based healthcare systems enable its users to validate information before the transaction of healthcare information. Enabling such a facility in the healthcare systems of Society 5.0 increases the validation latency of PBCN in healthcare systems, considering the presence of a huge number of citizens in Society 5.0. On the other hand, the existing PBCN-based healthcare systems are unable to detect malicious end-users, which may degrade the efficiency of the healthcare systems of Society 5.0. We introduce B2H to address the issues of increasing validation latency and detecting malicious end-users in the healthcare systems of Society 5.0. The architecture of B2H utilizes the features of PBCN. B2H introduce a layer of validation service providers (VSPs) in a PBCN that collects information from the end-user, distributes it among multiple validation devices. VSP in B2H reduces the validation time by distributing the information among a specific set of validation devices (VDs). B2H also allows the end-user to optimally select a VSP and a VSP to select a set of validation devices optimally. Through extensive experiments, we observe that B2H performs better than the existing schemes by reducing 94%–95% average network delay, 88%–94% average energy consumption, and 94%–96% average cost.",,Computer Networks,,,2022-06,2022,,2022-06,210,,108860,Closed,Article,"Ghosh, Timam; Roy, Arijit; Misra, Sudip","Ghosh, Timam (Advanced Technology Development Centre, Kharagpur, 721302, India); Roy, Arijit (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, 721302, India); Misra, Sudip (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, 721302, India)","Roy, Arijit (Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur)","Ghosh, Timam (); Roy, Arijit (Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur); Misra, Sudip (Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145820004,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy,

For modern machines, the Internet of Things is a built-in function. In contrast, there are legacy machines in deployment functioning without digital communication. The need to connect them became popular to improve overall production efficiency. As building a new smart factory as a greenfield investment is a capital-intensive choice, retrofitting the existing infrastructure with IoT capability is more reasonable than replacing them. However, this so-called brownfield development, or retrofitting, requires specific prerequisites, e.g., digitization status assessment, technical and connectivity development, management requirement, and operational need, representing a significant disadvantage: lack of scalability. In the meantime, Industry 5.0 is under human-centric priority, which poses new challenges to the retrofitted system. Aware of the challenge, this paper provides a systematic overview of brownfield development regarding technical difficulties, supporting technologies, and possible applications for the legacy system. The research scope focuses on available Industry 4.0 advancements but considers preparing for the forthcoming Industry 5.0. The proposed retrofitting project approach can be a guideline for manufacturers to transform their factories into intelligent spaces with minimal cost and effort but still gain the most applicable solution for management needs. The future direction for other research in brownfield development for Industry 5.0 is also discussed.",,IEEE Access,,,2022-01-01,2022,2022-06-13,2022-01-01,10,,64348-64374,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tran, Tuan-Anh; Ruppert, Tamás; Eigner, György; Abonyi, János","Tran, Tuan-Anh (MTA-PE ‘Lendulet’ Complex Systems Monitoring Research Group, Department of Process Engineering, University of Pannonia, 8200, Veszprém, Hungary; Physiological Controls Research Center, John von Neumann Faculty of Informatics, Biomatics and Applied Artificial Intelligence Institution, Óbuda University, 1034, Budapest, Hungary; Department of Mechanical Engineering, School of Mechanical Engineering, Vietnam Maritime University, Haiphong, 180000, Vietnam); Ruppert, Tamás (MTA-PE ‘Lendulet’ Complex Systems Monitoring Research Group, Department of Process Engineering, University of Pannonia, 8200, Veszprém, Hungary); Eigner, György (Physiological Controls Research Center, John von Neumann Faculty of Informatics, Biomatics and Applied Artificial Intelligence Institution, Óbuda University, 1034, Budapest, Hungary); Abonyi, János (MTA-PE ‘Lendulet’ Complex Systems Monitoring Research Group, Department of Process Engineering, University of Pannonia, 8200, Veszprém, Hungary)","Ruppert, Tamás (University of Pannonia)","Tran, Tuan-Anh (University of Pannonia; Óbuda University; Vietnam Maritime University); Ruppert, Tamás (University of Pannonia); Eigner, György (Óbuda University); Abonyi, János (University of Pannonia)",0,0,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/09794677.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148625991,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Digital Platform and Digital Ecosystem,"The paper proposes conceptual model of a digital platform for cyber-physical management of modern enterprises in the upcoming era of Industry 5.0. Unlike Industry 4.0, which focuses on automation of physical processes, Industry 5.0 is oriented on digitization of knowledge and automation of reasoning processes for creating artificial intelligence that is able to manage enterprises. This still emerging era will be characterized by the vision of any business, including industrial production or logistics, as a complex adaptive system built on fundamental principles of self-organization and evolution, as well as interaction of artificial intelligence systems and humans. The paper shows that implementation of such production and logistics management systems will require development of new models and decision-making methods based on knowledge and semantic information processing, integration of computational and communication components, accumulation of big data and its processing for predictive analytics, blockchain technologies for fixing mutual obligations of systems components in the for m of smar t contracts, as well as human-machine and software inter faces. Existing approaches to creation of digital platforms within the digital economy of Industry 4.0 and their limitations are analyzed. The concept of digital ecosystem is developed as an open, distributed, self-organized ""system of systems"" of smart services capable of coming up with solutions and automatically resolving conflicts through negotiations and concessions. The concept of the digital platform within Industry 5.0 is described, which will be able to support functioning of the digital ecosystem of ""smart services"" of cyberphysical management of both individual objects and enterprises of humans and robots, and in the future, industries of such enterprises — implemented using self-organizing autonomous agents at all levels.",,"Мехатроника, автоматизация, управление",,,2019-06-06,2019,2019-06-06,,20,6,323-332,Closed,Article,"Gorodetsky, V.

It provides an overview of the role of Facility Location in Logistics and Transportation highlighting the contribution of TRE to such an enduring relationship. Several conventional problems are revisited showing that the three above fields have been intertwined for a long time. Nevertheless, the role of Facility Location has become even stronger in the past decades due to challenges posed by new technological developments together with a fast economy globalization and a strong increase in environmental concerns. This has called for the study of more complex problems and the development of comprehensive mathematical models leading to major advances in areas such as reverse and green logistics, humanitarian supply chains, and multimodal transportation, to mention a few. These and other related topics are discussed. Hedging against uncertainty has gained much practical relevance and thus it will be much in focus throughout the paper. Several current trends and future challenges are thoroughly discussed. These include but are not limited to the steps already made and those still missing for paving the way from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0, as well as the challenges posed by data-driven decision making in the Era of big data.","The author thanks the editors of Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review (TRE) for the invitation to write this paper.

Design/methodology/approach This research is performed through a bibliographic review in the electronic databases of the Emerald Insight, the Scopus and the Web of Science, considering the main scientific publications on the subject.   Findings The bibliographic search results in 526 articles, followed by two sequential filters for deleting the duplicate articles (resulting in 487 articles) and for selecting the most relevant articles (resulting in 150 articles).   Practical implications This article identifies the opportunities and the challenges focused on the emerging Industry 4.0 theme. The opportunities can contribute to the sustainable performance of the supply chains and their territories. The Industry 4.0 can also generate challenges like the social inequalities related to the position of the man in the labor market by replacing the human workforce with the machines. Therefore, the man-machine relationship in the Industry 4.0 era is analyzed as a gap in the literature. Therefore, as a way to fill this gap, the authors of this article suggest the exploration of the research focused on the Society 5.0. Also known as “super-smart society,” this recent theme appeared in Japan in April 2016. According to Fukuda (2020), in addition to the focus on the technological development, the Society 5.0 also aims at the quality of life and the social challenge resolutions.   Originality/value This article contributes to the analysis of the Industry 4.0 technologies as facilitators in the sustainable supply chain performance. It addresses the impacts of the Industry 4.0 technologies applied to the supply chains in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it analyzes the research gaps and limitations found in the literature. The result of this study can add value and stimulate new research studies related to the application of the Industry 4.0 technologies as facilitators in the supply chain sustainable performance. It can encourage the studies related to the COVID-19 impacts on the sustainable supply chains, and it can promote the research development on the relationship among the man, the machine and the labor in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.","This paper forms part of a special section “Managing Industry 4.0 technologies and their impact on the sustainable performance of territories”, guest edited by Ilias Vlachos, Morgane Fritz, Salomée Ruel and Vikas Kumar.Funding: This work was supported by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior–Brazil–CAPES (Finance Code 001) and the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development–CNPq (grant number 311881/2019-0).",International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management,,,2021-02-01,2021,2021-02-01,2021-06-02,70,5,988-1016,Closed,Article,"Acioli, Carina; Scavarda, Annibal; Reis, Augusto","Acioli, Carina (Production Engineering and Systems, Federal Center for Technological Education Celso Suckow da Fonseca, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Scavarda, Annibal (Production Engineering, Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Reis, Augusto (Production Engineering and Systems, Federal Center for Technological Education Celso Suckow da Fonseca, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)","Acioli, Carina (Federal Center for Technological Education Celso Suckow da Fonseca)","Acioli, Carina (Federal Center for Technological Education Celso Suckow da Fonseca); Scavarda, Annibal (Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro); Reis, Augusto (Federal Center for Technological Education Celso Suckow da Fonseca)",54,54,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135539603,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3505 Human Resources and Industrial Relations; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour","12 Responsible Consumption and Production; 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

997,pub.1145361420,10.1016/j.jmsy.2022.02.001,,,Outlook on human-centric manufacturing towards Industry 5.0,"The recent shift to wellbeing, sustainability, and resilience under Industry 5.0 has prompted formal discussions that manufacturing should be human-centric – placing the wellbeing of industry workers at the center of manufacturing processes, instead of system-centric – only driven by efficiency and quality improvement and cost reduction. However, there is a lack of shared understanding of the essence of human-centric manufacturing, though significant research efforts exist in enhancing the physical and cognitive wellbeing of operators. Therefore, this position paper presents our arguments on the concept, needs, reference model, enabling technologies and system frameworks of human-centric manufacturing, providing a relatable vision and research agenda for future work in human-centric manufacturing systems. We believe human-centric manufacturing should ultimately address human needs defined in an Industrial Human Needs Pyramid – from basic needs of safety and health to the highest level of esteem and self-actualization. In parallel, human-machine relationships will change following a 5C evolution map – from current Coexistence, Cooperation and Collaboration to future Compassion and Coevolution. As such, human-centric manufacturing systems need to have bi-directional empathy, proactive communication and collaborative intelligence for establishing trustworthy human-machine coevolution relationships, thereby leading to high-performance human-machine teams. It is suggested that future research focus should be on developing transparent, trustworthy and quantifiable technologies that provide a rewarding working environment driven by real-world needs.",This study was supported by grants from The University of Auckland FRDF New Staff Research Fund (No. 3720540).,Journal of Manufacturing Systems,,,2022-01,2022,,2022-01,62,,612-627,Closed,Article,"Lu, Yuqian; Zheng, Hao; Chand, Saahil; Xia, Wanqing; Liu, Zengkun; Xu, Xun; Wang, Lihui; Qin, Zhaojun; Bao, Jinsong","Lu, Yuqian (Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand); Zheng, Hao (Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand); Chand, Saahil (Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand); Xia, Wanqing (Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand); Liu, Zengkun (Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand); Xu, Xun (Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand); Wang, Lihui (Department of Production Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden); Qin, Zhaojun (Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand); Bao, Jinsong (College of Mechanical Engineering, Donghua University, Shanghai, China)","Lu, Yuqian (University of Auckland)","Lu, Yuqian (University of Auckland); Zheng, Hao (University of Auckland); Chand, Saahil (University of Auckland); Xia, Wanqing (University of Auckland); Liu, Zengkun (University of Auckland); Xu, Xun (University of Auckland); Wang, Lihui (Royal Institute of Technology); Qin, Zhaojun (University of Auckland); Bao, Jinsong (Donghua University)",15,15,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145361420,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Recent years have indeed assisted in drawing attention to the human-centric design of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) and to the genesis of the ‘Operator 4.0’, two novel concepts that raise significant ethical questions regarding the impact of technology on workers and society at large. This paper argues that a value-oriented and ethical technology engineering in Industry 5.0 is an urgent and sensitive topic as demonstrated by a survey administered to industry leaders from different companies. The Value Sensitive Design (VSD) approach is proposed as a principled framework to illustrate how technologies enabling human–machine symbiosis in the Factory of the Future can be designed to embody elicited human values and to illustrate actionable steps that engineers and designers can take in their design projects. Use cases based on real solutions and prototypes discuss how a design-for-values approach aids in the investigation and mitigation of ethical issues emerging from the implementation of technological solutions and, hence, support the migration to a symbiotic Factory of the Future.","The use cases and prototypes showed in the survey build upon solutions and projects developed by CAL-TEK S.r.l., a Spin-off company of the University of Calabria, Italy and carried out at the Modeling &amp; Simulation Center – Laboratory of Enterprise Solutions (MSC-LES) at the Department of Mechanical, Energy and Management Engineering of the University of Calabria, such as the W-Artemys project, financed by INAIL (Italian National Institute for Insurance against Accidents at Work).

Industry 4.0 takes a significant part of everyday life. There is no way. The application of digital life on smart phones, touch screens and smart classrooms may be significant indicators of this. Not just computer information and life but also human-like robotics would take a long time. In the immediate future, you will also see the picture of a modern 5.0 model for manufacturing. Since of emerging technology and increasingly evolving and increasing AI-based approaches, remaining on the top is getting more and more challenging. Robots are much more relevant as now the brain-machine’s technology can be merged with the human mind, as artificial intelligence advances. There are coercive problems in the world economy because efficiency is to be improved without the human workforce being robbed of the manufacturing sector. This paper presents the idea of sustainable business 5.0, where machines are intertwined with the human brain and function as partners rather than rivals, against these obstacles. In addition, the effect of Industry 5.0, which is more likely to create more jobs than to reduce, will be discussed on manufacturing and the economy as a whole.

In fact, Industry 5.0 focuses on research and innovation to support industrial production sustainability and place the well-being of industrial workers at the center of the production process. Thus, Industry 5.0 relies on three pillars: it is human-centric, it encourages sustainability and it is aimed at developing resilience against disruptions. Such core aspects cannot be fully achieved without a transparent end-to-end human-centered traceability throughout the value chain. As a consequence, Auto-Identification (Auto-ID) technologies play a key role, since they are able to provide automated item recognition, positioning and tracking without human intervention or in cooperation with industrial operators. Although the most popular Auto-ID technologies provide a certain degree of security and productivity, there are still open challenges for future Industry 5.0 factories. This article analyzes and evaluates the Auto-ID landscape and delivers a holistic perspective and understanding of the most popular and the latest technologies, looking for solutions that cope with harsh, diverse and complex industrial scenarios. In addition, it describes a methodology for selecting Auto-ID technologies for Industry 5.0 factories. Such a methodology is applied to a specific use case of the shipbuilding industry that requires identifying the main components of a ship during its construction and repair. To validate the outcomes of the methodology, a practical evaluation of passive and active UHF RFID tags was performed in an Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV) under construction, showing that a careful selection and evaluation of the tags enables product identification and tracking even in areas with a very high density of metallic objects. As a result, this article serves as a useful guide for industrial stakeholders, including future developers and managers that seek for deploying identification and traceability technologies in Industry 5.0 scenarios.","This work was supported in part by the Auto-Identification for Intelligent Products Research Line of the Navantia-Universidade da Coruña Joint Research Unit under Grant IN853B-2018/02, and in part by the Centro de Investigación de Galicia ‘‘CITIC,’’ funded by Xunta de Galicia and the European Union (European Regional Development Fund-Galicia 2014–2020 Program) under Grant ED431G 2019/01.

Physical activity monitoring digital platforms are architected to improve the healthcare status of patients with diabetes and other lifestyle-related diseases. Furthermore, digital platforms are expected to generate profits for health technology companies and help control costs in the healthcare ecosystem. However, current digital enterprise architecture approaches are not well-established, and the potentials have not yet been realized. Design thinking approach and agile software development methodologies can overcome these limitations, beginning with proof of concept and pilot projects and then scaling to the production environment. In this paper, we describe how that the adaptive integrated digital architecture framework (AIDAF) for Design Thinking approach is proposed and verified in a case of a university hospital in the Americas.

To achieve symbiotic human–robot interaction (HRI), the safety issue serves as a prerequisite foundation. Regarding the growing individualized demand of manufacturing tasks, the conventional rule-based safe HRI measures could not well address the safety requirements due to inflexibility and lacking synergy. To fill the gap, this work proposes a mutual-cognitive safe HRI approach including worker visual augmentation, robot velocity control, Digital Twin-enabled motion preview and collision detection, and Deep Reinforcement Learning-based robot collision avoidance motion planning in the Augmented Reality-assisted manner. Finally, the feasibility of the system design and the performance of the proposed approach are validated by establishing and executing the prototype HRI system in a practical scene.","The work described in this paper was partially supported by grants from the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong SAR, China (Project No. PolyU 15210222); the Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence in Design (Project Code: RP2-1), Innovation and Technology Fund, Hong Kong SAR, China; and the Collaborative Departmental General Research Fund (G-UAMS) from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR, China.",Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,,,2023-04,2023,,2023-04,80,,102471,Closed,Article,"Li, Chengxi; Zheng, Pai; Yin, Yue; Pang, Yat Ming; Huo, Shengzeng","Li, Chengxi (Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China; Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence in Design, Hong Kong Science Park, New Territories, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China); Zheng, Pai (Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China; Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence in Design, Hong Kong Science Park, New Territories, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China); Yin, Yue (Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China); Pang, Yat Ming (Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China; Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence in Design, Hong Kong Science Park, New Territories, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China); Huo, Shengzeng (Department of Mechanical Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China)","Zheng, Pai (Hong Kong Polytechnic University; )","Li, Chengxi (Hong Kong Polytechnic University); Zheng, Pai (Hong Kong Polytechnic University); Yin, Yue (Hong Kong Polytechnic University); Pang, Yat Ming (Hong Kong Polytechnic University); Huo, Shengzeng (Hong Kong Polytechnic University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151946981,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

However, it is crucial to know the factors influencing technological innovation in a green supply chain. Some preconceptions show that technological innovation in a business can be affected by internal and external factors, and therefore there must be correlations between such factors to flourish the technological innovation and, subsequently, the green supply chain. Besides, predicting the technological innovation level in a supply chain can be vital and direct it to the Industry 5.0 goals. In this research, a 3-phased framework will be proposed to predict the Technological Innovation Level of Green Supply Chains. The scope of this research includes Green Investment, Eco-friendly Design and Customer Collaborations. In the 1st phase of the framework, dependent and independent factors considering the scope of the Research will be determined; and then, using statistical data analysis, the weight of factors, which reflects their impact on technological innovation (dependent factor), will be determined. Then, in the 2nd phase, a comprehensive model will be developed and trained. Using the data of supply chains that were gathered in the first phase, the train and test data would be selected. In continuation, the model will be trained and its performance will be evaluated using some metrics. Then, in the last phase (phase 3), the developed model will be used to predict the technological level of supply chains. The outcomes of this research can help top managers of supply chains to predict the level of technological innovation by investing a certain budget in improving the dependent variables. The outcomes demonstrated that Customer Collaboration (0.481), Eco-friendly design (0.419) and Green Investment (0.41) have significant impacts on technological innovation improvement in the studied cases, respectively. Besides, the results showed the superiority of the K-nearest Neighbor algorithm while using the Minkowski distance method and considering 5 neighbors. The findings indicated that the proposed framework could predict Technological Innovation with 0.751 accuracies. The outcomes of this research can be helpful for industry owners to predict the expected technological innovation level of their system by investing a certain budget in green investment, eco-friendly design and customer collaborations in their enterprises.",,RAIRO - Operations Research,,,2022-07,2022,2022-08-22,2022-07,56,4,2775-2800,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Beigizadeh, Razieh; Delgoshaei, Aidin; Ariffin, Mohd Khairol Anuar; Hanjani, Sepehr Esmaeili; Ali, Ahad","Beigizadeh, Razieh (Department of Management, Islamic Azad University, Rasht Branch, Rasht, 41335, Guilan, Iran); Delgoshaei, Aidin (Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, 43400, Selangor, Malaysia); Ariffin, Mohd Khairol Anuar (Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, 43400, Selangor, Malaysia); Hanjani, Sepehr Esmaeili (Department of Management, Islamic Azad University, North Tehran Branch, Tehran, 14515, Tehran, Iran); Ali, Ahad (Department of Industrial Engineering, Lawrence Technological University, Southfield, MI, 48075, USA)","Delgoshaei, Aidin (Universiti Putra Malaysia)","Beigizadeh, Razieh (Islamic Azad University, Lahijan Branch); Delgoshaei, Aidin (Universiti Putra Malaysia); Ariffin, Mohd Khairol Anuar (Universiti Putra Malaysia); Hanjani, Sepehr Esmaeili (Islamic Azad University, Tehran); Ali, Ahad (Lawrence Technological University)",0,0,,,https://www.rairo-ro.org/articles/ro/pdf/2022/04/ro210309.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148657767,49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics,"12 Responsible Consumption and Production; 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Future factory floor workers will work in teams that include both human co-workers and smart machine actors. The visions of Industry 5.0 describe sustainable, resilient, and human-centered future factories that will require smart and resilient capabilities both from next-generation manufacturing systems and human operators. What kinds of approaches can help design these kinds of resilient human–machine teams and collaborations within them? In this paper, we analyze this design challenge, and we propose basing the design on the joint cognitive systems approach. The established joint cognitive systems approach can be complemented with approaches that support human centricity in the early phases of design, as well as in the development of continuously co-evolving human–machine teams. We propose approaches to observing and analyzing the collaboration in human–machine teams, developing the concept of operations with relevant stakeholders, and including ethical aspects in the design and development.

Under the background of double carbon, green innovation and intelligent production of manufacturing enterprises have become the general trend of sustainable development. It is particularly important to study the integration of digital technology into green innovation and production processes to improve the performance of digital green innovation and the competitiveness of enterprises. However, the integration of digital technology and green innovation from the perspective of knowledge management has not been fully introduced into current literatures. In this study, hierarchical regression and fsQCA approaches were used to empirically verify the adoption process of digital green innovation activities and the impact of digital green knowledge creation on digital green innovation performance (DGIP), and explores the moderating effects of digital green risk perception (DGRP) and digital green complexity perception (DGCC) through 429 questionnaires from Chinese manufacturing enterprises. In addition, knowledge search is divided into three dimensions: scientific digital green knowledge search (SDGKS), market digital green knowledge search (MDGKS) and supply chain digital green knowledge search (SCDGKS). The results show that: i) SDGKS promotes exploitative digital green knowledge creation (EDGKC). MDGKS has a positive impact on both utilizing digital green knowledge creation (ADGKC) and EDGKC. SCDGKS promotes EDGKC. ii) The relationship between SDGKS and EDGKC is only moderated by DGCC (positive). The relationship between MDGKS and EDGKC is only moderated by DGCC (negative). The relationship between SCDGKS and EDGKC is moderated by DGRP (negative) and DGCC (negative). iii) There is an inverted U-shaped relationship between ADGKC and DGIP. There is a U-shaped relationship between EDGKC and DGIP. The essence of this study is to help manufacturing enterprises find external partners to improve their digital green innovation performance through external knowledge search partner selection. The conclusion of this study has certain theoretical contribution to the clarification of the complex process of digital green innovation. This study provides a theoretical basis for enterprises to select knowledge search partners according to their own environment to carry out digital green innovation activities smoothly.

Indeed, the optimization and improvement of the manufacturing processes have to meet cost criteria related to energy consumption, safety, and implementation of new technologies. The development of better and more advanced technologies boosts Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) in the manufacturing processes. However, due to the high number of safety standards about collaborative robotics and the absence of tools and specific design approaches, collaborative robots (cobots) are still widely adopted as traditional industrial robots wasting the huge potential of a properly Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC). The layout designing is a crucial activity in achieving a proper and effective HRC. This work illustrates how to transfer standard-compliant layout solutions towards an interactive three-dimensional (3D) visualization environment in order to enable the digital prototyping of HRC workplaces. The possibility to automatically generate and visualize multiple layout solutions of collaborative workplaces, and then, to simulate the interaction between human and robot, represents one of the most significant tasks during the designing process. HRC workplace layout is designed according to an optimization criterion, by using the full integration of a numerical computing platform with an interactive 3D visualization environment. Then, by means of the variation of the input parameters, the visualization of new layout solutions is enabled in a fast and effective way.","This study was developed with the economic support of MUR (Italian Ministry of Universities and Research) under the remit of project ARS01_00861, ‘Integrated collaborative systems for smart factory – ICOSAF”.",Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering,"Advances on Mechanics, Design Engineering and Manufacturing IV",,2022-09-25,2022,2022-09-25,2023,,,454-465,Closed,Chapter,"Di Marino, Castrese; Rega, Andrea; Vitolo, Ferdinando; Patalano, Stanislao","Di Marino, Castrese (Fraunhofer J-Lab IDEAS, Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy); Rega, Andrea (Fraunhofer J-Lab IDEAS, Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy); Vitolo, Ferdinando (Fraunhofer J-Lab IDEAS, Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy); Patalano, Stanislao (Fraunhofer J-Lab IDEAS, Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy)","Rega, Andrea (University of Naples Federico II)","Di Marino, Castrese (University of Naples Federico II); Rega, Andrea (University of Naples Federico II); Vitolo, Ferdinando (University of Naples Federico II); Patalano, Stanislao (University of Naples Federico II)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151303985,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

897,pub.1146140036,10.3390/automation3010008,,,Digital Twin of a Flexible Manufacturing System for Solutions Preparation,"In the last few decades, there has been a growing necessity for systems that handle market changes and personalized customer needs with near mass production efficiency, defined as the new mass customization paradigm. The Industry 5.0 vision further enhances the human-centricity aspect, in the necessity for manufacturing systems to cooperate with workers, taking advantage of their problem-solving capabilities, creativity, and expertise of the manufacturing process. A solution is to develop a flexible manufacturing system capable of handling different customer requests and real-time decisions from operators. This paper tackles these aspects by proposing a digital twin of a robotic system for solution preparation capable of making real-time scheduling decisions and forecasts using a simulation model while allowing human interventions. A discrete event simulation model was used to forecast possible system improvements. The simulation handles real-time scheduling considering the possibility of adding identical parallel machines. Results show that processing multiple jobs simultaneously with more than one machine on critical processes, increasing the robot speed, and using heuristics that emphasize the shortest transportation time can reduce the overall completion time by 82%.

The use of RFID is particularly suited to IIoT as it does not require a line of sight for communication and can be retroactively affixed to non-smart items. However, RFID communication is affected by the properties of the material the tag is affixed to, specifically the material permittivity. Metal is commonly present in smart factory environments and supply chains and impedes RFID communication. A suitable tag design is required to accommodate these challenges and ensure resilience for Industry 5.0 applications. The research presented in this paper has assessed the communication performance of RFID antenna designs with and without metal present beneath the tag. The RFID tag designs that performed reliably in the simulation were manufactured, and their read range was tested on materials of varying relative permittivity and thickness to represent MP and NMP scenarios. The results have verified the robustness of “Cyber” to “Physical” designs and provide recommendations to support practitioner IIoT tag selection.",,The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,,,2022-06-28,2022,2022-06-28,2022-07,121,5-6,3903-3917,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Tribe, James; Hayward, Steven; van Lopik, Katherine; Whittow, William G.; West, Andrew A.","Tribe, James (The Wolfson School of Mechanical Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, Leicestershire, UK); Hayward, Steven (The Wolfson School of Mechanical Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, Leicestershire, UK); van Lopik, Katherine (The Wolfson School of Mechanical Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, Leicestershire, UK); Whittow, William G.

895,pub.1148184350,10.1016/j.procir.2022.05.042,,,An IIoT Platform For Human-Aware Factory Digital Twins,"In the context of the Industry 4.0 approach, applications and solutions supporting monitoring, simulation, optimisation and decision-making in production systems are exponentially growing. These solutions are commonly built on digital twins, i.e., comprehensive, structured and effective digital representations of the production system and its entities, whose current status is constantly updated by the plugged data sources. The arising of the Industry 5.0 paradigm and the established key role of workers in manufacturing require new Digital Twins to represent also humans. In fact, as cognitive automation becomes more and more pervasive and its behaviour unintelligible to humans, it becomes essential for improving performance and well-being, at the same time, to model humans as data-driven agents and to represent their interaction with the factory systems. Currently, a standardised solution for creating Digital Twins is missing, forcing industrial solution architects to resort to ad-hoc implementations and models. These solutions lack re-usability, scalability and extensibility, preventing the introduction of a human digital representation in existent twins, so hindering the complete shift to the new Industry 5.0 paradigm. In this paper, such limitations are faced by introducing an extensible and flexible IIoT-industrial internet of things-based platform with a twofold benefit: on the one hand, to support the creation of customised data representations of production systems and their entities including humans; on the other hand, to provide a modular infrastructure, along with its interchangeable components, for easy digital twin instantiation and ramp-up. An implementation of the platform has been tested with different applications in a laboratory setting and released as a public resource.

The ambitious goal of zero defects requires the extensive utilization of emerging technologies. Amidst the major drive for technological advancement, humans are often kept out of the loop because they are perceived as the root cause of error. The report from the European Commission on Industry 5.0 emphasizes that human-centric is a key pillar in building a more resilient industry and is vital to incorporate the human component into the manufacturing sector. However, we did not find any publications that explain what human-centric ZDM is, nor what the roles of humans are in advancing ZDM. As a contribution to bridging this gap, a systematic literature review is conducted using different databases. We collected 36 publications and categorised them into 3 different human roles which are managers, engineers, and operators. From our search, we found out that managers play a vital role in cultivating ZDM in the entire organization to prevent errors despite the fact they often do not have direct contact with the production line as operators. Operators can help advance ZDM through knowledge capturing with feedback functions to the engineer to better design a corrective action to prevent errors. Assistive technologies such as extended reality are efficient tools used by operators to eliminate human errors in production environments. Human-centric is now a goal in the future manufacturing sector, but it could face barriers such as high technological investments and resistance to changes in their work tasks. This paper can contribute to paving the roadmap of human-centric ZDM to bring defects to zero and reposition the manufacturing sector to become more resilient.",The authors appreciate the support and valuable discussions with old and new colleagues at SINTEF and the NTNU – The Norwegian University of Science and Technology.,Computers in Industry,,,2023-01,2023,,2023-01,144,,103792,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Wan, Paul Kengfai; Leirmo, Torbjørn Langedahl","Wan, Paul Kengfai (SINTEF Manufacturing AS, Grøndalsvegen 2, 2830 Raufoss, Norway); Leirmo, Torbjørn Langedahl (SINTEF Manufacturing AS, Grøndalsvegen 2, 2830 Raufoss, Norway)","Wan, Paul Kengfai (SINTEF)","Wan, Paul Kengfai (SINTEF); Leirmo, Torbjørn Langedahl (SINTEF)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2022.103792,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151954909,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4601 Applied Computing; 4609 Information Systems,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

In general, industry 4.0 focuses on the metamorphosis of all industrial components with the help of strong digital support. It's very often interlinked with the successful fourth industrial revolution. It is to be noted that the very fourth outburst of industrialization plunges forward in order to achieve an optimized and sustained form of production. With the uplift of the fourth generation of this stirring revolution, the efficient extraction of advanced informatics analytics along with internetworked machines have grown to a great extent, complementing the digital platform. On the other hand, society 5.0 involves a human centric community which is capable of striking a balance between the economical proliferations and resolving societal liabilities by the core combination of cyber and physical space. Just like how industry 4.0 carries out the digital transformation of every industrial perspective, society 5.0 encourages mundane life to leap towards a digital revamp expanding across different tiers of the community. Indeed, the rapid change of information and Communication Technology along with the portrayal of society 5.0 as a global trend and a key aspect of the Science and Technology Basic plan, the interplay of the two proves to be a constant support for each other.

These technologies improve working conditions and increase productivity and the quality of industry production. However, they can also improve life and society as a whole. A new perspective is oriented towards social well-being and it is called Society 5.0. Industry 4.0 supports the transition to the new society, but other drivers are also needed. To guide the transition, it is necessary to identify the enabling factors that integrate Industry 4.0. A conceptual framework was developed in which these factors were identified through a literature review and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) methodology. Furthermore, the way in which they relate was evaluated with the help of the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) methodology. The proposed framework fills a research gap, which has not yet consolidated a strategy that includes all aspects of Society 5.0.

It has seen a rapid increase in the elderly population and a decrease in the birth rate. This caused Japan to be a hyper-ageing society. Japanese’s first Baby-boomers who were born in 1947-1949 are now entering old age. Elderly care is a major problem in Japan. Children and care-workers for elderly parents are scarce. Therefore, the second Baby-boomers (born in 1971-1974) aged 40-50 years old have quit working to care for their elderly parents. This situation is known as ‘kaigo rishoku.’ This study looked into the practice of elderly care in Japanese 5.0 Society. Society 5.0 is a concept developed by Japan. It is human-centred and technology-based. In society 5.0, robots and the internet play an essential role in human life. Therefore, we proposed a critical question: Can robots replace humans to care for the elderly in Society 5.0? This study used the qualitative method with a phenomenological approach and descriptive analysis. The results revealed that although robots can assist elderly care, due to the high cost, only a certain elderly can buy them. Therefore, in order for robots to become caregivers of the future, mass production is needed. Thus, robots can be marketed at relatively lower prices. However, sick elderly who live alone still need human assistance. On the one hand, technology helps human life in Society 5.0. On the other hand, the human touch is still necessary for elderly care.",,Jurnal Studi Komunikasi (Indonesian Journal of Communications Studies),,,2020-07-01,2020,2020-07-01,,4,2,435-452,All OA; Gold,Article,"Elsy, Putri","Elsy, Putri (Airlangga University)",,"Elsy, Putri (Airlangga University)",5,5,,5.29,https://ejournal.unitomo.ac.id/index.php/jsk/article/download/2448/1166,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128912509,44 Human Society; 4403 Demography,

Society 5.0 offers a human-centered society that makes a balance between economic progress and the resolution of social problems through a system that is highly connected through cyberspace and the real world. If society 4.0 allows anyone to access also share information on the internet. Society 5.0 is an era where all technology is part of humanity itself. To take advantage of opportunities and answer the challenges of the industrial revolution 4.0, Indonesian people in particular are required to have data, technology and human literacy capabilities. Data literacy is needed by HR to improve skills in processing and analyzing big data for the benefit of improving public and business services. Technology literacy shows the ability to utilize digital technology to process data and information, while human literacy must be mastered because it shows the element of soft skills or the development of individual character to be able to collaborate, be adaptive, and innovative. Indonesia is demanded to be able to follow industry 4.0 workflows juxtaposed with society 5.0. The need for human resources in several business fields is still very massive if all of them are carried out by robotics. Indonesia is a developing country with a fairly dense population that is certainly able to align between the needs of industry 4.0 and society 5.0.

How shared economy can perform a superlative role in augmenting the corporate sustainable performance is another interesting gap that needs to be unveiled. This study investigates the linkage between shared economy practices and corporate triple bottom line (TBL) in three core streams—environmental performance (ENVP), social performance (SP), and economic performance (EP)—using empirical data. An additional factor of industry 5.0 (i5.0) technologies was treated as a moderator between shared economy and TBL. The findings assured the positive nexus of shared economy (i.e., contract manufacturing services, professional services, data entry & clerical services, creative and multimedia services, sales and marketing services, software development services, and writing or translation services) on TBL (i.e., ENVP, SP, and EP). The positive moderating influence of i5.0 technologies was further affirmed between the relationships of shared economy and TBL. The findings yield multidimensional insights for operational management to adopt shared economy and i5.0 practices to improve corporate TBL in today’s competitive era. In addition, this study accentuates the notion of shared economy by providing positive evidence from developing nations.

To ensure the continuity and robustness of industrial IoT communications in the case of damaged infrastructure communication facilities postdisaster, the industrial IoT can be connected with satellite networks in emergencies. This article presents a cross-regional, end-to-end, transmission control scheme for satellite-supported, multihop industrial IoT. The proposed scheme adjusts the window of data transmission from two phases, slow start and congestion avoidance, to accommodate the low-transmission performance caused by a long delay and high bit error rate in converged networks. The window of data transmission is also adjusted to increase the amount of data transmission for the slow start to fill the high bandwidth-delay product of the converged network, while adjusting the threshold of data transmission based on feedback information to distinguish different data losses during congestion avoidance. The feasibility of the heterogeneous network transmission model is experimentally verified. The results show that the scheme can achieve good performance in heterogeneous networks of industrial IoT and satellite networks. The scheme is effective in ensuring the continuity and stability of intelligent machine production in Industry 5.0 in emergency communication cases.","This work was supported by the Scientific Research Fund of Hunan Provincial Education Department under Grant 19B512, in part by Henan Scientific and Technological Research Project under Grant 212102210557, and in part by Key project of Guizhou Science and Technology Support Program under Grant Guizhou Key Science and Support [2021]-001.",IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,,,2021-12-10,2021,2021-12-10,,18,6,4215-4223,Closed,Article,"Zong, Liang; Memon, Fida Hussain; Li, Xingwang; Wang, Han; Dev, Kapal","Zong, Liang (College of Information Engineering, Shaoyang University, Shaoyang, 422000, China); Memon, Fida Hussain (Department of Electrical Engineering, Sukkur IBA University, Sukkur, 65200, Pakistan; Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Jeju National University, Jeju, 63243, South Korea); Li, Xingwang (School of Physics and Electronic Information Engineering, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, 454000, China); Wang, Han (College of Physical Scienc and Engineering, Yichun University, Yichun, 336000, China); Dev, Kapal (Department of Institute of Intelligent Systems, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, 2006, South Africa)","Li, Xingwang (Henan Polytechnic University)","Zong, Liang (Shaoyang University); Memon, Fida Hussain (Sukkur IBA University; Jeju National University); Li, Xingwang (Henan Polytechnic University); Wang, Han (Yichun University); Dev, Kapal (University of Johannesburg)",5,5,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143757265,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Here, formulated problem is divided into two subproblems, channel assignment and power optimization in order to lower computational complexity. A partial resource multiplexing scheme is proposed that will allocate channels to available D2D users. Later, power optimization problem is formulated which is determined through Lagrangian dual optimization technique. Dynamic sectorization overcomes issue of increase in user traffic. Stability factor, fairness index (FI), and energy efficiency depict the performance superiority of proposed scheme over existing schemes.

However, working closely with a robot may lead to the creation of stressful situations for the operator, which can negatively affect task performance. In Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), robots are expected to be socially intelligent, that is, capable of understanding and reacting accordingly to human social and affective clues. This ability can be exploited implementing affective computing, which concerns the development of systems able to recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affects. Social intelligence is essential for robots to establish a natural interaction with people in several contexts, including the manufacturing sector with the emergence of Industry 5.0. In order to take full advantage of the human-robot collaboration, the robotic system should be able to perceive the psycho-emotional and mental state of the operator through different sensing modalities (e.g. facial expressions, body language, voice, or physiological signals) and to adapt its behavior accordingly. The development of socially intelligent collaborative robots in the manufacturing sector can lead to a symbiotic human-robot collaboration, arising several research challenges that still need to be addressed. The goals of this paper are the following: (i) providing an overview of affective computing implementation in HRI; (ii) analyzing the state-of-art on this topic in different application contexts (e.g. healthcare, service applications, and manufacturing); (iii) highlighting research challenges for the manufacturing sector.",,Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers Part B Journal of Engineering Manufacture,,,2022-09-09,2022,2022-09-09,,,,095440542211218,Closed,Article,"Gervasi, Riccardo; Barravecchia, Federico; Mastrogiacomo, Luca; Franceschini, Fiorenzo","Gervasi, Riccardo (Department of Management and Production Engineering (DIGEP), Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy); Barravecchia, Federico (Department of Management and Production Engineering (DIGEP), Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy); Mastrogiacomo, Luca (Department of Management and Production Engineering (DIGEP), Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy); Franceschini, Fiorenzo (Department of Management and Production Engineering (DIGEP), Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy)",,"Gervasi, Riccardo (Polytechnic University of Turin); Barravecchia, Federico (Polytechnic University of Turin); Mastrogiacomo, Luca (Polytechnic University of Turin); Franceschini, Fiorenzo (Polytechnic University of Turin)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150896655,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering; 4016 Materials Engineering,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Such collaborations are deeply anchored in the vision of Society 5.0, which promotes a human-centered society that integrates virtual and physical real spaces to resolve social problems, and Industry 5.0, which promotes intelligent manufacturing processes through collaboration between humans and cyber-physical systems. It is expected that real-time H2M/R collaborations will drive new technologies that facilitate the low-latency exchange of control signals and haptic feedback between humans and machines/robots. The low-latency constraints for real-time interaction will, however, place limits on deployable distance and the flexibility of adding new machines/robots to the system. The scalability of H2M/R collaborations across large geographical distances that also allow rapid onboarding of new machines/robots is therefore an open challenge. This article focuses on global-local AI coordinated learning (GLAD), a solution framework that supports the dynamic addition of new machines/robots and their rapid onboarding. The GLAD framework is based on learning the traffic characteristics and correlation of supported robots/machines at the local edge and global cloud. Harnessing data samples from a real H2M/R application for training and validation, GLAD enables human operators to remotely control machines/robots over extended distances through accurately forecasting their haptic feedback. By globally coordinating and sharing this learning across the network, up to 72 percent of the time can be saved when onboarding new machines/robots.",,IEEE Network,,,2022-03-01,2022,,2022-03-01,36,2,124-130,Closed,Article,"Mondal, Sourav; Wong, Elaine","Mondal, Sourav (University of Melbourne, Australia); Wong, Elaine (University of Melbourne, Australia)","Mondal, Sourav (University of Melbourne)","Mondal, Sourav (University of Melbourne); Wong, Elaine (University of Melbourne)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148307178,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,

However, the increasing requirements for customized and personalized products and services, together with the acceleration of the socio-economic environment in the age of Industry 4.0, forced manufacturers to re-evaluate their current MPC strategies that mainly emphasize time, cost and quality priorities. Industry 4.0 presents a solid ambition for transforming to a digital, data-driven and interconnected manufacturing industry centred around cyber-physical convergence. Although the relevance of Industry 4.0 technologies’ disruptions on operations management has been acknowledged, a significant gap in the evolution of the logic and design of MPC systems has been observed. The requirements of on-demand products and services with enhanced flexibility, resilience, sustainability and humanitarianism in this new industrial revolution call for innovations of MPC architectures and approaches. This paper first summarizes the evolution of MPC systems with enabling technologies and the changing business climate at that time. To explore innovative MPC that complies with the increasing economic, social and environmental requirements, the concept of synchronization-oriented MPC with four principles is proposed. Following the principles, a general framework for the synchronization-oriented MPC with enhanced economic, social and environmental benefits is developed.

IIoT devices could help manufacturing companies to observe various production statuses hence improving production efficiency. However, its limitation on resources and features makes robust security implementation a big challenge. Implementing a secure, general and scalable system to adopt across industries is one of the most critical topics for IIoT. This paper proposed a blockchain-based system architecture to auto-update, monitor, and fix the IIoT devices' software. We take the software status snapshots and store them as a blockchain ledger to protect the software's integrity and the software from unauthorized modification. To achieve auto-update and auto fix, we also simulate the concept of a blockchain contract to create the ledger whenever there are changes. As a result, the changes could continuously be tracked. The performance and scalability are also evaluated. The result shows that the system could also be deployed in larger-scale IIoT devices. The software update and fix could be guaranteed authenticated, and the unauthorized software could be monitored and detected.",,,"2021 IEEE 12th Annual Information Technology, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference (IEMCON)",,2021-10-30,2021,,2021-10-30,00,,0252-0257,Closed,Proceeding,"Jang, Hung-Chin; Chen, Ying-Tzu","Jang, Hung-Chin (Dept. of Computer Science, National Chengchi University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.); Chen, Ying-Tzu (Dept. of Computer Science, National Chengchi University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.)",,"Jang, Hung-Chin (National Chengchi University); Chen, Ying-Tzu (National Chengchi University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143671431,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software; 4612 Software Engineering,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

However, the continued depletion of wild fish stocks is leading to increased strain on the aquaculture sector in terms of sustaining the supply of fish and seafood to global markets. Despite the fact that aquaculture is more diversified than other agriculture sectors, there are significant pressures on the industry to continue innovating in order to enable sustainability including increased fish production, improved appropriate selection of species, disease mitigation, reduced wastage, preventing environmental pollution and generating more employment globally. This viewpoint article addresses how digital transformation can help support and meet expansion needs of the fisheries/aquaculture industries that includes exploiting and harnessing ICT, IoT, Cloud-edge computing, AI, machine learning, immersive technologies and blockchain. Digital technologies are bringing significant operational benefits for global food chain, improving efficiencies and productivity, reducing waste, contamination and food fraud. The focus on digital technologies has recently evolved to Industry 5.0 where AI and robotics are coupled with the human mind in order to advance human-centric solutions. This viewpoint describes the role of Quadruple helix Hub (academic-industry-government and society) in delivering a convergent holistic approach to meeting the diversity of fishery industry needs by connecting and placing fisheries centrally in a defined ecosystem of stakeholders. This includes specialist training, testing technologies, providing access to finance and fostering disruption through aquaculture accelerator initiatives such as that provided by Hatch Blue. Connecting digital Innovation Hubs trans-regionally, nationally and internationally will also help mitigate against significant risks for the fisheries and aquaculture industry including climate change, global pandemics and conflicts that can jeopardize fish and seafood production and supply chains. There is also a commensurate need to avail of digital technologies in order to increase awareness of key industry issues across the value chain, such as through social marketing. Thus, addressing key challenges by way of the global digital transformation of fishery and aquaculture industry will meet several sustainable development goals of the United Nations catered around the application of disruptive technology.","The author would like to thank Interreg Atlantic Area Neptunus (Project EAPA_576/2018), MSCA RISE (ICHTHYS Project Number 872217); Regional University Network European University (RUN-EU Project), and Bord Iascaigh Mhara (Project 2019 BIM-KGS-008) for funding support.",Aquaculture and Fisheries,,,2022-07,2022,,2022-07,,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rowan, Neil J.","Rowan, Neil J.

Industry 5.0 has emerged as the next industrial revolution, to adopt a human-centric approach for digital technologies. That said, having people, robots, smart machines, and intelligent production systems working together raises challenges in terms of monitoring and securing the production environment. In other words, the complexity of smart factories makes it possible for incidents to occur and interrupt the manufacturing process. They might also cause leaking sensitive information or putting the worker’s life in danger as well. Accordingly, designing secure architectures in intelligent factories is crucial to secure a continuous production lifecycle and safe working conditions. Nonetheless, due to the decentralized environment of modern factories, creating multi-domain data correlation is crucial to obtain universal monitoring of the occurring events, as well as to establish cyber situational awareness and adopt suitable countermeasures in case of attacks. For these purposes, we developed a holistic multi-domain security and safety mechanism for Factories of the Future. Our approach consists of individual but integrated modules, each of which is responsible for capturing alerts from different domains of the factory. Alerts are then handled by an intelligent correlator to inspect possible attacks or malfunctions on the investigated shop floor.

Despite the constant development of improved communication protocols and standards during Industry 4.0, the latency problem persists, lowering quality of services (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE). Tactile internet (TI), with its high availability, security, and ultra-low latency, will add a new dimension to human-machine interaction (HMI) by enabling haptic and tactile sensations. The tactile internet (TI) is a cutting-edge technology that uses 5G and beyond (B5G) communications to enable real-time interaction of haptic data over the internet between tactile ends. This emerging TI technology is regarded as the next evolutionary step for the Internet of Things (IoT) and is expected to bring about massive changes towards Society 5.0 and to address complex issues in current society. To that end, the 5G mobile communication systems will support the TI at the wireless edge. As a result, TI can be used as a backbone for delay mitigation in conjunction with 5G networks, allowing for ultra-reliable low latency applications like Smart Manufacturing, virtual reality, and augmented reality. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to present the current state of 5G and TI, as well as the challenges and future trends for 5G networks beyond 2021, as well as a conceptual framework for integrating 5G and TI into existing industrial case studies, with a focus on the design aspects and layers of TI, such as the master, network, and slave layers.

In today’s modern world, societies are utterly attached to internet and technologies to access more information, switching the traditional modes of communication to virtual – all at large scale simultaneously. Governments are using advanced innovative technologies to provide end-to-end integrated public services e.g. in the form of electronic government (e-Government); nevertheless, how effective and efficient their communication with public society are and where citizens engagement has been considered to deliver the services – these still remain unexplored. This developing paper is considering Industry 4.0 (I4.0), Society 5.0 (S5.0), sustainability and circular economy in order to review the impact of I4.0 on manufacturing, what various governments planned to adopt I4.0 technologies within public services and direct communication with citizens.

Majority of these changes affect Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, shifting them to a higher level of interoperability, heterogeneous networks, big data and toward internet technologies and services in general. However, this transformation does not affect all SCADA systems equally. The immediate industrial environment and controlled processes have a significant impact as well. This paper presents a holistic approach to SCADA systems implemented in continuous flow production control within the steel industry production environment. We outline the multi-layer architecture of the SCADA control framework and the aspects of interoperability and interconnectivity within the architecture reference models, together with the research challenges and opportunities arising from the recent rapid increasement of the industrial control systems complexity and digital transformation under the Industry 4.0 paradigm, resulting in disrupting levels of the traditional automation pyramid based on Purdue model toward a higher level of integration and interoperability enabling cross-level data exchange empowered by the Industrial Internet of Things.

In this scenario, Society 5.0 (S5.0) is arising as a new paradigm that places humans at the centre of innovation. To foster the effective integration of technology into society and to better understand how to design S5.0 configurations and solutions, the authors developed a conceptual model applying the Design Thinking (DT) approach to the Quintuple Helix (QH) innovation framework. The proposed QH–DT model was found to be suitable for allowing the knowledge flow among the actors involved in the design and implementation of the S5.0 solution.

For example, IIoT devices are deployed in factories to help the manufacturing companies (e.g., automotive) gain in-depth insight into the various states of production, and thus improving production efficiency and achieving cost reductions. However, malicious code may compromise IIoT devices if either the devices are exposed to outside or unexposed inner devices are updated unauthentically. Due to their limited resources and features, it is challenging to implement strong security solutions for such embedded devices. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based software status monitoring system, called BoSMoS. The system is designed to monitor the software status of IIoT devices to detect and respond to identified malicious behaviors (e.g., intrusions). BoSMoS takes a snapshot of the statue of monitored software and monitors its file system calls. In order to ensure the software integrity information, we use blockchain as the distributed ledger to store a snapshot of software status. The blockchain network of BoSMoS can employ different consensus algorithms. We also evaluate the performance of BoSMoS, in terms of exception response delay, resistance performance to various intrusions, and scalability. The experimental results justify that BoSMoS is practical and sound. In addition, the evaluation of scalability and security demonstrates that the system can carry deployment of large-scale IIoT devices and can guarantee authenticated software updating, as well as detect unauthorized software status.","This work was supported in part by the Major Scientific and Technological Special Project of Guizhou Province under Grant 20183001, the Open Funding of Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Public Big Data under Grant 2018BDKFJJ009 and Grant 2017BDKFJJ006, and the Open Funding of Hubei Provincial Key Laboratory of Intelligent Geo-Information Processing under Grant KLIGIP2016A05.",IEEE Internet of Things Journal,,,2019-10-15,2019,2019-10-15,2020-02-01,7,2,948-959,Closed,Article,"He, Sen; Ren, Wei; Zhu, Tianqing; Choo, Kim-Kwang Raymond","He, Sen (School of Computer Science, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, 430074, China); Ren, Wei (School of Computer Science, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, 430074, China); Zhu, Tianqing (School of Software, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, NSW, 2007, Australia); Choo, Kim-Kwang Raymond (Department of Information Systems and Cyber Security, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, 78249, USA)","Ren, Wei (China University of Geosciences)","He, Sen (China University of Geosciences); Ren, Wei (China University of Geosciences); Zhu, Tianqing (University of Technology Sydney); Choo, Kim-Kwang Raymond (The University of Texas at San Antonio)",35,28,,15.41,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1121839254,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software; 4612 Software Engineering,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The shopbots were proposed in Industry 4.0 where the more focus was on process automation. In this research work, we propose recommender system for industry 5.0 which is based on collaboration of human beings and machines with more focus on user’s personalization. Recommender system can be considered as an information filtering tool that provides suggestions to users about products, music, friend, topic, etc. This suggestion is based on the interest of users. Several research works have been carried out to improve recommendation accuracy by using matrix factorization, trust-based, hybrid-based, machine learning, and deep learning techniques. However, very few existing works have leveraged textual opinions for the recommendation to the best of our knowledge. Existing research works have focused only on numerical ratings, which do not reflect actual user behaviour. In this research work, sentiments of textual opinions are analysed for an in-depth analysis of user’s behaviour. Recommendation accuracy is improved by using the proposed score Recop which is calculated from opinion sentiments. Furthermore, the sparsity issue is resolved by using our proposed approach. Amazon and Yelp review datasets are used for Experiment analysis. Mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values are improved significantly using the proposed approach compared to the existing approaches. MAE and RMSE scores on the Yelp dataset are 0.85 and 1.51, respectively. Additionally, MAE and RMSE scores on the Amazon dataset are 0.66 and 0.93, respectively, which clearly reflects the significant contribution of our proposed approach.",,Soft Computing,,,2021-12-01,2021,2021-12-01,,,,1-10,Closed,Article,"Bathla, Gourav; Singh, Pardeep; Kumar, Sunil; Verma, Madhushi; Garg, Deepak; Kotecha, Ketan","Bathla, Gourav (School of Computer Science, University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, India); Singh, Pardeep (School of Computer Science, University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, India); Kumar, Sunil (School of Computer Science, University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, India); Verma, Madhushi (Department of Computer Science Engineering, Bennett University, Greater Noida, India); Garg, Deepak (Department of Computer Science Engineering, Bennett University, Greater Noida, India); Kotecha, Ketan (Symbiosis Centre for Applied Artificial Intelligence, Symbiosis International (Deemed University), Pune, India)","Kotecha, Ketan (Symbiosis International University)","Bathla, Gourav (University of Petroleum and Energy Studies); Singh, Pardeep (University of Petroleum and Energy Studies); Kumar, Sunil (University of Petroleum and Energy Studies); Verma, Madhushi (Bennett University); Garg, Deepak (Bennett University); Kotecha, Ketan (Symbiosis International University)",4,4,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143541891,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,

759,pub.1147301491,10.3233/atde220170,,,The Schematization of XR Technologies in the Context of Collaborative Design,"Recently, the concept of Industry 5.0 has been introduced to complement, among other things, Industry 4.0’s focus on efficiency and productivity with a focus on humans in digital design and production processes. The inclusion of human interaction with digital realities, extended reality (XR) technologies, such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), can play an essential role in Industry 5.0. While rapid advances in XR technologies are solidifying and finding their place in the product and production development process, terminology and classification scheme remain under-determined. As a result, there have been numerous classifications of XR technologies from different perspectives, but little widespread agreement. They have been classified by their level of immersion or how well they meet a specific purpose (such as training). In addition to that, the classifications are usually made for one particular field (e.g. marketing, healthcare, engineering, architecture, among others). Therefore, to set the basis for future research, it is essential to identify and outline the dimensions that intervene in product and production design in regards to XR facilitated collaboration. With the ideas proposed in this paper, we want to identify basic concepts that classify a collaborative XR system by analyzing how users interact with the environment and other users. Our motivation is that collaborative design involves not only the physical dimension but also a social dimension. Defining when an XR system contributes to increasing social and/or physical presence could clarify and simplify its categorization.",,Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering,SPS2022,,2022-04-20,2022,2022-04-20,,,,,All OA; Gold,Chapter,"Garcia Rivera, Francisco; Lamb, Maurice; Högberg, Dan; Brolin, Anna","Garcia Rivera, Francisco (School of Engineering Science, University of Skövde, Skövde, Sweden); Lamb, Maurice (School of Engineering Science, University of Skövde, Skövde, Sweden); Högberg, Dan (School of Engineering Science, University of Skövde, Skövde, Sweden); Brolin, Anna (School of Engineering Science, University of Skövde, Skövde, Sweden)",,"Garcia Rivera, Francisco (University of Skövde); Lamb, Maurice (University of Skövde); Högberg, Dan (University of Skövde); Brolin, Anna (University of Skövde)",0,0,,,https://ebooks.iospress.nl/pdf/doi/10.3233/ATDE220170,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147301491,33 Built Environment and Design; 3303 Design; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Digital green innovation (DGI) has gradually become the mainstream paradigm of innovation. How to achieve a balance between a local DGI network (LDGIN) and a remote DGI network (RDGIN) and how to use the role of digital empowerment and green organization flexibility to improve the performance of DGI are very important issues facing manufacturing enterprises at present. However, this problem has not been fully addressed in the existing research. In this study, the influence mechanism of LDGIN and RDGIN on the DGI performance of manufacturing enterprises was revealed, considering the moderating role of digital empowerment and green organization flexibility. The linear regression method was used to analyze the 562 valid data obtained by questionnaire survey. The results of this study are as follows. The effect of the DGI network on manufacturing enterprises’ DGI performance is heterogeneous because of LDGIN and RDGIN. The establishment of embedded links in a DGI network inevitably requires manufacturing enterprises to pay the corresponding costs. The over-embedding of manufacturing enterprises into RDGIN will have a negative impact on DGI performance. The balance between LDGIN and RDGIN has an important impact on manufacturing enterprises’ operation. The comprehensive balance and relative balance indexes constructed in this paper show that an appropriate balance can promote the improvement of the DGI performance of manufacturing enterprises. Digital transformation and organizational structure innovation are changing the business model of manufacturing enterprises and can regulate the relationship between the LDGIN and RDGIN and the DGI performance of manufacturing enterprises. The balance of DGI network embedding in practice shows the important role and enlightening significance of local and remote search in developing countries.",,Systems,,,2022-07-05,2022,2022-07-05,,10,4,97,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hu, Chengli; Yang, Hongtao; Yin, Shi","Hu, Chengli (); Yang, Hongtao (); Yin, Shi ()",,"Hu, Chengli (); Yang, Hongtao (); Yin, Shi ()",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-8954/10/4/97/pdf?version=1657172626,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149287907,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

A deep look at disruptive technology and innovation in retail highlights the diversity of the future of food safety technology. Food systems and food supply chains (FSCs) have undergone significant changes in their operations and structure over the last decade as globalization expands both food choice and availability. As FSCs lengthen, and food passes through extended trading relationships, transparency on food origins, methods of cultivation, harvest, processing as well as labor conditions and sustainability are reduced, along with food trust. Moreover, while the rapid pace of technology innovation benefits FSCs, we are witness to the usage of social media platforms by citizen-consumers to amplify the rhetoric related to recurring incidents and crises in food quality, food safety, food fraud, food security, sustainability, and other ethical lapses. Furthermore, we are witness to new evidence on the global burden of foodborne diseases, including noncommunicable diseases that range from severe malnutrition to morbid obesity and from severe illnesses requiring hospitalization to mortality. The World Health Organization claims that 31 foodborne hazards cause 600 million illnesses and 420,000 deaths annually. Overcoming these challenges requires a holistic reframing of our food systems and societal challenges. The emergence of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provides an overarching framework for collaboration and alignment. Japan has put forward a vision for a human-centric, technology-enabled future branded as “Society 5.0.” Increasingly, the redesign of FSCs necessitates a concerted, multistakeholder effort and the development of digitization strategies in order to cope with the evolution toward the vision of Society 5.0 and to achieve the UN SDGs.",,,Building the Future of Food Safety Technology,,2020,2020,,2020,,,1-42,Closed,Chapter,"Zimmer, Gennette; Keogh, John G.; Dube, Laurette; Rejeb, Abderahman; Hand, Karen J.; Khan, Nida; Dean, Kevin; Wogan, Ed","Zimmer, Gennette (Data Analytics, Boston University, Boston, MA, United States); Keogh, John G.

In seeking to address such challenges, this research adopts a human-centric perspective to define new flexible job arrangements by developing a new multi-objective job rotation scheduling model. The proposed model is unique in that it aims to achieve multiple job assignment objectives by simultaneously considering different socio-technical factors: workers' experience, physical capacity and limitations, postural ergonomic risks, noise and vibration exposure, and workers' boredom. The model's implementation in real environments can be supported by new sensor-based technologies that collect data on workers' efficiency, ergonomic scores and task performance and enable workers to participate in measuring perceived fatigue and boredom.

Since it is heavily involved in rising power generation and transmission, distributed generation research understanding is growing. The complex, crucial situation between renewable and industrial customers for energy production and distribution in a privatized energy distribution environment uses “Smart Energy” and “Smart Power Generation” to convey a wider concept than the word “Smart Grid”. Although Smart Utilities are mainly based on the energy field, the interconnected systemic focus of Smart Energy Solutions is on the integration of multiple industries (power generation, warming, freezing, manufacturing, dwellings, and shipping) and facilitates the detection of more feasible and accessible technologies for the transition into potential solutions for sustainable and renewable energy. An innovative model for offering a holistic and integrated solution for a feasible, efficient, and reliable energy system is perceived to be smart electricity systems that incorporate multiple energy industries in the future. Smart energy mitigation has been regarded as a way of enhancing energy efficiency and reducing global gas emissions in enterprises on the policy framework. The most important unique measure of the Energy Framework is designed for industrial energy conservation. Although it is heavily entangled in rising energy production and transmission due to demand‐side management, research understanding is growing. That's the complex crucial situation for energy supply and management between utilities and industrial customers in a deregulated power marketing environment. The topology of the smart grid maintains the capacity for power consumption to focus on providing globally competitive infrastructure. Power Energy uses control steps to protect the energy system in spite of the use of energy. The energy consumption control concept is being used in this chapter to effectively control demands by using the smart grid for manufacturing industries. This also offers a description and statistical method of the specific demands of manufacturing customers with regard to implications of the energy consumption of an economic power system. This policy offers industrialized customers with an enticing opportunity to reduce pressures on services and sensibly control them during times of energy shortage, resulting in the maximum peak usage that runs off‐peak.

Basically, the evolutionary approach is used in the version of cyclic genetic dynamics. To assess the long-term effects of the “path dependence”, we analyze the 150-year cycle of industrialization within the borders of Historical Russia. To do this, we use the mechanisms of spatial localization of Kondratiev cycles and associated technological structures of the first (first-second), second (third-fourth)) and the third (fifth) industrial revolution. As an information base, data on the number of people employed and the volume of industrial production (in comparable prices) are used, and for the XX century, data on the dynamics of fixed assets of industry are also used. The relationship between modernization schemes on the old basis (within the boundaries of old industrial areas) and in the areas of pioneer development is revealed. The stability of industry specializations within the grid of industrial areas is considered separately. Based on the results obtained, the conclusion is made about the stability of old industrial cores of localization of industrial potential, the continuity of the spectrum of their specializations (not the replacement of old industries with new ones, but the addition).

To some extent several companies have embarked Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0 within Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Through the wave of IoT Technology, Industries are adopting automated machinery. Predictive maintenance (PM) is indispensable not only toward the machines” vitality and longevity purpose, but also toward the human error reduction. This paper elaborates its discourse of Industry 4.0 and Society through the lens of CBM and MLAI. The mentioned Machine Learning, in this paper, refers to research methodology, as methodological frameworks. Those frameworks comprise several phases, which are: 1. Equipment Analysis; 2. Data Evaluation; 3. Data Selection and Process; 4. Modeling; 5. Decision Support Model Evaluation. The MLAI techniques are based upon the identification of behaviour patterns. This identification comprises datasets that exclude mathematical models or prior historical knowledge. The discourse in this paper intertwines CBM process and MLAI through data cleaning and processing, features stratification and extraction, model stratification and validation. This paper elaborates two renowned maintenance approaches which are preventive and corrective maintenance. Discourse in this paper focuses on corrective action, known as predictive maintenance (PM), or condition based maintenance (CBM) within Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM). CBM is chosen as the most desirable strategy, as it involves the intervention as the consequence of the machine breakdown. It also provides cost savings toward spare parts consumption, and optimizes production.",,IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering,,,2020-07-01,2020,,2020-07-01,852,1,012022,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rahman, Abdul; Pasaribu, Elias; Nugraha, Yudhiana; Khair, Fauzi; Soebandrija, Khristian Edi Nugroho; Wijaya, Dendhy Indra","Rahman, Abdul (Industrial Engineering Department, BINUS Online Learning, Bina Nusantara University, Jakarta, Indonesia 11480); Pasaribu, Elias (Industrial Engineering Department, BINUS Online Learning, Bina Nusantara University, Jakarta, Indonesia 11480); Nugraha, Yudhiana (Industrial Engineering Department, BINUS Online Learning, Bina Nusantara University, Jakarta, Indonesia 11480); Khair, Fauzi (Industrial Engineering Department, BINUS Online Learning, Bina Nusantara University, Jakarta, Indonesia 11480); Soebandrija, Khristian Edi Nugroho (Industrial Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, Bina Nusantara University, Jakarta, Indonesia 11480; Management Department, BINUS Business School, Doctor of Research in Management Bina Nusantara University, Jakarta, Indonesia 11480; Knugroho@binus.edu; Khristian.DRM@gmail.com); Wijaya, Dendhy Indra (Industrial Engineering Department, BINUS Online Learning, Bina Nusantara University, Jakarta, Indonesia 11480)",,"Rahman, Abdul (Binus University); Pasaribu, Elias (Binus University); Nugraha, Yudhiana (Binus University); Khair, Fauzi (Binus University); Soebandrija, Khristian Edi Nugroho (Binus University; Binus University); Wijaya, Dendhy Indra (Binus University)",3,3,,1.51,https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899x/852/1/012022,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129501191,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"
732,pub.1130110501,10.3390/app10165625,,,Concensus-Based ALADIN Method to Faster the Decentralized Estimation of Laplacian Spectrum,"With the upcoming fifth Industrial Revolution, humans and collaborative robots will dance together in production. They themselves act as an agent in a connected world, understood as a multi-agent system, in which the Laplacian spectrum plays an important role since it can define the connection of the complex networks as well as depict the robustness. In addition, the Laplacian spectrum can locally check the controllability and observability of a dynamic controlled network, etc. This paper presents a new method, which is based on the Augmented Lagrange based Alternating Direction Inexact Newton (ALADIN) method, to faster the convergence rate of the Laplacian Spectrum Estimation via factorization of the average consensus matrices, that are expressed as Laplacian-based matrices problems. Herein, the non-zero distinct Laplacian eigenvalues are the inverse of the stepsizes {αt,t=1,2,…} of those matrices. Therefore, the problem now is to carry out the agreement on the stepsize values for all agents in the given network while ensuring the factorization of average consensus matrices to be accomplished. Furthermore, in order to obtain the entire Laplacian spectrum, it is necessary to estimate the relevant multiplicities of these distinct eigenvalues. Consequently, a non-convex optimization problem is formed and solved using ALADIN method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated through the simulation results and the comparison with the Lagrange-based method in advance.",,Applied Sciences,,,2020-08-13,2020,2020-08-13,,10,16,5625,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tran, Thi-Minh-Dung; An, Luu Ngoc; Doan, Ngoc Chi Nam","Tran, Thi-Minh-Dung (The Faculty of Electrical Engineering, The University of Danang—University of Science and Technology, 54 Nguyen Luong Bang Street, Danang City 550000, Vietnam;, lnan@dut.udn.vn); An, Luu Ngoc (The Faculty of Electrical Engineering, The University of Danang—University of Science and Technology, 54 Nguyen Luong Bang Street, Danang City 550000, Vietnam;, lnan@dut.udn.vn); Doan, Ngoc Chi Nam (Manufacturing Execution and Control Group, Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology, Singapore 138634, Singapore;, doanncn@SIMTech.a-star.edu.sg)","Tran, Thi-Minh-Dung ","Tran, Thi-Minh-Dung (); An, Luu Ngoc (); Doan, Ngoc Chi Nam (Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology)",1,1,,0.59,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/16/5625/pdf?version=1597918909,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130110501,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence,

Among other things, planners are dissatisfied with the way PPC systems present information and results. As a result, there is a risk that the number of errors due to misinterpretations will increase. These are primarily caused by Cognitive Biases. Even increasing automation will not change this, since according to experts, humans will remain central, especially in decision-making. The European Union points out that Industry 4.0 focuses more on technical feasibility and implementation and less on human needs. In response, it proposes the human-centered approach of Industry 5.0. Here, the human being should move to the center of the process. In this regard, there is still little research activity in the field of PPC and in the context of Cognitive Biases. Therefore, we want to take a first step towards the human-centered approach with this work. To this end, we conduct a systematic literature review and develop a questionnaire to determine the human-centered maturity level.

This paper provides a novel study focused on the human aspects involved in industrial HRC by exploring the effects of various HRC setting factors. In particular, this paper aims at investigating the impact of industrial HRC on user experience, affective state, and stress, assessed through both subjective measures (i.e., questionnaires) and objective ones (i.e., physiological signals). A collaborative assembly task was implemented with different configurations, in which the robot movement speed, the distance between the operator and the robot workspace, and the control of the task execution time were varied. Forty-two participants were involved in the study and provided feedbacks on interaction quality and their affective state. Participants’ physiological responses (i.e., electrodermal activity and heart rate) were also collected non-invasively to monitor the amount of stress generated by the interaction. Analysis of both subjective and objective responses revealed how the configuration factors considered influence them. Robot movement speed and control of the task execution time resulted to be the most influential factors. The results also showed the need for customization of HRC to improve ergonomics, both psychological and physical, and the well-being of the operator.",,Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems,,,2022-09-23,2022,2022-09-23,2022-10,106,2,36,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Gervasi, Riccardo; Aliev, Khurshid; Mastrogiacomo, Luca; Franceschini, Fiorenzo","Gervasi, Riccardo (Department of Management and Production Engineering (DIGEP), Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy); Aliev, Khurshid (Department of Management and Production Engineering (DIGEP), Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy); Mastrogiacomo, Luca (Department of Management and Production Engineering (DIGEP), Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy); Franceschini, Fiorenzo (Department of Management and Production Engineering (DIGEP), Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy)","Gervasi, Riccardo (Polytechnic University of Turin)","Gervasi, Riccardo (Polytechnic University of Turin); Aliev, Khurshid (Polytechnic University of Turin); Mastrogiacomo, Luca (Polytechnic University of Turin); Franceschini, Fiorenzo (Polytechnic University of Turin)",0,0,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10846-022-01744-8.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151300941,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The hardware architecture consists of the A/D/RML and a six-workstation (WS) mechatronics line (ML) connected to a flexible cell (FC) and equipped with a six-degree of freedom (DOF) industrial robotic manipulator (IRM). The CAS has in its structure two driving wheels and one free wheel (2DW/1FW)-wheeled mobile robot (WMR) equipped with a 7-DOF robotic manipulator (RM). On the end effector of the RM, a mobile visual servoing system (eye-in-hand MVSS) is mounted. The multifunctionality is provided by the three actions, assembly, disassembly, and repair, while the flexibility is due to the assembly of different products. After disassembly or repair, CAS picks up the disassembled components and transports them to the appropriate storage depots for reuse. Disassembling or repairing starts after assembling, and the final assembled product fails the quality test. The virtual world that serves as the digital counterpart consists of tasks assignment, planning and synchronization of A/D/RML with integrated robotic systems, IRM, and CAS. Additionally, the virtual world includes hybrid modeling with synchronized hybrid Petri nets (SHPN), simulation of the SHPN models, modeling of the MVSS, and simulation of the trajectory-tracking sliding-mode control (TTSMC) of the CAS. The real world, as counterpart of the digital twin, consists of communication, synchronization, and control of A/D/RML and CAS. In addition, the real world includes control of the MVSS, the inverse kinematic control (IKC) of the RM and graphic user interface (GUI) for monitoring and real-time control of the whole system. The “Digital twin” approach has been designed to meet all the requirements and attributes of Industry 4.0 and beyond towards Industry 5.0, the target being a closer collaboration between the human operator and the production line.",,Sensors,,,2022-10-25,2022,2022-10-25,,22,21,8153,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mincă, Eugenia; Filipescu, Adrian; Cernega, Daniela; Șolea, Răzvan; Filipescu, Adriana; Ionescu, Dan; Simion, Georgian","Mincă, Eugenia (); Filipescu, Adrian (); Cernega, Daniela (); Șolea, Răzvan (); Filipescu, Adriana (); Ionescu, Dan (); Simion, Georgian ()",,"Mincă, Eugenia (); Filipescu, Adrian (); Cernega, Daniela (); Șolea, Răzvan (); Filipescu, Adriana (); Ionescu, Dan (); Simion, Georgian ()",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/21/8153/pdf?version=1666688965,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152249958,"40 Engineering; 4007 Control Engineering, Mechatronics and Robotics; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence","9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

This pushes us towards the hybridization of manufacturing plants promoting a full collaboration between humans and robots. However, there are currently very few workplaces where effective Human–Robot Collaboration takes place. Layout designing plays a key role in assuring safe and efficient Human–Robot Collaboration. The layout design, especially in the context of collaborative robotics, is a complex problem to face, since it is related to safety, ergonomics, and productivity aspects. In the current work, a Knowledge-Based Approach (KBA) is adopted to face the complexity of the layout design problem. The framework resulting from the KBA allows for developing a modeling paradigm that enables us to define a streamlined approach for the layout design. The proposed approach allows for placing resource within the workplace according to a defined optimization criterion, and also ensures compliance with various standards. This approach is applied to an industrial case study in order to prove its feasibility. A what-if analysis is performed by applying the proposed approach. Changing three control factors (i.e., minimum distance, robot speed, logistic space configuration) on three levels, in a Design of Experiments, 27 layout configurations of the same workplace are generated. Consequently, the inputs that most affect the layout design are identified by means of an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The results show that only one layout is eligible to be the best configuration, and only two out of three control factors are very significant for the designing of the HRC workplace layout. Hence, the proposed approach enables the designing of standard compliant and optimized HRC workplace layouts. Therefore, several alternatives of the layout for the same workplace can be easily generated and investigated in a systematic manner.",,Applied Sciences,,,2021-12-20,2021,2021-12-20,,11,24,12147,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rega, Andrea; Di Marino, Castrese; Pasquariello, Agnese; Vitolo, Ferdinando; Patalano, Stanislao; Zanella, Alessandro; Lanzotti, Antonio","Rega, Andrea (); Di Marino, Castrese (); Pasquariello, Agnese (); Vitolo, Ferdinando (); Patalano, Stanislao (); Zanella, Alessandro (); Lanzotti, Antonio ()",,"Rega, Andrea (); Di Marino, Castrese (); Pasquariello, Agnese (); Vitolo, Ferdinando (); Patalano, Stanislao (); Zanella, Alessandro (); Lanzotti, Antonio ()",4,4,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/24/12147/pdf?version=1640163209,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144075707,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Recent advances in AR technology have facilitated the development of more intuitive user interfaces for many human-robot interaction applications. While it has been anticipated that AR can provide a more intuitive interface to robot assistants helping human workers in various manufacturing scenarios, existing studies in robotics have been largely limited to teleoperation and programming. Industry 5.0 envisions cooperation between human and robot working in teams. Indeed, there exist many industrial tasks that can benefit from human-robot collaboration. A prime example is high-value composite manufacturing. Working with our industry partner towards this example application, we evaluated our AR interface design for shared physical workspace collaboration in human-robot teams. We conducted a multi-dimensional analysis of our interface using established metrics. Results from our user study (n = 26) show that, subjectively, the AR interface feels more novel and a standard joystick interface feels more dependable to users. However, the AR interface was found to reduce physical demand and task completion time, while increasing robot utilization. Furthermore, user’s freedom of choice to collaborate with the robot may also affect the perceived usability of the system.",,ACM Transactions on Human-Robot Interaction,,,2022-09-30,2022,,2022-09-30,11,3,1-19,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Chan, Wesley P.; Hanks, Geoffrey; Sakr, Maram; Zhang, Haomiao; Zuo, Tiger; van der Loos, H.

Nowadays, several authors discuss the need to bring workers back to the center of the decision-making about implementing the new technologies in what is being called Industry 5.0 (I5.0). A key factor of using these new concepts is that it must make sense, and the new information generated by these technologies must have a precise use; otherwise, it will be considered waste. The Lean approach is already recognized as the best approach to identify and eliminate waste from production systems. Not only that, but it allows decisions about process improvement to be human-centric. Thus, this article aims to present the main aspects and evolution of I4.0 and I5.0 over time, using the Lean approach as the analysis lenses.
 Study design/methodology/approach: In order to identify the mains aspects of I4.0 and I5.0, we develop a consistent literature review using the Systematic Search Flow (SSF).
 Findings: As a result, it was possible to identify the evolution from I4.0 to I5.0, In I4.0, the main focus was on developing new technologies, combine them with classic Lean tools (e.g. Kanban 4.0, Poka-Yoke 4.0) and implement Cyber-Physical Systems. In I5.0, the focus is to use these new technologies together with shop floor workers to continuously improve production processes. Not only that, but in I5.0, the protagonist becomes (or return to become) the shop floor workers to lead the improvements, as is in the Toyota Kata approach.
 Originality/value: This work presents a new way of interpreting the progression of concepts from I4.0 to I5.0. In addition, the focus on workers for problem solving is returning to the center of the discussion.

It is actually significant that the global system involves a multidimensional and technology-driven structure and that national-states’ regulations occur along with transnational practices.

New technologies consist of some innovations such as artificial intelligence, robotics, big data, internet of things, cloud technology, and so on, that describe the concept of ‘Society 5.0’ proposed by Japan and the concept of ‘Industry 4.0’ proposed by Germany. These technologies create super smart society in terms of their impacts on improving human life. Smart technologies improve human life in the fields of education, health, security, etc. On the other hand, smart technologies used in the process of production shape the global production network and the innovative strategies of firms. It is required that new technologies should not be remained uncontrolled within the logic of ‘laissez faire’ because their impacts and power are so great. Thus, national-states should make efficient economic policies by also considering transnational practices; like that Japan and Germany develop their own national view in terms of Society 5.0 and Industry 4.0.

682,pub.1112995149,10.1109/hri.2019.8673139,,,Consider the Human Work Experience When Integrating Robotics in the Workplace,"Worldwide, manufacturers are reimagining the future of their workforce and its connection to technology. Rather than replacing humans, Industry 5.0 explores how humans and robots can best complement one another's unique strengths. However, realizing this vision requires an in-depth understanding of how workers view the positive and negative attributes of their jobs, and the place of robots within it. In this paper, we explore the relationship between work attributes and automation goals by engaging in field research at a manufacturing plant. We conducted 50 face-to-face interviews with assembly-line workers $(\mathrm{n}=50)$, which we analyzed using discourse analysis and social constructivist methods. We found that the work attributes deemed most positive by participants include social interaction, movement and exercise, (human) autonomy, problem solving, task variety, and building with their hands. The main negative work attributes included health and safety issues, feeling rushed, and repetitive work. We identified several ways robots could help reduce negative work attributes and enhance positive ones, such as reducing work interruptions and cultivating physical and psychological well-being. Based on our findings, we created a set of integration considerations for organizations planning to deploy robotics technology, and discuss how the manufacturing and HRI communities can explore these ideas in the future.",This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. IIP-1724982.

A deep understanding of the work environment and organization is important to start analysing the working conditions and the resulting User eXperience (UX) of the operators. Also, the knowledge about users’ needs and ergonomics is fundamental to optimize the workers’ wellbeing, working conditions, and industrial results. In this context, the paper presents a strategy to effectively assess the UX of workers to promote human-centric vision of manufacturing sites, enhancing the overall sustainability of the modern factories. A set of non-invasive wearable devices is used to monitor human activities and collect physiological parameters, as well as questionnaires to gather subjective self-assessment. This set-up was applied to virtual reality (VR) simulation, replicating heavy duty work sequence tasks that took place in an oil and gas pipes manufacturing site. This approach allowed the identification of possible stressful conditions for the operator, from physical and mental perspectives, which may compromise the performance.

657,pub.1141295492,10.5772/intechopen.98677,,,Advanced Composites with Aluminum Alloys Matrix and Their Fabrication Processes,"This chapter introduces advanced aluminum alloy matrix composites and their manufacturing processes. In the beginning, the state of the art is characterized and the general characteristics of aluminum and its practical applications are presented, starting with the history of aluminum. The current approximate distribution of bauxite resources in the world and the production of bauxite and alumina in the leading countries of the world, as well as the production of primary and secondary aluminum and the range of aluminum end products, are presented. Aluminum alloys intended for plastic deformation and castings, and composite materials in general and with a matrix of aluminum alloys in particular, have been characterized in general. Against this background, a detailed review of the results of the Author’s own research included in numerous projects and own publications on advanced composite materials, their production technology, their structure, and properties were done. The range of aluminum alloy matrices of composite materials was adequately characterized, which include AlSi12, AlSi7Mg0.3, AlMg1SiCu, AlMg3, AlMg5, and AlMg9, respectively. Composite materials tested in terms of manufacturing technology include three groups. The first group includes gas pressure infiltration with liquid aluminum alloys of suitably formed porous preforms. Porous frameworks as a reinforcement for pressure-infiltrated composite materials with a matrix of aluminum alloys are produced by three methods. Al2O3 powder with the addition of 30–50% carbon fibers is uniaxially pressed, sintered, and heated to thermally degrade the carbon fibers and create the required pore sizes. In the second case, the ceramic porous skeleton is produced with the use of halloysite nanotubes HNTs by mechanical milling, press consolidation, and sintering. A third method is SLS selective laser sintering using titanium powders. Another group of manufacturing technologies is the mechanical synthesis of the mixture of AlMg1SiCu aluminum alloy powder and respectively, halloysite nanotubes HNTs in a volume fraction from 5 to 15% or multi-wall carbon nanotubes MWCNTs in a volume fraction from 0.5 to 5%, and subsequent consolidation involving plastic deformation. The third group of analyzed materials concerns composite surface layers on substrates of aluminum alloys produced by laser feathering of WC/W2C or SiC carbides. The structure and properties of the mentioned composite materials with aluminum alloys matrices are described in detail. The chapter summary provides final remarks on the importance of advanced aluminum alloy composite materials in industrial development. The importance of particular groups of engineering materials in the history and the development of the methodology for the selection of engineering materials, including the current stage of Materials 4.0, was emphasized. The importance of material design in engineering design is emphasized. Concepts of the development of societies were presented: Society 5.0 and Industry 4.0. The own concept of a holistic model of the extended Industry 4.0 was presented, taking into account advanced engineering materials and technological processes. Particular attention was paid to the importance of advanced composite materials with an aluminum alloy matrix in the context of the current stage of Industry 4.0 of the industrial revolution. Growth in the production of aluminum, its alloys, and composites with its matrix was compared with that of steel. Despite the 30 times less production, aluminum is important due to its lower density. The challenges posed by the development in the Industry 4.0 stage, including the expectations of the automotive and aviation industry, force constant progress in the development of new materials with the participation of aluminum, including the composite materials with an aluminum alloy matrix presented in this chapter.",,,Advanced Aluminium Composites and Alloys,,2021-10-06,2021,2021-10-06,,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Chapter,"A.

Many studies on DTs focus on industrial applications. However, DT technology has potential for implementation of digital labs in education. This aspect of DTs is of rising importance as distance education has increased over the last decade and access to physical laboratories can be restricted due to factors such as the Covid-19 pandemic. Thus, there is a need to study the use of DT technology in higher education. To address this, we investigate possibilities and challenges of applying DT technology in education to conduct industrial-like labs virtually. A case of an automation line, with full scale industrial equipment, based at a research center, is focused. Results emphasize that the application of DT technologies require multi-domain expertise to understand the consequences of every single decision in the design process on every piece of equipment involved, making the modelling process complex and time consuming. Thus, when applied in education, test procedures need to be designed to focus on students’ motivation, improved learning and understanding of production systems. DTs are considered enabling technologies supporting the concept of Industry 5.0, thus stressing the human-centric aspects of advancing Industry 4.0. The predicted application of DTs emphasizes the need for educational curricula that include laboratory applications and theoretic understanding of DT technologies. This study focusses the application of DT technologies in higher education curricula, but the result of the study can contribute to other areas such as automation and virtual commissioning towards smarter manufacturing.",,Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering,SPS2022,,2022-04-20,2022,2022-04-20,,,,,All OA; Gold,Chapter,"Eriksson, Kristina; Alsaleh, Abdlkarim; Behzad Far, Shervin; Stjern, David","Eriksson, Kristina (University West, Trollhättan, Sweden); Alsaleh, Abdlkarim (University West, Trollhättan, Sweden); Behzad Far, Shervin (Northvolt, Sweden); Stjern, David (University West, Trollhättan, Sweden)",,"Eriksson, Kristina (University West); Alsaleh, Abdlkarim (University West); Behzad Far, Shervin (Northvolt (Sweden)); Stjern, David (University West)",0,0,,,https://ebooks.iospress.nl/pdf/doi/10.3233/ATDE220165,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147301486,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,"4 Quality Education; 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The area of AI is an interdisciplinary field, which has been designated as a strategic area in the European Union (EU) approach and a key driver of economic development that can bring solutions to many social challenges and problems. Due to its nature and its tendency to be digitally advanced and smarter with analytics, the financial sector is one of the early adopters of AI and expects multiple benefits from its application, that is, the ability to provide better service in the shortest time possible and at a lower cost. AI in the financial sector is based on an understanding of the business needs of financial organizations, institutions and markets and the ability to connect with technological capabilities. They are powerful tools that completely transform this sector. The basic idea of this paper is to consider where the real value of AI in the financial sector is, i.e. what are the practical aspects and business implications of AI in the financial sector globally. It is common knowledge that evolving technologies have always had a strong impact on the sectors in which they are applied because they give them the opportunity to improve existing manufacturing processes, services, customer experiences, operate more efficiently, achieve cost savings, etc. The aim of this paper is to identify areas of application of AI in the financial sector, and to explore leading AI applications that are changing the financial ecosystem, transforming the financial sector and that have the potential to significantly improve many of its functions.

The safety and reliability of deep learning-driven systems are still a question under research. The safety of an autonomous guided vehicle is dependent on the proper selection of sensors and the transmission of reflex data. Several academics worked on sensor-based difficulties by developing a sensor correction system and fine-tuning algorithms to regulate the system’s efficiency and precision. In this paper, the introduction of vision sensor and its scene terrain classification using a deep learning algorithm is performed with proposed datasets during sensor failure conditions. The proposed classification technique is to identify the mobile robot obstacle and obstacle-free path for smart logistic vehicle application. To analyze the information from the acquired image datasets, the proposed classification algorithm employs segmentation techniques. The analysis of proposed dataset is validated with U-shaped convolutional network (U-Net) architecture and region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) architecture model. Based on the results, the selection of 1400 raw image datasets is trained and validated using semantic segmentation classifier models. For various terrain dataset clusters, the Mask R-CNN classifier model method has the highest model accuracy of 93%, that is, 23% higher than the U-Net classifier model algorithm, which has the lowest model accuracy nearly 70%.

To well assist the IWLS, advanced network architecture and control policies with the adaptive capability to the variation of traffic should be specially designed. In this paper, we consider an air-and-ground cooperative wireless network that enables dynamic coverage to support the flexible scheduling of the automatic guided vehicles (AGVs) in the IWLS. Jointly considering the dynamic deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as well as the adaptive power control of AGVs, we formulate a two time-scale network control problem to minimize the transmission power consumption of all AGVs under their individual rate requirement. On large time scales, we first propose a particle swarm optimization based algorithm (PSOA) to obtain the deployment position of the ABS. Then, using the results of the PSOA as training data, we design a deep neural network (DNN) framework aimed at reducing the computational time of the PSOA. On small time scales, we devise an online power control algorithm (OPCA) by using some of stochastic network optimization methods. With current channel conditions, the OPCA can generate the real-time power control policy and ensure the long-term rate requirement. Numerical simulations indicate that the DNN framework enhances the coverage performance of the network only consuming a few milliseconds of computation time. Incorporated with the OPCA, the total transmission power of the AGVs is significantly reduced.","The authors are grateful to King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for funding this work through Researchers Supporting Project number RSP-2021/18.",Future Generation Computer Systems,,,2022-12,2022,,2022-12,137,,164-172,Closed,Article,"Zhai, Daosen; Wang, Chen; Cao, Haotong; Garg, Sahil; Hassan, Mohammad Mehedi; AlQahtani, Salman A.","Zhai, Daosen (School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi’an, Shaanxi, 710072, China); Wang, Chen (School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi’an, Shaanxi, 710072, China); Cao, Haotong (Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China); Garg, Sahil (Resilient Machine Learning Institute (ReMI), Montréal, QC H3C 1K3, Canada); Hassan, Mohammad Mehedi (Information Systems Department, College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh 11543, Saudi Arabia); AlQahtani, Salman A.

It contributes to the in-depth development of the noosphere, the emergence of new industries and a qualitative transformation of production and distribution relations. The paper examines the impact of digitalization on transformational changes in the economy. As noted at the 14th G20 Summit, the main goals of digitalization are the development of innovations, focused on the development of society 5.0, ensuring the free flow of data and at the same time solving problems, related to information security and the protection of intellectual property rights, as well as bridging the digital gap and promoting the digitalization of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and the development of smart cities. The research methodology is based on theoretical and methodological analysis of the literature, statistical, comparative analysis, as well as synthesis, generalization and systems analysis. The study has revealed differences between the national approach and world experience in the interpretation of digitalization. For instance, in Ukraine the phenomenon involves, first of all, «digitization» in the field of data collection and analysis. At the same time, the concept of digitalization in developed countries is considered as the modernization of the manufacturing sector based on the implementation of information and communication technologies in order to reduce the capital and material intensity of products to increase competitiveness. In addition, the level of development of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) as one of the indicators of the information society has been analyzed. As a result, it was found, that about 80 % of all central banks in the world have been working on projects to issue their own digital currency. The basic requirements for national CBDC have been systematized. The practical significance, presented in the paper, lies in making recommendations for policy implementation of national economy digitalization. It is important, first of all, to «digitize» the real manufacturing sector, but not only create all sorts of «remote access services», clearly define the government position on cryptocurrencies and continue to implement the project of e-hryvnia (digital currency of National Bank of Ukraine) introduction.",,Technology audit and production reserves,,,2021-12-23,2021,2021-12-23,,6,4(62),,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hlazova, Anna","Hlazova, Anna (State Organization «Institute of the Economy and Forecasting of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine»)",,"Hlazova, Anna ()",0,0,,,http://journals.uran.ua/tarp/article/download/248124/246091,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144271585,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Green innovation has therefore become a research hotspot. With the acceleration of the digitalization process in equipment enterprises, intelligent manufacturing equipment enterprises located at the top of the industrial chain are in urgent need of green core technology innovation activities. In order to explore the internal mechanism of core green technology innovation, this research introduces reputation theory into the evolutionary game analysis process. By constructing an evolutionary game model between the government and intelligent manufacturing equipment enterprises, this research analyzes the dynamic factors that affect the selection and evolution of the main strategies of the players in the evaluation game. The results show that corporate reputation, core green technology innovation profit, government subsidies, government reputation, and the cost for the government to support core technology, among other factors, importantly affect the game between the government and the enterprises. At the same time, since both the government and the enterprises are affected by the initial state and the maximization of the interests of both sides of the game, it is difficult for them to spontaneously reach an ideal stable and balanced state through a virtuous circle. The greater the profits and the reputation premium the core green technology innovation brings to the enterprises, the more favorable it is for the enterprises to choose core green technology innovation; government subsidies within a certain range will also drive enterprises to choose core green technology innovation. When the value of enterprise core green technology innovation is low, the cost for the government to support core green technology innovation is lower, enterprises will lose more opportunities and decline in global competitiveness, and it will become more favorable for the government to evolve towards supporting core green technology innovation. On the contrary, the government will gradually transfer its tangible hand to the intangible hand of the market based on the consideration of subsidies, innovation costs, and reputation.

Therefore, the aim of this work is to propose the method of support in the choice of a fluorescent penetrant to be used in FPI research. In the results of the usage of the proposed procedure, it is demonstrated that it is possible to reduce the negative impacts on the environment by FPI processes (through sustainability), while including other criteria, i.e., financial, security, productive (Industry 4.0), and societal (Society 5.0) criteria. The essence of the proposed method is to integrate two methods of decision support. These were the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method and the cost–quality analysis (AKJ). Using the AHP method, the quality level of fluorescent penetrant (to the satisfaction of the customer)—which included the sustainability criteria—are calculated. These criteria include natural environment, reactivity, combustibility, level of sensitivity, and type of washing (emulsification). Then, with the help of the AKJ, the most favorable penetrant—in terms of quality and cost—is calculated and, thus, indicated. This choice must include the concept of sustainable development. Therefore, this method can be used to choose fluorescent penetrants in manufacturing and service enterprises which carry out FPI.",We wish to appreciate the reviewers for the valuable suggestions that helped to significantly improve the quality of our revised manuscript.,Sustainability,,,2020-07-21,2020,2020-07-21,,12,14,5854,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pacana, Andrzej; Siwiec, Dominika; Bednárová, Lucia","Pacana, Andrzej (Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Aeronautics, Rzeszow University of Technology, al.

After clarifying definitions and discussing key technologies, the chapter discusses six sources of pressure toward digital business transformation in Japan. These pressures include overseas partners, fintech, the drop in Japanese population, generational change, and the preference for food grown in Japan. The sixth of these is a sense of innovation deeply baked into the upcoming generation that will likely impact all areas of life and business in Japan. The new generation is impatient with conventional services and feels the need for transformation as available labor decreases and aging increases demands of individuals on society. There is an additional, even though temporary, source of pressure as well – the 2020 Olympics. The sectors that are most likely to feel the impact of new digital technologies are finance, retail, manufacturing, services, agriculture, and elder care.

While there is growing research interest in these areas, examining the role of human element in the new smart shipping context is largely neglected. Through a systematic literature review, this paper aims to explore the multi-dimensional impact of autonomous shipping technology resulting from the application of Industry 4.0 and future industrial revolutions on seafarers. The impacts include the changing role of seafarers on-board and the strategies required to engage seafarers in their transition from traditional shipping to autonomous and smart shipping. The paper concludes that Industry 4.0 is being challenged for its shortfall in recognition of the importance of human role and its intelligence in the expected current industrial revolution. As a result, there is a demand to look further and beyond Industry 4.0 by introducing the next generation of industrial revolution, namely Industry 5.0. This paper suggests that the impact of this revolution in the maritime industry can be defined by concepts such as Maritime 5.0, Shipping 5.0, Seafarer 5.0, Maritime Education and Training 5.0 (MET 5.0).",,The Asian Journal of Shipping and Logistics,,,2022-03,2022,,2022-03,38,1,10-18,All OA; Gold,Article,"Shahbakhsh, Mehrangiz; Emad, Gholam Reza; Cahoon, Stephen","Shahbakhsh, Mehrangiz (Australian Maritime College, University of Tasmania, Australia); Emad, Gholam Reza (Australian Maritime College, University of Tasmania, Australia); Cahoon, Stephen (Sense-T/Australian Maritime College, University of Tasmania, Australia)","Shahbakhsh, Mehrangiz (Australian Maritime College; University of Tasmania)","Shahbakhsh, Mehrangiz (Australian Maritime College; University of Tasmania); Emad, Gholam Reza (Australian Maritime College; University of Tasmania); Cahoon, Stephen (University of Tasmania)",3,3,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajsl.2021.11.004,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142908299,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3505 Human Resources and Industrial Relations","9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

As there is an increasing need for faster production and shortening of the learning curve for new emerging technologies, Virtual Reality (VR) interfaces for enterprise manufacturing DTs seem to be a good solution. Furthermore, with the emergence of Industry 5.0 (I5.0) paradigm, human operators will be increasingly integrated in the systems interfaces though advanced interactions, pervasive sensors, real time tracking and data acquisition. This scenario is especially relevant in collaborative automated systems where the introduction of immersive VR interfaces based on production cell DTs might provide a solution for the integration of the human factors in the modern industrial scenarios. This study presents experimental results of the comparison between users controlling a physical industrial robot system via a traditional teach pendant and a DT leveraging a VR user interface. The study group involves forty subjects including experts in robotics and VR as well as non-experts. An analysis of the data gathered in both the real and the virtual use case scenario is provided. The collected information includes time for performing a task with an industrial robot, stress level evaluation, physical and mental effort, and the human subjects’ perceptions of the physical and simulated robots. Additionally, operator gazes were tracked in the VR environment. In this study, VR interfaces in the DT representation are exploited to gather user centered metrics and validate efficiency and safety standards for modern collaborative industrial systems in I5.0. The goal is to evaluate how the operators perceive and respond to the virtual robot and user interface while interacting with them and detect if any degradation of user experience and task efficiency exists compared to the real robot interfaces. Results demonstrate that the use of DT VR interfaces is comparable to traditional tech pendants for the given task and might be a valuable substitute of physical interfaces. Despite improving the overall task performance and considering the higher stress levels detected while using the DT VR interface, further studies are necessary to provide a clearer validation of both interfaces and user impact assessment methods.",,Robotics,,,2022-10-18,2022,2022-10-18,,11,5,113,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kuts, Vladimir; Marvel, Jeremy A.; Aksu, Murat; Pizzagalli, Simone L.; Sarkans, Martinš; Bondarenko, Yevhen; Otto, Tauno","Kuts, Vladimir (); Marvel, Jeremy A.

A Digital Twin(DT) is defined as a dynamic intelligent digital replica/model of the physical system/process/service/people which enables just-in-time informed decision making and root-cause analysis using AI. DTs are implanted at different levels such as Equipment/Asset Level Twin, System Level Twin, System of Systems (SoS) Level Twin. This research introduces a novel framework which is based on a Smart Secure Digital Twin (S2DT) to bridge the development gap compared to other leading industries such as manufacturing and automotive. The proposed model relies on Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) to implement edge intelligence and solve the problems of transfer latency and data overload and consequently achieves low carbon footprint. Edge Intelligence (EI) reduces energy consumption and enhances security and perspective maintenance. The Blockchain Technology is used to solve the privacy, and cybersecurity problems [4].

A well-designed alarm system can reduce the workload of operators parallel with the support of the production, which is in line with the approach of Industry 5.0. Using Process Mining tools to explore the operator-related event scenarios requires a goal-oriented log file format that contains the start and the end of the alarms along with the triggered operator actions. The key contribution of the work is that a method is presented that transforms the historical event data of control systems into goal-oriented log files used as inputs of process mining algorithms. The applicability of the proposed process mining-based method is presented concerning the analysis of a hydrofluoric acid alkylation plant. The detailed application examples illustrate how the extracted process models can be interpreted and utilized. The results confirm that applying the tools of process mining in alarm management requires a goal-oriented log-file design.","This work has been implemented by the TKP2021-NVA-10 project with the support provided by the Ministry of Culture and Innovation of Hungary from the National Research, Development, and Innovation Fund, financed under the 2021 Thematic Excellence Programme funding scheme.",Complexity,,,2022-09-19,2022,,2022-09-19,2022,,1-13,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bántay, László; Dörgö, Gyula; Tandari, Ferenc; Abonyi, János","Bántay, László (ELKH-PE Complex Systems Monitoring Research Group, University of Pannonia, Veszprém H-8200, Hungary, uni-pannon.hu); Dörgö, Gyula (ELKH-PE Complex Systems Monitoring Research Group, University of Pannonia, Veszprém H-8200, Hungary, uni-pannon.hu); Tandari, Ferenc (MOL Danube Refinery, Százhalombatta H-2443, Hungary); Abonyi, János (ELKH-PE Complex Systems Monitoring Research Group, University of Pannonia, Veszprém H-8200, Hungary, uni-pannon.hu)","Abonyi, János (University of Pannonia)","Bántay, László (University of Pannonia); Dörgö, Gyula (University of Pannonia); Tandari, Ferenc (); Abonyi, János (University of Pannonia)",0,0,,,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2022/8670154.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151130908,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 49 Mathematical Sciences,

From physical construction site entity modeling (PCSE modeling) and digital twins virtual body modeling (DTVB modeling) to virtual and real interaction modeling (VRI modeling), the digital twins process is fully applied to the various stages of building construction. The performance of the method proposed is further verified through the analysis of specific data. It is found that the model proposed shows better performance on the same platform and node compared with other models, and it shows the best scalability in the iterative calculation test on the Flink platform through efficient memory management and incremental iteration mechanism. In addition, the model has a delay of less than 100 milliseconds: in the Sleep scenario, the system delay of the latest model is about 5 times that of on the Flink, and the system interruption probability will firstly decrease and then increase when the time division factor (TDF) is increased.

544,pub.1147070366,10.3390/app12083887,,,Design of Cognitive Assistance Systems in Manual Assembly Based on Quality Function Deployment,"Increasing volatility and product individualization are leading to higher complexity in manual assembly. At the same time, production and processes must become more flexible, and humans have to adapt to new products more often and even faster. Industry 5.0 will increasingly focus on human-centric approaches, on the collaboration of humans and machines intensively using cognitive assistance systems. The design of an innovative cognitive assistance system is a complex task due to the many technological opportunities and their interrelationships. In the framework of this research, a method was developed enabling the systematic design of cognitive assistance systems that integrates business and worker requirements aiming at improving productivity, quality, worker satisfaction and well-being. The research question was approached by design science research having, as the main output, a systematic and innovative method for the design of cognitive assistance systems based on quality function deployment (QFD), referred to as cognitive assistance system-QFD (CAS-QFD). The developed methodology is divided into six phases and includes the iterative design of a cognitive assistance system starting from the assembly process. The method considers the information needs of the workers, the definition of the appropriate assistance functions and the selection of the interaction technologies. The exemplarily industrial evaluation highlighted the relevance of CAS-QFD for systematically designing cognitive assistance systems based on holistic requirements, identified at the worker, workplace, production area and, finally, at the enterprise level.",,Applied Sciences,,,2022-04-12,2022,2022-04-12,,12,8,3887,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pokorni, Bastian; Popescu, Daniela; Constantinescu, Carmen","Pokorni, Bastian (); Popescu, Daniela (); Constantinescu, Carmen ()",,"Pokorni, Bastian (); Popescu, Daniela (); Constantinescu, Carmen ()",1,1,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/8/3887/pdf?version=1649765067,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147070366,40 Engineering; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education,

From the nineteenth to the twenty-first century, information was given on the social models and educational systems that coincided with the turning points of industrial developments. While factory organization as characterized by mass production and nation-state citizenship shaped the education system of industrial societies, digitization and its values have left their mark on educational systems in the information society. Advanced technological developments in areas such as nanotechnology, biotechnology, or the Internet of things have led to a techno-futuristic model of society being placed on the agenda. In this context, we pursue the questions of how new technologies are changing the education system and what kind of solutions they are offering to its problems for education in future societies.

For instance, with their ability to work more locally to data sources and to controllable actuators, cloud continuum-based solutions are considered very promising for dynamic manufacturing line control/reconfiguration and for sustainability optimizations (reduction of power and materials consumption). In these contexts, privacy, data sovereignty/control, latency, reliability, and scalability are crucial. This short paper, summarizing some key concepts from the associated keynote speech, aims at offering an overview of the concept of Digital Twins (DTs) for Industry5.0 [1] and at showing some primary and state-of-the-art solution guidelines that are emerging in the field. In particular, in our H2020 IoTwins project [2], we promote, design, implement, and evaluate Industry5.0 DTs that are both distributed because they are able to run over differentiated cloud continuum virtualized resources, also by changing their location dynamically, and hybrid because they combine data-driven machine learning models and simulations based on mathematical-physical modeling of the cyber-physical systems they represent.

514,pub.1137210815,10.3390/su13084389,,,Neuro-Competence Approach for Sustainable Engineering,"Manufacturing systems under Industry 4.0, and their transition towards Industry 5.0, take into account the Quintuple Helix innovation model, associated with the sustainable development goals (SDGs) set by the UN and Horizon 2030, in which companies focus on operational efficiency in terms of the use and minimisation of resources for the protection of the environment. In this respect, the implementation of the circular economy model, which requires engineers to acquire appropriate competencies, enabling companies to establish this model at the manufacturing level. Moreover, competence has always been a priority for both the professional and the company. In this sense, connectivism has been called a learning theory for the digital era; this is the reason why a review of the state-of-the-art developments of this paradigm focused on engineering has been carried out. In this sense, the potential of the digital transformation in instruction to formulate an engineering model based on neuro-competences is of great interest, taking the connectivist paradigm as a methodological axis. To this end, a first bibliometric analysis has been carried out to identify the drivers on which to base the design of the neuro-competencies of the instructional engineering environment and the trend towards curriculum development under dual training models. The bibliographical research carried out on the connectivist paradigm has served to identify the trends followed to date in education within the subject area of engineering. These trends have not fully taken into account the leading role of the human factor within the socio-technical cyber-physical systems of sustainable manufacturing (SCSSM). The focus was more on the technology than on the adaptation of the uniqueness of the human factor and the tasks entrusted to him, which entails an additional complexity that needs to be addressed in both academic and professional contexts. In light of the foregoing, an improvement to the acquisition and management of competencies has been proposed to the academic, professional and dual engineering contexts. It is based on the transversal inclusion of the concept of neuro-competence applied to the competence engineering (CE) model, transforming it into the neuro-competence engineering (NCE) model. The foregoing provides a better match between the characteristics of the human factor and the uniqueness of the tasks performed by the engineer, incorporating activity theory (AT), the law of variety required (LVR), the connectivist paradigm and neuroscience as a transversal driver of innovation through fractality. This proposal enables a ubiquitous and sustainable learning model throughout the entire academic and professional life cycle of the engineer, placing it sustainably at the heart of the instructional and professional cyber-physical socio-technical system, thus complying with the SDGs set by the UN and Horizon 2030.",,Sustainability,,,2021-04-15,2021,2021-04-15,,13,8,4389,All OA; Gold,Article,"de Miranda, Susana Suarez-Fernandez; Aguayo-González, Francisco; Ávila-Gutiérrez, María Jesús; Córdoba-Roldán, Antonio","de Miranda, Susana Suarez-Fernandez (); Aguayo-González, Francisco (); Ávila-Gutiérrez, María Jesús (); Córdoba-Roldán, Antonio ()","de Miranda, Susana Suarez-Fernandez ","de Miranda, Susana Suarez-Fernandez (); Aguayo-González, Francisco (); Ávila-Gutiérrez, María Jesús (); Córdoba-Roldán, Antonio ()",3,3,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/8/4389/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137210815,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,"4 Quality Education; 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

509,pub.1142629008,10.1515/9783110693225,,,"Soft Computing in Smart Manufacturing, Solutions toward Industry 5.0","This chapter highlights the convergence of soft computing techniques with contemporary manufacturing and machining processes. The chapter has been divided into two subsegments, with the first one comprehensively discussing the machining processes and the integration of automation techniques in these processes. The importance and utility of computerized numerical control and part programming are interlinked with automation hardware and robotics. The extension of machining in Integrated Manufacturing Systems (IMS) with coordinated functioning of robotics and numerical control is also emphasized. The correlation of precision and Computer Integrated (Flexible) Manufacturing (CIM) cites key advantages of automation and computerized control over the conventional non-mechanized machining techniques or manual material removal operations. In the second subsegment, soft computing as a systems engineering approach has been discussed interlinking its aptness for the machining operations. The current soft computing methods including fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks (ANN), and genetic algorithms (GA) for the predictive modeling of machining operations has been elaborated in this chapter citing their utilization and significance in controlling, monitoring, and modeling these tasks. A comparison of soft computing approach for machining has also been associated with the finite element modeling (FEM) methods to outweigh the benefits of automated control and modeling in each operation, and their suitability for the specific machining tasks. The generic discussion is presented to the readers for selecting the suitable automation and modeling approach to augment certain machining tasks in the segment on computational optimization of themachining processes. The key soft computing modules are highlighted in a concluding synopsis as a mechanism for driving future process modernizations from the perspective of Industry 5.0 leveraging customer-centric digitization, advanced modeling technologies, cognitive computing, big-data management, robots, and smart machines tethered together for eco-friendly machining. The interconnected nature of the Industry 4.0-driven operations, combined with the rapid pace of digital transformation, poses a unique challenge in terms of cybersecurity, impacting businesses and their continuity and, thus, in citizens’ daily lives. The SecureIoT project introduced an open standards-based framework for IoT (Internet of Things) security, which enables IoT solution developers, integrators, and deployers to integrate and deploy secure IoT services that span multiple IoT platforms and involve networks of smart objects with embedded intelligence and semi-autonomous behavior. In addition to the implementation of the technical requirements, however, these primarily serve to provide work assistance to the people deployed in production, starting with safe and optimized processes of operators and machine setters, involving different levels within the production chain. Here, SecureIoT supports humans in adhering to the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of intime, in-quality, and in-cost maxims amidst the diversity of industrial complexity. This is exemplified by automated Machine-2-Machine (M2M) show-offs being controlled at new levels of trustworthiness, which are usually only applied to human-2-human communication. With this type of control, humans can provide a higher level of trust to the agile resource-driven automated decision-making processes for manufacturing and product security decisions. This way, SecureIoT contributes to the principles of human-centric industry and toward a secure and resilient society. Intelligent mobile robots are foreseen as one of the possible solutions to efficiently performing transportation and manipulation tasks in intelligent manufacturing systems (IMS) of Industry 4.0. In the last few decades, deep learning models have been recognized as a promising technique to enable the intelligent behavior of mobile robots for performing such tasks. For the particular problems of object detection and classification, a class of deep learning models, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), is the most widely used. This chapter presents an application of Region-based CNN (R-CNN) for advanced object identification tasks by using transfer learning. The proposed learning approach is further used for the improvement of Image- Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) algorithm used to control an intelligent mobile robot. The proposed algorithms are implemented in the MATLAB software package, and both simulation and the experimental verification of the proposed concept are performed on intelligent mobile robot, DOMINO (Deep learning Omnidirectional Mobile robot with INtelligent cOntrol). Four different CNN models are trained for object detection and classification, and the most suitable CNN model is ResNet-18, with the best recorded mean Average Precision (mAP) of 77%. Achieved experimental results show the applicability of CNN for accurate detection and classification of different manufacturing entities and the IBVS algorithm for efficient mobile robot control within IMS. The digital twin is a digital replica of physical data, processes, systems, and a digital simulation of reality, which can be used for various purposes. The concept of the digital twin provides an efficient way to cyber-physically integrate production, and optimize business processes and operational production procedures, thus achieving a new higher level of productivity. Digital twins can use data from sensors installed on physical objects to represent their status in real time, operating condition, or position. Two examples of digital twin development are presented, the first is based on static setting of a model and the second is based on dynamic setting. One of the essential criteria for smart factories, specifically for open computer numerical control (CNC) machine tool, is to bridge the gap between the physical machine tool and upper-level software applications. The difficulties are due to lack of an efficient and sufficient monitoring system. The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) and information technology overcame those issues and enabled the implementation of the industry 4.0 concept. This chapter presents a methodology and a case study on a novel implementation of an open CNC PC (personal computer)-based and service-oriented architecture-based monitoring system for Standard for Exchange of Product compliant Numerical Control (STEP-NC). The service-oriented architecture was implemented to efficiently use and manage information. The architecture is composed of four main layers: perception, communication, application, and CNC machine layer. In the perception layer, the CNC machine tool’s information is sensed via wearable devices, including two temperature sensors (infrared and thermocouple), one vibration sensor, and one electric current sensor. Then, the information is output to Node-MCU (ESP 8266) as a wireless Wi-Fi module. Under the communication layer, message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) network protocol is used to enable data transfer from device to device. The information from Node- MCU is sent wirelessly to the MQTT server through a device called Raspberry-Pi. After that, the information from the MQTT server is sent to the Application layer, which includes Node-RED and ThingSpeak. Finally, the information from the application layer is sent to the CNC machine to enable feedback in real-time, based on the machining process condition information. The completed system is then tested through two cased studies for system feasibility. The first case study is based on STEP-NC EXAMPLE 1 of Part 21 consisting features of one hole and one pocket, while case study two is based on modified STEP-NC EXAMPLE 1 of Part 21 consisting features of four holes and two pockets. Through the case study, the developed system successfully enabled data flow from CNC machine tool to upperlevel software and back to the CNC machine through an open CNC PC-based and service-oriented architecture-based monitoring system for STEP-NC. In the future, this novel development could be applied to other open CNC machine-based plug and play. Industry 4.0 has increased the potential for intelligent, broad-based, fully adaptable, autonomous, and fully accessible vision system research and industrial inspections based on the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, with technical advancements and successes. One of the key objectives of using the 3SMVI system is to significantly improve the quality of the product in the smart industries. This system precisely bridges the gap between machine vision and object dimension measurements. This chapter proposes the development of subsystems of an automated smart system based on STEP-NC for machine vision inspection - 3SMVI to detect and measure the surface feature of EXAMPLE 1 Part 21 of the ISO14649 standards. The objective of this chapter is to examine the concept of 3SMVI in the milling machine based on the camera system and lighting system to ensure the quality of the product. It discusses the complete procedure for designing a 3SMVI system to inspect the dimensions of the case study of the Delrin workpiece in real time. The pending step is to accept the requirements and conditions for the inspection. Thus, some of these criteria relate to inspecting the case study and others imposed on the industry. The appropriate selection of each essential aspect of the 3SMVI system has been presented. The Open CV library- developed system platform becomes a kind of cloud communication between the Raspberry Pi 4 board and the USB microprocessor on the principle of camera range. The cameras, lenses, lighting system, and processing platform are the significant characteristics. Finally, this chapter describes the hardware part of the 3SMVI system. More precisely, the imaging systems design and installation configuration were very compact and complete in terms of integration into a single-camera setup mounted at the top of the spindle. The empirical results shown in this chapter demonstrate that the proposed innovative calibrating technique can produce a very accurate model of the structured light sensor system. Global development requires the use of contemporary soft computing in production processes. The introduction of intelligent production processes requires the consideration of more advanced aspects in modern production technologies. In response to market demands, it is necessary to introduce advanced cutting processes that are consistent with the concept of sustainable development, and supported by modern data processing and control technologies. In this chapter, the concept of smart machining in advanced cutting processes and their soft computing-based modeling are described. A machinability evaluation framework of based on the analysis and parameterization of the advanced machining process by the selection of influencing factors and process performance indicators is shown. This activity is referred to as the necessary phase that creates the background for soft computing. The fundamentals of various soft computing techniques used in data analysis, modeling, simulation, and optimization of advanced cutting processes are presented. Minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) and High-pressure jet assisted machining (HPJAM) were analyzed as advanced machining processes. Process analysis was performed using the bio-inspired algorithm soft computing, and conclusions were drawn about the machinability, efficiency, and economy of the machining process. Natural-fiber-reinforced polymer composites are utilized in various fields, such as military, construction, packing, and sports due to their remarkable characteristics. Machining of reinforced polymer composites by using conventional machining process is too difficult and not economical and, therefore, unconventional machining plays a vital role. This chapter presents the modeling and optimization of the Abrasive water jet machining (AWJM) process on the processing of bananafiber- reinforced polymer composites (BFRPC) by using the Taguchi - JAYA method. Firstly, BFRP composites are fabricated with 5% weight by using the hand layup process. Secondly, the experimental analysis is done based on Taguchi method (L27 orthogonal array) and JAYA optimization technique to analyze the impact of processing variables, such as working pressure (WP), stand of distance (SoD), and nozzle speed (NS) on two response variables: material removal rate (MRR) and surface roughness (SR). Thirdly, parametric analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and regression analysis are carried out for fitness and statistical implications of the AWJM process using BFRP composites. The investigation results showed that the AWJM process is the most efficient technique for machining BFRC composites. JAYA algorithm is applied to determine the optimal conditions of the AWJM process. Desirability function approach (DFA) is applied to determine the overall desirability value, considering both responses (MRR and SR) that could help to evaluate the optimal conditions. JAYA algorithm determined an exceptionally high desirability value, equal to 0.9952 (close to one), for the population size and maximum number of iterations set at 60 and 40, respectively. JAYA algorithm determined optimized conditions that resulted in the following percent deviations in prediction with respect to practical experimental results: 3.2% for MRR and 7.8% for SR.",,,,,2021-11-15,2021,2021-11-15,2021-11-22,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142629008,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

With the continuous emergence of new communication technologies and networking facilities, especially the rapid evolution of cellular networks for 5 G and beyond, the requirements for smarter, more reliable, and more efficient cellular network services have been raised from the Industry 5.0 blueprint. To meet these increasingly challenging requirements, proactive and effective allocation of cellular network resources becomes essential. As an integral part of the cellular network resource management system, cellular traffic prediction faces severe challenges with stringent requirements for accuracy and reliability. One of the most critical problems is how to improve the prediction performance by jointly exploring the spatial and temporal information within the cellular traffic data. A promising solution to this problem is provided by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which can jointly leverage the cellular traffic in the temporal domain and the physical or logical topology of cellular networks in the spatial domain to make accurate predictions. In this paper, we present the spatial-temporal analysis of a real-world cellular network traffic dataset and review the state-of-the-art researches in this field. Based on this, we further propose a time-series similarity-based graph attention network, TSGAN, for the spatial-temporal cellular traffic prediction. The simulation results show that our proposed TSGAN outperforms three classic prediction models based on GNNs or GRU on a real-world cellular network dataset in short-term, mid-term, and long-term prediction scenarios.",,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,,,2022-06-20,2022,2022-06-20,,PP,99,1-10,All OA; Green,Article,"Wang, Zi; Hu, Jia; Min, Geyong; Zhao, Zhiwei; Chang, Zheng; Wang, Zhe","Wang, Zi (School of Computer Science and TechnologyUniversity of Electronic Science and Technology of China); Hu, Jia (College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter, U.K.); Min, Geyong (College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter, U.K.); Zhao, Zhiwei (School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China); Chang, Zheng (School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China); Wang, Zhe (School of Computer Science and TechnologyUniversity of Electronic Science and Technology of China)",,"Wang, Zi (University of Electronic Science and Technology of China); Hu, Jia (University of Exeter); Min, Geyong (University of Exeter); Zhao, Zhiwei (University of Electronic Science and Technology of China); Chang, Zheng (University of Electronic Science and Technology of China); Wang, Zhe (University of Electronic Science and Technology of China)",1,1,,,https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/10871/130069/1/TII_FINAL_VERSION_exeter_upload.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148814200,40 Engineering; 4006 Communications Engineering,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The application of novel technologies such as pervasive sensing, widespread internet of the things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and robotics aims to sense, calculate, and actuate by employing data-driven architectures and automated decisions for reaching more efficient processes that reduce environmental impacts and transform manpower workloads. This work introduces a cyber-physical system (CPS) towards more innovative operations within the mining industry’s mine-to-mill process, whereby the operations’ decision-making and executions are often done by human intelligence. However, the increasing use of autonomous machines or mechatronics (MEC) such as trucks, drills, drones, and conveyor belts, combined with advanced modelling and solving algorithms (MSA), can achieve the necessary autonomous operations for handling such hazards and harsh environments, where no or reduced manpower is required. For that, information and computing technologies (ICT) facilitate innovative solutions to re-shape and re-design production systems. The interplaying of advanced technologies of the I4 mandate and circular economy (CE) ideology towards the mines of the future creates a smart connected mining industry that embeds vast amounts of data into predictive and fully integrated intelligent systems. This paper discusses how I4’s technological developments in mining sector applications generate opportunities to re-design and re-execute stockpiling to conveyor-belt processes into enhanced production states from a CE perspective (environmental, economic, and social).

This study used a total of 217 responses adopting the cross-sectional survey research design from manufacturing SMEs owners/founders. The results were analysed using PLS-SEM via SmartPLS version 3.3.3. The major findings established that entrepreneurial orientation did not directly link with the sustainable growth of SMEs. The study confirmed that market orientation and resource orientation revealed a direct and significant positive link with the sustainable growth of SMEs. Similarly, innovation competitive advantage has a direct significant positive association with the sustainable growth of SMEs. Likewise, entrepreneurial orientation and market orientation have a direct and significant positive relationship with innovation competitive advantage. However, resource orientation did not significantly relate to innovation competitive advantage. The findings validated that innovation competitive advantage mediated the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation, market orientation, and the sustainable growth of SMEs. Finally, innovation competitive advantage did not mediate between resource orientation and sustainable growth of SMEs, which have not previously been proven in empirical studies. This study was designed to address the existing gaps and provide reasons to prove them. This study is indeed one of the remarkable studies in the context of SMEs, which integrates these selected variables into a single model.

The key enabling technology that has made Industry 4.0 a concrete reality is without doubt collaborative robotics, which is also evolving as a fundamental pillar of the next revolution, the so-called Industry 5.0. The improvement of employees’ safety and well-being, together with the increase of profitability and productivity, are indeed the main goals of human-robot collaboration (HRC) in the industrial setting. The robotic controller design and the analysis of existing decision and control techniques are crucially needed to develop innovative models and state-of-the-art methodologies for a safe, ergonomic, and efficient HRC. To this aim, this paper presents an accurate review of the most recent and relevant contributions to the related literature, focusing on the control perspective. All the surveyed works are carefully selected and categorized by target (i.e., safety, ergonomics, and efficiency), and then by problem and type of control, in presence or absence of optimization. Finally, the discussion of the achieved results and the analysis of the emerging challenges in this research field are reported, highlighting the identified gaps and the promising future developments in the context of the digital evolution.

Today, it is no longer possible to consider it a homogeneous group of trainees with a significant age difference. Different methods and tools are available to acquire knowledge. Digital technology, changes in time management, and changes in the way information is processed require new methods in adult learning. The acquisition of knowledge is necessary to enable workers to contribute to the digitization of the operating characteristics of production equipment and machinery in the context of Industry 4.0 and, on the other hand, to enable the combination of robotic and human skills to be launched in the 21 st century through Industry 5.0. In our research, we examine the perspectives of adult education institutions, adult education professionals, and the people involved in adult education to ameliorate the use of digital technology in adult education as effectively as possible. We looked at the readiness and openness of institutions and trainers and the digital competencies and expectations of adult learning users of different generations.

Although the notion of DX has garnered much research interest from practitioners, scholarship on this topic is somehow lagging behind, possibly because of the lack of theoretical frameworks on DX. Recently, most Japanese firms have begun to use diverse digital technologies to sustain their competitive advantages. However, the return of investment on digital technologies has not been as high as expected for some firms. Furthermore, as the visions of Industry 5.0 describe sustainable, resilient, and human-centered future factories that will require smart and resilient capabilities both from next-generation manufacturing systems and human operators, it is necessary to design resilient human–machine collaborations within factories. To this end, this paper presents a research model between DX technologies and scientific problem-solving in terms of deduction, induction, and abduction inference structures as an approach to resilient human–machine collaborations. The purpose of this research is to analyze the difference in the utilization pattern of the digital technology of American, German, and Japanese firms based on three types of decision-making methods. Next, we apply this framework in a comparative case study of two Japanese firms and one German firm, where we find that there is a difference in DX technologies utilization among the Japanese and German firms. We assert that the utilization of IoT technology in the United States and Germany is pursuing IoT with the aim of autonomous control, whereas Japanese firms prioritize robot–human collaboration. Finally, we discuss how our findings contribute to the burgeoning field of resilient human–machine collaborations by showing the distinct roles of deduction, induction, and abduction inference structures.

This study investigates the assembly line balancing problem (ALBP), considering HRC. This problem, abbreviated ALBP-HRC, arises in advanced manufacturing systems, where humans and collaborative robots share the same workplace and can simultaneously perform tasks in parallel or in collaboration. Driven by the need to solve the more complex assembly line-balancing problems found in the automotive industry, this study aims to address the ALBP-HRC with the cycle time and the number of operators (humans and robots) as the primary and secondary objective, respectively. In addition to the traditional ALBP constraints, the human and robot characteristics, in terms of task times, allowing multiple humans and robots at stations, and their joint/collaborative tasks are formulated into a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. A neighborhood-search simulated annealing (SA) is proposed with customized solution representation and neighborhood search operators designed to fit into the problem characteristics. Furthermore, the proposed SA features an adaptive neighborhood selection mechanism that enables the SA to utilize its exploration history to dynamically choose appropriate neighborhood operators as the search evolves. The proposed MILP and SA are implemented on real cases taken from the automotive industry where stations are designed for HRC. The computational results over different problems show that the adaptive SA produces promising solutions compared to the MILP and other swarm intelligence algorithms, namely genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and artificial bee colony. The comparisons of human/robot versus HRC settings in the case study indicate significant improvement in the productivity of the assembly line when multiple humans and robots with collaborative tasks are permissible at stations.",,Computers & Operations Research,,,2022-04,2022,,2022-04,140,,105674,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Nourmohammadi, Amir; Fathi, Masood; Ng, Amos H.C.","Nourmohammadi, Amir (Division of Intelligent Production Systems, University of Skövde, P.O.

We speak now of Industry 5.0: industry 4.0 with the emphasis of ecology and human aspects. In this context the aim of this paper is to present the new issues for worker’s health and safety which have to be taken into account as soon as possible in the workplace design process and its use. We are speaking of “integrated prevention” which has to be applied from the system requirements to the functional design and the architectural design. Deployment of new technologies and organizations in the frame of FoF introduces hazardous events, problems of health and safety which have to be taken into account in the different life situations. The identification of dangerous situations therefore requires investigation of identification of characteristic design parameters related to risk qualification for the operator tasks. We start from the basic idea that accident is the interaction between a dangerous device and the worker, that can be directly linked to the generalized energy in a defined space. Each energy is characterized by parameters related to hazards for which the severity is defined by the standards and regulations.

Its drivers – advanced digital production technologies – are transforming the entire industrial and spatial landscape. Industrial regions take a special role in these transformations. The research aims to identify trends in the development of basic industries in industrial regions and work out a method to form their new technological image. Methodologically, the study relies on the institutional theory, theories of sustainable and longterm technical and economic development; applies methods of comparative, statistical, structural analysis and neural network modelling. Considering the case of the Ural metal industries, the study reveals the main trends of development and possibilities of forming the image of future of the basic industries of Russia’s industrial regions, as well as specifies the factors that modify these trends under the New Normal. Due to institutional and technological transformations, the Russian metal industries have achieved impregnable positions in the world market. The paper substantiates the changes in the development of the basic industries linked with the formation of Industry 5.0 as the new management paradigm, which assigns priority to the ESG factors. The research demonstrates that an indispensable condition for the successful functioning of companies is the ability to cooperate and agree on decisions. The findings confirm that modernised metal and other basic industries through integrating green, digital and behavioural economy will not only maintain, but are likely to increase their importance in the economy of industrial regions.",,Journal of New Economy,,,2022-07-08,2022,2022-07-08,2022-07-08,23,2,9-28,All OA; Gold,Article,"Romanova, Olga A.; Sirotin, Dmitry V.","Romanova, Olga A.

468,pub.1117021143,10.1109/icps.2019.8733363,,,Enhancing Reliability of Power Systems through IIoT - Survey and Proposal,"This article presents an idea of achieving reliability through Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for industrial power systems. It proposes hybrid approach for predictive and corrective maintenance. It discusses the self-corrective maintenance (SCM) paradigm as hybrid approach for industrial power systems along with condition-based maintenance approach utilizing IIoT to achieve it. As it is well known that industries pay huge penalty for the down time, and suffer to meet reliability demands for years. Study witnesses its cost in millions of dollars yearly for production disruptions. It can be prevented by proactively following the aggressive maintenance schedule. However, it often becomes expensive as part or service may not be utilized for its full life and failure may occur even in middle of maintenance cycle. On the other hand, condition-based maintenance (CBM) helps utilize the full life and prevents the downtime by predicting the failures ahead. This article reviews current maintenance practices followed by industry leaders and a proposal on self-corrective maintenance based on condition of restorable resources. It is about learning the condition of subsystems by itself and taking corrective action when subsystem is not active. This concept helps reduce manual intervention to correct the problem as well as the maintenance cost. This research also covers the self-uncorrectable issues to be handled by proactively following CBM process through IIoT. This hybrid proposal could be a significant gear shift in maintenance direction for general industry as well as power systems.

This evolution relies mainly on advanced digital technologies, including Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), by deploying multiple IIoT devices within industrial systems. Such a setup increases the possibility of threats, especially with the emergence of IIoT botnets. This can provide attackers with more sophisticated tools to conduct devastating IIoT attacks. Besides, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are considered as powerful techniques to efficiently detect IIoT attacks. However, the centralized way in building learning models and the lack of up-to-date datasets that contain the main attacks are still ongoing challenges. In this context, multiaccess edge computing (MEC) and federated learning (FL) are two promising complementary technologies. MEC brings computing capabilities at the edge of the industrial systems, while FL leverages the edge resources to enable a privacy-aware collaborative learning, especially in multiindustrial systems context. In this article, we design a novel MEC-based framework to secure IIoT applications leveraging FL, called FedGame. Specifically, FedGame enables multiple MEC domains to collaborate securely to deal with an IIoT attack, while preserving the privacy of IIoT devices. Moreover, a noncooperative game is formulated on the top of FedGame, to enable MEC nodes acquiring the needed virtual resources from the centralized MEC orchestrator, to deal with each type of IIoT attacks. We evaluate FedGame using real-world IIoT attacks; the experimental results show not only the accuracy of FedGame against centralized ML/DL schemes while preserving the privacy of Industrial systems but also its efficiency in providing required MECs resources and, thus, dealing with IIoT attacks.",,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,,,2022-04-26,2022,2022-04-26,,18,11,7988-7997,Closed,Article,"Houda, Zakaria Abou El; Brik, Bouziane; Ksentini, Adlen; Khoukhi, Lyes; Guizani, Mohsen","Houda, Zakaria Abou El (L@bISEN, ISEN Yncr, a Ouest, 44470, Carquefou, France); Brik, Bouziane (DRIVE EA1859, University Bourgogne Franche-Comt, 25000, Besan, on, France); Ksentini, Adlen (Department of Communication Systems, EURECOM, 06410, Biot, France); Khoukhi, Lyes (Nationale Sup, rieure d, ing, nieurs de Caen, Normandie University, GREYC CNRS, 14050, Caen, France); Guizani, Mohsen (Department of Machine Learning, Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, Masdar, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates)","Houda, Zakaria Abou El ","Houda, Zakaria Abou El (); Brik, Bouziane (); Ksentini, Adlen (EURECOM); Khoukhi, Lyes (Normandie Université); Guizani, Mohsen (Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence)",5,5,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147397736,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Hence, digital transformation becomes a pillar of industrial policy, known in Europe as “Industry 4.0,” in China as “made in China 2025,” in Asia as “Smart Cities,” in Japan as “Society 5.0,” and in North America as “Industrial Internet.” These transformations will change the industrial landscape, toward Quality 4.0 and therefore, our lives. The presented research was conducted on quality management employees in Portugal and it aims to analyze if such employees have the perception of the impact of Industry 4.0 in the quality management profession and the required and needed skills. After analyzing the answered questionnaires, 90 results were considered valid. This is the sample of our study. Simultaneously, the goal of this research is also to review and analyze the main topics in progress related to quality management for the fourth industrial revolution and how quality emerges of this change. The professionals that work on quality management must have creative thinking, be leaders, know how to communicate and work as a team, as well as, to have knowledge and understanding of ICT (Information and Communications Technology), and main pillars of Industry 4.0. These are the main findings. Besides that, they must know how to motivate their work teams, be open to change, know how to use Big Data to make decisions and above all, they must know how to manage conflicts. In addition, quality professionals must promote the design and production of first class products, be the defenders of their customers within the organization, and finally, they must create value for the stakeholders.",The authors would like to thank all the quality professionals who responded to the survey that allowed this survey.,Sustainability,,,2021-05-30,2021,2021-05-30,,13,11,6149,All OA; Gold,Article,"Santos, Gilberto; Sá, Jose Carlos; Félix, Maria João; Barreto, Luís; Carvalho, Filipe; Doiro, Manuel; Zgodavová, Kristína; Stefanović, Miladin","Santos, Gilberto (ESD–Design School–Polytechnic Institute Cavado Ave, 4750-299 Barcelos, Portugal;, mfelix@ipca.pt); Sá, Jose Carlos (Engineering School, Polytechnic of Porto, 4200-465 Porto, Portugal;, cvs@isep.ipp.pt); Félix, Maria João (ESD–Design School–Polytechnic Institute Cavado Ave, 4750-299 Barcelos, Portugal;, mfelix@ipca.pt); Barreto, Luís (Escola Superior de Ciências Empresariais–Instituto Politécnico de Viana do Castelo, 4930-600 Valença, Portugal;, lbarreto@esce.ipvc.pt, (L.B.);, filipecarvalho@esce.ipvc.pt, (F.C.)); Carvalho, Filipe (Escola Superior de Ciências Empresariais–Instituto Politécnico de Viana do Castelo, 4930-600 Valença, Portugal;, lbarreto@esce.ipvc.pt, (L.B.);, filipecarvalho@esce.ipvc.pt, (F.C.)); Doiro, Manuel (Industrial Engineering School/IEA, Vigo University, 36208 Vigo, Spain;, mdoiro@uvigo.es); Zgodavová, Kristína (Faculty of Materials, Metallurgy and Recycling, Technical University of Košice, 040 01 Košice, Slovakia;, kristina.zgodavova@gmail.com); Stefanović, Miladin (Center for Quality, Faculty of Engineering, University of Kragujevac, 34000 Kragujevac, Serbia;, miladin@kg.ac.rs)","Santos, Gilberto (Polytechnic Institute of Cávado and Ave)","Santos, Gilberto (Polytechnic Institute of Cávado and Ave); Sá, Jose Carlos (); Félix, Maria João (Polytechnic Institute of Cávado and Ave); Barreto, Luís (Polytechnic Institute of Viana do Castelo); Carvalho, Filipe (Polytechnic Institute of Viana do Castelo); Doiro, Manuel (Universidade de Vigo); Zgodavová, Kristína (Technical University of Košice); Stefanović, Miladin (University of Kragujevac)",25,25,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/11/6149/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138495867,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour","9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The actual problem of digitalization means, degree and consequences of influence on fostering public and personal opinion in society is considered in the article. The purpose of the study was to show that digitalization is qualitatively changing some aspects of social life. Methodology. Determination of digitalization means, degree and consequences of influence on some aspects of social life was carried out by analysis of work results of some sites/portals devoted to events of World War II. Results. Digitalization nowadays is a process being quickly spread all around the world. It covers a wide range of human activities: business, industry, agriculture, education, healthcare, culture and social life. The process being very new, complex and challenging demands developing of a high (state) level strategy such as “ Industrie 4.0” - one of ten projects for State Hi-Tech Strategy of Germany up 2020 or “Digital Economy of the Russian Federation”. Moreover it becomes obvious that digitalization influences not only “production” but also society. In 2016 Japan released concept “Society 5.0” - a large plan of social transformations. Interesting and remarkable results in fostering some aspects of social life were also reached in the Russian Federation during preparation of Great Victory 75th anniversary celebration. Conclusion. It is demonstrated that massive digitalization of personal archives (photos, documents, family/participant of events stories, eyewitness accounts) as well as access to archived data of state institutions and possibility to translate all information for free has fostered qualitatively new personal and social attitude to remarkable historical events.",,RUDN Journal of Informatization in Education,,,2020-12-15,2020,2020-12-15,,17,2,134-145,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lvova, Olga V.; Владимировна, Львова Ольга","Lvova, Olga V.

The KKN 49 group was located in Sabdodadi Village, Kapanewon Bantul, Bantul Regency, Sepecial Region of Yogyakarta. Sabdodadi village has several potentials, such as cultural potential, tourism potential, and natural resource potential (SDA). Based on the potential of existing natural resources, the KKN 49 group will make village potentials regarding ""Processing the Production of Banana Fruits in Sabdodadi Village into Banana Nuggets"". Utilization of this potential is expected to improve the village economy through the culinary industry. The group also found data where from 2019 to 2020 there was a decrease in the number of tourist attraction visitors so that their income also decreased. In addition, there was a decline in the production value of the clothing and leather industry. So to boost the economy of the clothing and leather industry, the KKN 49 group made a pocket book on ""How to Marketing Leather Crafts Online with Instagram Business and Whatsapp Business"". Abstrak— Melalui lembaga penelitian dan Pengabdian masyarakat (LPPM) Universitas Atma Jaya Yogyakarta mengusung program KKN Society 5.0 yang berfokus pada program pengabdian masyarakat melalui sarana daring tanpa adanya kontak seccara langsung dengan warga sekitar, dengan proses mekanisme keseluruhan secara daring, mulai dari pengambila, penentuan program, hingga pelaksanaan pembuatan program kerja. Kelompok KKN 49 mendapatkan lokasi di Desa Sabdodadi, Kapanewon Bantul, Kabupaten Bantul, Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta. Desa Sabdodadi memiliki beberapa potensi, seperti potensi budaya, potensi wisata, dan potensi sumber daya alam (SDA). Berdasarkan potensi sumber daya alam yang ada, kelompok KKN 49 akan membuat potensi desa tentang “Pengolahan Hasil Produksi Buah Pisang Desa Sabdodadi menjadi Nugget Pisang”. Pemanfaatan potensi ini diharapkan dapat meningkatkan perekonomian desa melalui industri kuliner. Kelompok juga menemukan data di mana pada tahun 2019 sampai tahun 2020 terjadi penurunan jumlah pengunjung objek wisata sehingga pendapatannya juga menurun. Selain itu, terjadi penurunan nilai produksi industri sandang dan kulit.

It is proved that with the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic the number of operating enterprises in Ukraine increased by 1,65%. At the same time, the number of unprofitable enterprises increased by 28,6%. Odesa oblast, Kirovohrad oblast and Kyiv are the regions most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine. It is determined that the loss of profits from the COVID-19 pandemic in large enterprises is 10-25%, and in small enterprises 25-50%. It is proved that the declining trend of profitability of operating activities of domestic enterprises accelerated further in the COVID-19 pandemic and reached 3,9% in 2020. Quarantine restrictions imposed in Ukraine led to the suspension of domestic enterprises, which faced additional problems. Among such problems are: the need to restructure the current business model of enterprises, reduce staff, increase production costs, reduce sales and other problems. It was found that smart companies did not face the problems of business organization and profitability under quarantine restrictions. Such enterprises timely fully ""digitized"" business processes based on modern information and communication technologies and other technologies of Industry 5.0; have high innovation activity; in the structure of the enterprise created its own research laboratory for the implementation of innovative developments; are energy and cost saving; constantly reduce the time of launch of a new product on the market, improve product quality. Examples of efficient and profitable domestic smart enterprises in various industries are given. For example, smart enterprises in the field of insurance increased the number of contracts concluded in Ukraine for compulsory civil liability insurance of vehicle owners in electronic form by 3,2 times compared to 2019; Retail enterprises increased the share of sales via the Internet by 2,1%, non-cash payments increased by 36% of the total retail trade in Ukraine.",,Black Sea Economic Studies,,,2022,2022,2022,2022,,73,,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Shatska, Zorina; Silivonchyk, Olena","Shatska, Zorina (); Silivonchyk, Olena ()",,"Shatska, Zorina (); Silivonchyk, Olena ()",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.32843/bses.73-7,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147875587,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4801 Commercial Law,

The Department of Health (DH, now DHSC) asked the Health & Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC, now NHS Digital), a non-departmental public body, to co-produce a new social care data framework that better measures the results. This was an unprecedented new data production project, the Zero-Based Review (ZBR).The ZBR project is divided into five areas: (a) Safe Guarding Stakeholder Group, (b) EQ-CL Stakeholder Group, (c) SALT (Short and Long Term support) Stakeholder Group, (d) ASC-FR (Adult Social Care Finance Return) Stakeholder group, (e) Communications group.Traditional data shows the support system and status, such as the number of service users and the number of supports provided, but the SALT data shows the state after the care assessment. New items such as leading to independence, leading to long-term support, transition to end-of-life care, refusal of support, etc. have been added. The ZBR project emphasized “outcomes” rather than traditional service “structures” or “processes” so that the data collected can improve the practice of delivering social care support. Some of the data is reflected in the Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework (ASCOF), an important indicator set of local government achievements in social care policies and practices. The ZBR project started in 2011, and the data was constructed over several years. The data items are still being revised as appropriate in response to the revision of the law and social care policy.We believe that examining this new construction effort for social care data in England will also be helpful for Japan, which is currently working on the realization of a “data-driven society” in society 5.0.",,保健医療科学,,,2021-10,2021,,,70,4,438-446,Closed,Article,"ジョナサン, キルワース; 秀人, 高橋; 久美子, 小田 キルワース; 真由美, 林; 菜奈子, 田宮","ジョナサン, キルワース (区役所戦略的業務委託部); 秀人, 高橋 (国立保健医療科学院); 久美子, 小田 キルワース (元ジャパングリーンメディカルセンター健康診断部・看護部); 真由美, 林 (大学エディンバラ認知症の経験研究センター); 菜奈子, 田宮 (筑波大学ヘルスサービスリサーチ分野ヘルスサービス開発研究センター)",,"ジョナサン, キルワース (); 秀人, 高橋 (National Institute of Public Health); 久美子, 小田 キルワース (); 真由美, 林 (); 菜奈子, 田宮 ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145015201,44 Human Society; 4409 Social Work,

The conference provides a forum for discussion on improving the quality of research and publication by promoting cutting-edge methods of Statistics, Mathematics, Science, and Teaching. The conference program includes a keynote presentation, workshops, invited speakers, and parallel presentation sessions. Due to the Covid-19 outbreak, this conference has been successfully held virtual and non-virtual (for presenters or participants from Makassar with health protocol of Covid-19) on 9-10 October 2021 at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, UNM, Makassar Indonesia. The theme of this conference is “Optimizing Data Science to Reach Society 5.0 through High-Quality Research” with aims to increase collaboration between researchers from various universities and countries in the fields of Statistics, Mathematics, Science, and Teaching as well as to increase the number of researcher publications in journals or proceedings indexed by indexers with international reputations such as SCOPUS and Web of Science. We have 8 invited speakers and 84 presenters both from local and international presenters. The international presenters come from 10 countries namely Nigeria, Thailand, China, Taiwan, Australia, French, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The local presenters come from about 46 institutions/universities.

Moreover, advances in the Digital Era may also foster citizenship development as shown in the next paper; but at the same time represent a challenge regarding professional skills needed in particular for startups that are growing rapidly in number and size everywhere; so this is context of the next paper. Next paper is a study on the Quality of Life at work based on Leadership Models that in particular shows the positive impacts of a more Participatory Leadership. Next paper shows, through a survey of 396 companies in Brazil, that only a small number of organizations deal with the process of retaining professionals identified as potential successors that no doubt could be very relevant for the organization. Regarding Human Resources next paper is a study based on a Semantic Analysis about possibilities that are opening already, at the recruitment and selection process, by using Artificial Intelligence. Next paper seeks to find relationships between motivation and engagement and project management by means of a bibliometric analysis. For this purpose, was performed a cluster analysis of 529 articles using VOXviewer indicated that motivation in projects is strongly linked to professional development and growth, with increased interest in sustainability and in the relationship with stakeholders represented by the internal and external community of projects; and regarding Organizational Culture next paper shows, through a survey of 109 Organizations in Brazil, the importance of integrating Cultural Diversity in Organizations that may not only help to improve social conditions but also lead to recruiting better talents and leads to greater customer orientation, greater employee satisfaction and better decision making representing a win-win strategy. Still regarding Organizational Culture, and based on Quinn and Rohrbaugh’s model, next paper focus impacts on Competitive Strategy in the Banking Segment following Quinn and McGrath approach. Next paper is a statistical study regarding Fidelity in the Physical Fitness Business, using Logistic Regression and unidirectional ANOVA, that surprisingly show that frequency of use was the most relevant variable related to customer retention, rather than price and membership length. Today’s economic impacts of COVID-!9 is leading Public Policies in Governments like Brazil to drastically reduce Investments in Science and Technology that may end up decreasing the Human Development Index – HDI, as shown by next paper based on a previous study of the performance indicators in Science, Technology and Innovation CT&I in 14 countries including some like Brazil. Today, 55% of the world's population lives in urban areas, a proportion that is expected to increase to 68% by 2050; as a matter of fact by 2050, two-thirds of all humanity will live in urban areas; and higher changes have actually been in Latin America and the Caribbean with 81.2% of the population already living in urban areas, up from 41.3% in 1950. Hence particularly in these regions sustainable development will become fundamental for the management of cities, so next paper dealing with a small city in southern Brazil may be helping as Best Practice Case. The city was able, through Team Works, to developed a Municipal Goals Plan based on the Sustainable Development Goals - SDG and in less than 4 years (2017-2020) 90% of which were reached through Work Teams driven basically by: The engagement of those responsible for2RISUS – Journal on Innovation and Sustainability, São Paulo, v. 12, n.2, p. 1-3, abr./mai. 2021 - ISSN 2179-3565Administrative Management, The importance of planning, at both strategic and operational levels, and the commitment of the teams in the execution of the actions. Actually, Brazil for some time has being already counting with an Open Sustainable Cities Program that help cities to develop its own strategies accordingly. Next paper is a survey of 48 companies in Brazil that using Crunchbase and Iramuteq technologies found three classes of business blockchain impact on Business models: A distributed value structure, a governance structure and an application structure aimed at encrypted and tokens. Next paper coming from Ukraine shows an approach for modelling a System of Balanced Criteria of Business Process Management (BPM), focused on large data volumes with a basic processes implemented using the cloud computing service — math.semestr, that may be promising in terms of automation of business process management. Last paper comes from Malaysia and deals with a trial on Home Buyers´ Willingness to Pay (WTP), using an on-line survey constructed using the LMA design tool provided in the ‘support.CEs’ package that showed that even a small and diversified sample of 20 respondents dealing with home buyer preferences for sustainable housing and analyzed using the package’s clogit function may give some results even for the measurement of a higher number of variables.",,Journal on Innovation and Sustainability,,,2021-06-18,2021,2021-06-18,,12,2,1-3,All OA; Gold,Article,"de Hoyos Guevara, Arnoldo José","de Hoyos Guevara, Arnoldo José (Pontifícia Universidade Católica de São Paulo, São Paulo, São Paulo)",,"de Hoyos Guevara, Arnoldo José (Pontifícia Universidade Católica de São Paulo)",0,0,,,https://revistas.pucsp.br/index.php/risus/article/download/54292/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149169957,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",
