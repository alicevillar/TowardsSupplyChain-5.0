000-233-079-650-433,Employing multimodal co-learning to evaluate the robustness of sensor fusion for industry 5.0 tasks,2022-03-07,2022,journal article,Soft Computing,14327643; 14337479,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Germany,Anil Rahate; Shruti Mandaokar; Pulkit Chandel; Rahee Walambe; Sheela Ramanna; Ketan Kotecha,"Industry 5.0 focuses on collaboration between humans and machines, demanding robustness and efficiency and the accuracy of intelligent and innovative components used. The use of sensors and the fusion of data obtained from various sensors/modes increased with the rise of the internet of things. The multimodal sensor fusion provides better accuracies than a single source/mode system. Typically, in multimodal fusion, data from all sources is assumed to be available all the time, aligned, and noiseless. Contrary to this highly unrealistic assumption, data from one or more sources is generally unavailable or noisy in most real-world applications. Hence, there is a need for robust sensor fusion, which is a more realistic scenario and critical for Industry 5.0 implementations. Multimodal co-learning is one such approach to study the robustness of sensor fusion for missing and noisy modalities. In this work, to demonstrate the effectiveness of multimodal co-learning for robustness study, gas detection systems are considered a case study. Such gas detection systems are prevalent and crucial to avoid accidents due to gas leaks in many industries and form a part of the industry 5.0 setup. This work considers the primary dataset of gas sensors data and thermal images for robustness experimentation. The results demonstrate that multi-task fusion is robust to missing and noisy modalities than intermediate fusion. Having an additional low-resolution thermal modality supports co-learning and makes it robust to 20% missing sensor data, 90% missing thermal image data, and Gaussian and Normal noise. The end-to-end system architecture proposed can be easily extended to other multimodal applications in Industry 5.0. This study is a step towards creating standard practices for a multimodal co-learning charter for various industrial applications.",,,,,Robustness (evolution); Sensor fusion; Computer science; Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Data mining; Fusion; Soft sensor; Image fusion; Missing data; Real-time computing,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00500-022-06802-9,,10.1007/s00500-022-06802-9,,,0,000-857-321-508-079; 001-158-438-350-221; 005-838-156-198-65X; 006-360-333-337-70X; 014-895-985-074-838; 017-880-552-274-954; 018-797-290-467-391; 019-984-401-850-976; 020-507-342-645-238; 022-005-012-641-325; 022-713-144-061-442; 025-226-826-337-996; 029-881-975-308-001; 030-737-086-163-796; 030-814-327-209-342; 031-471-510-801-314; 034-159-377-591-84X; 035-079-078-102-854; 038-484-559-584-530; 038-899-579-075-770; 039-630-891-125-888; 040-562-225-943-41X; 041-369-817-756-257; 041-590-027-919-835; 044-477-985-619-160; 045-277-706-503-844; 050-585-593-199-684; 052-398-860-532-234; 052-975-240-408-918; 056-242-804-007-157; 056-319-636-633-679; 060-605-029-396-589; 063-233-674-987-060; 065-419-181-747-26X; 065-502-473-967-771; 067-075-282-112-462; 068-191-727-429-150; 069-505-632-986-355; 071-768-982-426-813; 072-605-432-124-458; 073-430-356-024-360; 075-845-201-364-683; 081-723-944-638-077; 099-040-978-927-388; 103-945-502-424-768; 108-931-235-672-242; 113-304-341-467-769; 113-597-278-076-379; 119-903-457-191-015; 121-615-053-749-84X; 125-514-312-709-432; 131-265-910-677-066; 137-545-498-757-199; 140-109-678-513-738; 151-319-008-270-751; 171-660-028-440-361,1,false,,

Ларюхин; П. О. Скобелев,"The paper proposes conceptual model of a digital platform for cyber-physical management of modern enterprises in the upcoming era of Industry 5.0. Unlike Industry 4.0, which focuses on automation of physical processes, Industry 5.0 is oriented on digitization of knowledge and automation of reasoning processes for creating artificial intelligence that is able to manage enterprises. This still emerging era will be characterized by the vision of any business, including industrial production or logistics, as a complex adaptive system built on fundamental principles of self-organization and evolution, as well as interaction of artificial intelligence systems and humans. The paper shows that implementation of such production and logistics management systems will require development of new models and decision-making methods based on knowledge and semantic information processing, integration of computational and communication components, accumulation of big data and its processing for predictive analytics, blockchain technologies for fixing mutual obligations of systems components in the for m of smar t contracts, as well as human-machine and software inter faces. Existing approaches to creation of digital platforms within the digital economy of Industry 4.0 and their limitations are analyzed. The concept of digital ecosystem is developed as an open, distributed, self-organized ""system of systems"" of smart services capable of coming up with solutions and automatically resolving conflicts through negotiations and concessions. The concept of the digital platform within Industry 5.0 is described, which will be able to support functioning of the digital ecosystem of ""smart services"" of cyberphysical management of both individual objects and enterprises of humans and robots, and in the future, industries of such enterprises — implemented using self-organizing autonomous agents at all levels.",20,6,323,332,Engineering management; Automation; Conceptual model; Digital economy; Digital ecosystem; Digitization; Computer science; Complex adaptive system; Big data; System of systems,,,,,https://mech.novtex.ru/jour/article/view/643,http://dx.doi.org/10.17587/mau.20.323-332,,10.17587/mau.20.323-332,2955334221,,0,005-980-029-960-100; 031-113-185-422-010; 084-660-337-279-766; 103-939-241-575-371; 191-481-912-103-632,6,false,,

M. Protalinsky; A. U. Shvedov; Anna A. Khanova,"The issue of equipment lifecycle management is considered—implementation of the program of maintenance and repair, capital replacement of equipment. During the life cycle of electrical grid equipment, it is possible to identify a period in which the total cost of repairing the equipment in the future will exceed its capital replacement with new equipment with similar indicators. The materials of domestic and foreign authors were studied on the topic of the operation of the power grid equipment park, regulatory and reference information for distribution power grid companies. Calculated functions are derived based on the economic indicators of the equipment - the cost of repairs, the book value, the level of inflation, taking into account the operation of the equipment. According to the task, a decision-making agent was developed for managing the life cycle of equipment of power grid companies based on economic indicators. The implementation of this algorithm in the production asset management system of interregional distribution grid companies will optimize the life cycle costs of a piece of equipment. The calculations made based on the decision-making algorithm in managing the life cycle of the equipment of power grid companies based on economic indicators indicate a decrease in the total cost of equipment by up to 10%. Investing the freed-up capital will allow the existing high-quality characteristics of the power grid equipment fleet.KeywordsStatus indexGrid equipmentMaintenanceRepairReplacement functionLife cycle",,,177,187,Grid; Capital equipment; Engineering; Capital cost; Control (management); Asset (computer security); Reliability engineering; Product life-cycle management; Operations management,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-95112-2_15,,10.1007/978-3-030-95112-2_15,,,0,001-787-961-183-044; 004-758-793-938-386; 006-777-001-978-416; 012-008-900-078-543; 018-115-954-828-700; 023-259-571-977-42X; 028-232-122-518-537; 033-541-372-628-755; 035-698-629-532-299; 046-048-155-408-791; 049-095-829-626-316; 076-134-267-838-218; 080-121-200-998-016; 094-440-788-411-867; 102-824-531-484-519,0,false,,

Skobelev,"The paper proposes conceptual model of a digital platform for cyber-physical management of manufacturing enterprises in the upcoming era of Industry 5.0, characterized by the vision of any business, including industrial production or logistics, as a complex adaptive system built on fundamental principles of self-organization and evolution, as well as interaction of artificial intelligence systems and people. The first part discusses principles of building a digital platform that can support operation of an enterprise within Industry 5.0 as a digital ecosystem of smart services. This part of the paper proposes typing of vasic platform services, lists the minimum set of services of each type, and gives description of their functionality.

Under this paper I have highlighted the pros and cons in favour and those oppose to the practice. The practitioners argued for its continuation because it was an important cultural heritage that marks the transition of a girl from childhood to adulthood while the abolitionists wanted it to be abolished because it violates human rights. I have adopted a doctrinal method of research under this paper to look into the veracity of the arguments of both sides. The prevailing opinion is that FGM or female circumcision violated both constitutionally guaranteed rights like rights to life, health, physical integrity, dignity, etc and human rights treaties and Conventions like United Nations Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Covenant on Civil and Political rights, the Maputo Protocol, etc. in view of this the practice should be abolished.      Keywords: Female, Genital, Mutilation, Circumcision, Cutting, Women’s Right.

Welfare; Matthew R. Hallowell; Julie A. Shah; Laurel D. Riek,"Worldwide, manufacturers are reimagining the future of their workforce and its connection to technology. Rather than replacing humans, Industry 5.0 explores how humans and robots can best complement one another's unique strengths. However, realizing this vision requires an in-depth understanding of how workers view the positive and negative attributes of their jobs, and the place of robots within it. In this paper, we explore the relationship between work attributes and automation goals by engaging in field research at a manufacturing plant. We conducted 50 face-to-face interviews with assembly-line workers $(\mathrm{n}=50)$ , which we analyzed using discourse analysis and social constructivist methods. We found that the work attributes deemed most positive by participants include social interaction, movement and exercise, (human) autonomy, problem solving, task variety, and building with their hands. The main negative work attributes included health and safety issues, feeling rushed, and repetitive work. We identified several ways robots could help reduce negative work attributes and enhance positive ones, such as reducing work interruptions and cultivating physical and psychological well-being. Based on our findings, we created a set of integration considerations for organizations planning to deploy robotics technology, and discuss how the manufacturing and HRI communities can explore these ideas in the future.",,,75,84,Field research; Variety (cybernetics); Psychology; Task analysis; Work (electrical); Workforce; Work experience; Knowledge management; Autonomy; Discourse analysis,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/hri/hri2019.html#WelfareHSR19 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8673139/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/hri.2019.8673139,,10.1109/hri.2019.8673139,2929884532,,0,001-121-290-926-132; 002-584-751-652-291; 003-793-700-759-176; 004-354-297-930-966; 004-771-471-010-549; 012-370-295-968-16X; 012-710-005-889-438; 013-420-504-189-875; 014-398-665-908-576; 016-782-552-400-986; 017-089-665-436-038; 018-601-301-453-597; 022-425-262-957-817; 024-649-196-865-724; 029-101-543-228-171; 032-254-293-408-115; 036-704-073-047-822; 041-526-359-881-654; 042-211-564-277-43X; 042-534-131-021-574; 042-588-618-550-033; 046-013-428-757-779; 046-875-312-520-293; 048-522-436-982-27X; 055-472-948-144-561; 056-728-662-820-803; 059-474-784-814-112; 065-623-633-767-666; 067-038-345-648-879; 068-013-611-636-252; 070-801-412-682-60X; 071-095-229-290-158; 073-128-134-887-817; 079-223-098-124-911; 084-969-912-500-793; 086-419-127-879-925; 088-721-426-301-445; 090-334-590-886-301; 091-725-872-061-572; 091-954-013-787-526; 095-811-393-275-086; 098-346-104-521-26X; 098-620-854-119-009; 101-113-684-704-95X; 103-597-914-038-179; 104-096-765-444-763; 111-141-823-258-031; 115-210-856-810-410; 120-441-241-892-092; 124-114-062-999-318; 134-932-989-205-250; 137-441-705-929-277; 138-223-939-384-207; 140-006-634-478-430; 142-048-600-326-867; 150-246-476-000-161; 161-172-850-367-669; 168-959-595-262-053; 171-596-748-965-859; 178-184-306-028-968; 178-912-373-262-853; 179-120-475-949-307; 193-364-789-473-151; 198-305-974-153-055,26,true,cc-by-nc-sa,green

The opportunities can contribute to the sustainable performance of the supply chains and their territories. The Industry 4.0 can also generate challenges like the social inequalities related to the position of the man in the labor market by replacing the human workforce with the machines. Therefore, the man-machine relationship in the Industry 4.0 era is analyzed as a gap in the literature. Therefore, as a way to fill this gap, the authors of this article suggest the exploration of the research focused on the Society 5.0. Also known as “super-smart society,” this recent theme appeared in Japan in April 2016. According to Fukuda (2020), in addition to the focus on the technological development, the Society 5.0 also aims at the quality of life and the social challenge resolutions.,This article contributes to the analysis of the Industry 4.0 technologies as facilitators in the sustainable supply chain performance. It addresses the impacts of the Industry 4.0 technologies applied to the supply chains in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it analyzes the research gaps and limitations found in the literature. The result of this study can add value and stimulate new research studies related to the application of the Industry 4.0 technologies as facilitators in the supply chain sustainable performance. It can encourage the studies related to the COVID-19 impacts on the sustainable supply chains, and it can promote the research development on the relationship among the man, the machine and the labor in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.",70,5,988,1016,Supply chain;

The formulation of the problem is the relationship between spiritual formation and God's Word in reformation. The author uses literature studies to collect information about spiritual formation and God's Word in reformation. Spirit for sola scriptura has produced a change in the life of the church at that moment. All teachings, church traditions, and practical actions which is conducted by church member must be tested under the Word of God. In the present context, the church who facing various challenges related to a moral life, teaching, and practical actions must return to the principles of the word of God. To build a spiritual life, we must start from the Bible that is interpreted correctly, which then becomes a theological development, which then influences the concept of believer's thinking and practical actions. Abstrak Artikel ini membahas tentang formasi rohani dan Firman Tuhan dalam reformasi. Rumusan masalah penelitian ini adalah bagaimana kaitan antara formasi rohani dan firman Tuhan dalam reformasi? Penulis menggunakan studi pustaka untuk menggali informasi tentang formasi rohani dan Firman Tuhan dalam reformasi. Semangat untuk sola scriptura menghasilkan perubahan dalam kehidupan gereja pada masa itu. Segala pengajaran, tradisi gereja, dan tindakan praktis yang dilakukan oleh setiap anggota gereja harus diuji di bawah Firman Tuhan. Dalam konteks masa kini, menghadapi berbagai tantangan gereja baik yang terkait dengan kehidupan moral maupun pengajaran dan tindakan praktis, gereja harus kembali pada prinsip Firman Tuhan. Untuk membangun kehidupan rohani maka harus dimulai dari Alkitab yang ditafsirkan secara benar yang kemudian menjadi sebuah bangunan teologi yang kemudian mempengaruhi konsep berpikir orang percaya dan tindakan praktis.",3,2,81,93,,,,,,http://jurnal.stttorsina.ac.id/index.php/epigraphe/article/view/85 http://www.stttorsina.ac.id/jurnal/index.php/epigraphe/article/view/85 http://www.stttorsina.ac.id/jurnal/index.php/epigraphe/article/download/85/38 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/270223215.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.33991/epigraphe.v3i2.85,,10.33991/epigraphe.v3i2.85,2995928599,,0,,13,true,,gold

However, no attempt has been made in the past decades to explore the emerging themes in this area. This paper reviews the research trends in risk management in construction. The bibliometric data of 1635 publications between 1979 and 2022 were extracted from Scopus using a set of keywords. The study used VOSviewer and Gephi to conduct a scientometric analysis on the extracted publications. The review outcome indicates a significant increase in publications on risk management in construction, with about 205 publications recorded between 2021 and 2022 alone. Based on this analysis, it is projected that the next decade will see significant research on risk management, especially as the construction industry moves towards Industry 5.0 with many uncertainties. Further, the most productive countries of risk management studies in construction include China, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Hong Kong. Emerging key research areas are discussed using network diagrams and clusters. These areas include the processes in risk management, risk analytical models and techniques, sources of risk and uncertainties, effective knowledge-based systems for improved risk management, risk contingency in construction contracts, risk-integrated project planning and scheduling, and stakeholder management.

N. Firdauzi; A. Arumsari,"Nowadays, with the increasing world population, the production and consumption of disposable products is very high. Thus, causing waste that fills the land and sea. Not only waste from humans, but the Indonesian sea also produces marine biota waste that is usually stranded on the coasts. Waste of marine life on Santolo Beach, Garut, produces a negative impact on public health and causes environmental disturbance if left around the beach as only a part of it is decomposed in the soil and the rest remains as waste. The purpose of this paper is to design jewelry that also has a traceable supply chain, and can also contribute to the welfare of the environment and local community of Sagaranten, Sukabumi. This can be interpreted as halal jewellery. The author interprets and reinterprets the ethical halal to be applied to jewelry to be Halal in the context of Sustainable Product Design (SPD). This SPD will demonstrate the meaning of halal jewelry by processing, environmentally friendly materials as well as various other considerations in the social and economic fields to achieve sustainable profit-making products.",,,17,21,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9781003263135-3,,10.1201/9781003263135-3,,,0,,0,false,,

In this chapter, the applications of supercritical fluid technology and algal biomass technology are highlighted. Supercritical fluid technology is a carbon-neutral technology that is highly unique and versatile which supports the notions of biomanufacturing in the bioeconomy concept. Besides replacing conventional extraction methods, supercritical fluids can be applied towards enzymatic pretreatment and activation, biological membrane synthesis and bioalcohol recovery due to its non-reactive, non-flammable and clean separation properties. On the other hand, the potential of algal biomass technology in bioenergy production such as bio-lipids and biohydrogen can be exploited due to the intrinsic properties of microalgae that acts as a backbone in the bioremediation of gaseous greenhouse gases. Furthermore, microalgae technology can be integrated into existing traditional refineries to act similar to a separator that captures unwanted emissions and converts them into value-added products.",,,257,286,Biohydrogen; Supercritical fluid; Bioenergy; Biochemical engineering; Oil refinery; Biomanufacturing; Biomass; Extraction methods; Environmental science; Greenhouse gas,,,,,https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781003080671-12-12/state-art-technologies-industry-5-0-yee-ho-chai-guo-yong-yew-suzana-yusup-pau-loke-show,http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9781003080671-12-12,,10.1201/9781003080671-12-12,3160869637,,0,087-682-287-335-34X,0,false,,

This paper aims to contribute, in a preliminary way, to understand several of the implications in Sociology that this propagation of digital culture involves through a bibliographical review. We analyse several implications in dimensions such as the very purpose of Sociology (highlighting digital literacy and the level of democracy) and social research (addressing issues raised by the big date, the interdisciplinary dialogue between Sociology and other scientific areas, and new ethical dilemmas). We conclude that there are profound implications both in the research object and in the research processes of Sociology, which we will develop in later phases of the dissemination of this research. As a major implication, the reflective capacity of sociological knowledge is central to the preparation for this new reality, but, at the same time, also to a well-founded critical understanding of digital society.",7,3,101,106,Sociology; Digital literacy; Research Object; Digital culture; Digital society; Social research; Democracy; Engineering ethics,,,,,https://redfame.com/journal/index.php/ijsss/article/download/4221/4397 https://redfame.com/journal/index.php/ijsss/article/view/4221/4397 https://ideas.repec.org/a/rfa/journl/v7y2019i3p101-106.html https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/228083965.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.11114/ijsss.v7i3.4221,,10.11114/ijsss.v7i3.4221,2941032956,,0,022-146-159-357-985; 057-465-955-232-831; 065-454-781-114-304,3,true,cc-by,gold

The real-life observed data classes are rarely of the same size, and the intuition of presenting multiple examples of one class and then showing a few counterexamples may be very misleading in multimodal classification. Deep Learning models, when taught with overrepresentation, may produce incorrect inferring results, similar to stereotypes. The generic idea of stereotypes seems to be helpful for categorisation from the training point of view, but it has a negative influence on the inferring result. Authors evaluate a large dataset in various scenarios: overrepresentation of one or two classes, underrepresentation of some classes, and same-size (trimmed) classes. The presented research can be applied to any multiclassification applications, but it may be especially important in AI, where the classification, uncertainty and building new knowledge overlap. This paper presents specific 'decreases in accuracy' observed within multiclassification of unleveled datasets. The 'decreases in accuracy', named by the authors 'stereotypes', can also bring an inspiring insight into other fields and applications, not only multimodal sentiment analysis.",22,18,6739,,,Industry 5.0; artificial intelligence; cognitive technologies; digital stereotypes; feature measurement; machine learning,Artificial Intelligence; Deep Learning,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22186739,36146087,10.3390/s22186739,,PMC9500798,0,004-408-005-108-390; 007-103-174-852-120; 008-780-373-069-854; 009-133-000-340-061; 018-925-025-736-902; 019-235-045-945-371; 019-924-218-904-281; 020-588-773-417-373; 038-339-590-358-08X; 041-540-147-918-321; 047-659-835-339-821; 048-092-008-205-493; 053-591-547-250-936; 056-711-609-373-863; 071-281-855-084-73X; 079-460-097-847-690; 084-963-796-665-680; 091-421-458-658-768; 099-405-137-221-734; 103-539-131-867-354; 133-120-345-726-093; 139-902-813-789-453,0,true,cc-by,gold

Future factory floor workers will work in teams that include both human co-workers and smart machine actors. The visions of Industry 5.0 describe sustainable, resilient, and human-centered future factories that will require smart and resilient capabilities both from next-generation manufacturing systems and human operators. What kinds of approaches can help design these kinds of resilient human–machine teams and collaborations within them? In this paper, we analyze this design challenge, and we propose basing the design on the joint cognitive systems approach. The established joint cognitive systems approach can be complemented with approaches that support human centricity in the early phases of design, as well as in the development of continuously co-evolving human–machine teams. We propose approaches to observing and analyzing the collaboration in human–machine teams, developing the concept of operations with relevant stakeholders, and including ethical aspects in the design and development. We base our work on the joint cognitive systems approach and propose complementary approaches and methods, namely: actor–network theory, the concept of operations and ethically aware design.

010-590-914-224-912,Knowledge mapping of digital twin and physical internet in Supply Chain Management: A systematic literature review,,2022,journal article,International Journal of Production Economics,09255273; 18737579,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Tiep Nguyen; Quang Huy Duong; Truong Van Nguyen; You Zhu; Li Zhou,"Physical Internet (PI) is an open global logistics system of which components are hyperconnected for increased efficiency and sustainability. Digital twin (DT), referring to the virtual representation of a physical object, is well-perceived as a key driver in the development of PI-based Supply Chain Management (SCM). Due to the capabilities of real-time monitoring and evaluation of large-scale complex systems, significant research efforts have been made to exploit values of PI/DT in SCM. Despite this, the current literature remained largely unstructured and scattered due to a lack of systematic literature reviews to synergise research findings, analyse the evolution of research fronts and extract emerging trends in the field. To address this issue, the paper deploys a bibliometric knowledge mapping approach to provide a bird's eye view of the current research status in the PI/DT-SCM area. Using CiteSpace's keyword co-occurrence network, 518 journal articles are clustered into 10 key research streams on PI/DT applications in: job shop scheduling, smart manufacturing design, PI-based SCM, manufacturing virtualisation, information management, sustainability development, data analytics, manufacturing operations management, simulation and optimisation, and assembly process planning. Based on citation burst rate, keywords representing research frontiers of the PI/DT are detected and their temporal evolutions are discussed. Likewise, some identified emerging research trends are production process and system, robotics, computer architecture, and cost. Finally, seven future research directions are suggested, which emphasise on several PI/DT-related issues, including business ecosystem, sustainability development, SC downstream management, cognitive thinking in Industry 5.0, citizen twin in digital society, and SC resilience.",244,,108381,108381,Computer science; Fast fashion; Supply chain; Supply chain management; Process management; Analytics; The Internet; Sustainability; Knowledge management,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2021.108381,,10.1016/j.ijpe.2021.108381,,,0,000-375-548-189-568; 000-506-047-448-290; 000-634-489-297-828; 000-845-695-649-089; 001-479-581-905-784; 002-010-888-972-998; 002-215-790-525-136; 002-294-965-717-198; 003-951-406-265-053; 003-977-026-519-715; 005-221-388-388-364; 005-753-470-592-548; 006-388-016-871-145; 007-504-639-540-870; 007-857-490-001-29X; 007-943-326-313-110; 010-819-733-994-910; 011-018-575-862-58X; 011-064-867-391-975; 011-582-143-752-894; 012-700-032-298-335; 012-895-925-520-178; 012-923-514-429-842; 013-364-181-718-010; 014-269-884-650-180; 016-520-721-955-30X; 016-948-561-963-366; 020-096-656-286-019; 020-768-340-548-376; 021-166-031-376-003; 021-238-857-455-189; 021-386-049-291-029; 021-466-152-569-455; 021-768-506-002-91X; 022-811-319-743-955; 023-188-069-697-232; 023-699-532-367-134; 024-175-259-011-477; 024-564-990-473-792; 024-865-233-325-628; 025-146-310-226-558; 025-447-442-933-78X; 027-070-390-196-583; 027-335-161-889-58X; 027-419-187-690-825; 028-057-191-000-015; 028-172-891-776-803; 029-420-167-353-195; 029-660-351-012-836; 030-394-205-280-61X; 030-471-937-653-772; 030-686-554-327-070; 030-990-112-572-470; 032-265-800-999-962; 033-363-855-299-66X; 033-791-559-480-545; 034-797-930-862-008; 035-361-066-532-928; 035-612-321-981-450; 037-418-400-769-929; 037-638-296-138-514; 037-904-607-187-639; 037-945-118-531-575; 038-632-463-594-04X; 038-897-364-611-338; 044-472-737-404-82X; 045-116-019-239-52X; 046-420-103-164-690; 046-498-222-962-572; 047-291-734-468-955; 047-352-286-744-675; 047-947-690-992-868; 050-460-748-820-414; 053-390-569-461-215; 054-566-657-836-198; 054-872-615-622-461; 055-348-429-167-616; 056-178-641-627-082; 057-237-433-922-38X; 057-759-833-981-678; 057-789-040-348-458; 058-029-140-081-708; 058-184-877-686-509; 058-347-985-375-242; 059-946-465-120-677; 060-147-376-847-596; 061-962-132-890-210; 064-245-906-706-964; 064-400-499-357-900; 064-690-263-092-908; 065-085-518-912-738; 065-206-145-259-569; 066-174-869-656-116; 066-771-446-570-957; 067-164-171-987-113; 067-253-505-565-549; 067-703-009-019-085; 069-184-778-569-007; 071-361-455-780-656; 072-610-779-757-007; 074-687-132-320-961; 076-340-862-785-218; 077-571-063-166-597; 079-109-874-245-670; 080-436-406-243-416; 082-530-114-084-445; 082-707-661-201-023; 084-850-709-972-260; 085-912-259-715-810; 088-312-209-611-554; 090-731-522-534-055; 091-203-425-735-952; 093-080-120-142-422; 093-685-209-110-090; 095-096-161-740-778; 095-256-672-289-333; 095-366-405-250-466; 096-355-286-600-445; 098-762-208-761-893; 099-866-638-042-779; 100-742-208-652-701; 101-943-376-682-990; 104-495-326-573-684; 105-329-947-846-748; 105-941-642-967-558; 108-005-596-606-248; 108-567-859-928-412; 109-360-319-818-608; 110-745-539-662-230; 117-032-248-723-624; 117-047-936-699-244; 117-483-387-688-980; 118-344-159-936-803; 119-312-052-762-583; 119-717-088-654-176; 119-781-040-661-744; 123-075-792-876-314; 124-187-743-925-055; 125-546-286-836-572; 130-067-918-478-981; 131-206-117-846-231; 135-829-002-164-149; 138-684-993-786-479; 140-266-834-889-884; 141-770-447-621-043; 142-258-117-619-913; 142-423-808-319-246; 142-610-776-896-885; 143-310-125-382-890; 144-237-316-313-335; 145-037-125-082-79X; 148-802-154-845-367; 150-642-090-497-296; 152-664-153-882-037; 160-081-115-291-67X; 160-165-859-531-734; 166-418-707-830-779; 169-607-927-978-507,7,true,,green

The SSWM-related causal interrelationships within the proposed hierarchical structure, and critical barriers for the practical improvement and enhancement of SSWM performance are identified as preference enriching both literature and practices. In nature, the hierarchical structure is with the causal interrelationships under uncertainties. The perspective empowers the creation of a new biosphere based on technological progress, but in the sustainable solid waste management field, it is difficult to encounter and shape the systematized processes due to barriers and challenges. To address this shortcoming, this study evaluates the technical challenges faced in the field of sustainable solid waste management toward society 5.0. The valid attributes are usually described the qualitative information. The fuzzy Delphi method is applied to acquire the valid and reliable attributes. Fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory experiment is to visualize the causal interrelationships among the attributes. Choquet integral with respect to the nonadditive attributes over the valid set provides an overall perspective function. The results establish an understanding of sustainable solid waste management barriers in the perspectives under uncertainties. Community uncertainty, policy and regulation problems, city architecture, and technology interaction are the factors that influence sustainable performance. In practices, (1) diverse disciplines and sectors in local, national, and global communities; (2) a lack of mobility and reliability; (3) mass production and mass consumption; (4) an insufficient level of artificial intelligence application; and (5) failures related to data management and security hinder the improvement of sustainable solid waste management toward society 5.0.

However, the organic integration of the financial industry and the Internet of Things lacks relevant standards, and there is no appropriate work summary to coordinate the formulation of these standards. This work aims to effectively improve the reliability of information acquisition and the accuracy of data processing in the financial industry. In addition, this work also investigates papers and standards related to financial intelligence technology in recent years and statistically analyzes the evaluation indicators of AI research papers. Then, a standard evaluation framework is proposed for financial intelligence technology, which is evaluated for performance verification. The comparative experiments demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of the financial intelligence standard model reaches 95.44%, and the prediction error is substantially smaller than that of the other model algorithms. The financial intelligence standard model can make accurate predictions on alternative financial data and has high reliability and validity. The model can provide an experimental reference for intellectual development in the financial field and enable participants to improve work efficiency and standards throughout the process of developing intelligent financial technology.",7,4,100229,100229,Computer science; Reliability (semiconductor); Field (mathematics); Financial services; Process (computing); Work (physics); Vision; Finance; Data mining; Artificial intelligence; Data science,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jik.2022.100229,,10.1016/j.jik.2022.100229,,,0,003-408-980-642-840; 006-098-680-452-509; 007-763-570-234-002; 008-251-678-155-290; 016-823-808-422-264; 017-643-954-183-191; 021-018-934-451-268; 037-085-263-278-441; 037-092-041-641-546; 038-929-334-558-840; 040-363-385-526-410; 043-694-014-361-413; 044-608-345-722-917; 049-931-401-391-879; 050-451-731-708-392; 065-336-138-593-249; 073-086-812-366-218; 078-513-000-033-413; 079-178-693-538-342; 079-205-045-518-125; 079-914-496-911-622; 091-425-469-902-605; 095-752-153-495-576; 097-114-081-942-846; 104-384-756-335-748; 105-514-421-958-379; 107-510-070-079-472; 108-076-801-964-158; 109-282-403-682-861; 117-856-566-119-133; 120-386-541-992-571; 122-391-547-616-71X; 163-618-531-649-681; 169-019-259-844-253; 170-001-500-272-707; 186-348-886-564-465,0,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

Nikitina; Irina M. Chernukha,"Mathematization of research is one of the most effective methods of virtual substantiation of foodstuff recipe and technology. This approach allows creating a product that meets consumer's individual needs, i.e. personalized foodstuff (ethnicity, cultural preferences, regional and environmental characteristics, lifestyle), and at the same time reducing the time and cost of decision-making. The article discusses the hypothesis that the “digital twin” of a food product is a virtual model of the product, namely its mathematical model (simulation model). A simulation model is a logical and mathematical description of a food product that is used to conduct a computerized experiment in order to design desired characteristics and properties. The “digital twin” combines all variety of factors from chemical composition, functional and technological properties to organoleptic indicators. The application of the “digital twin” model of the foodstuff will allow: (1) reacting quickly to changes in the composition, properties and types of raw ingredients, (2) adjusting the product recipe in response to changes in consumer preferences, (3) designing products with a given chemical composition, nutritional value and functional orientation, (4) creating functional, specialized products taking into account the metabolism of nutrients (ethnicity, cultural preferences, health status and clinical factors). Products adapted to the needs of small categories of people will help reducing the risks for those who already have diseases, and will meet the needs of those who would like to make their diet more appropriate to individual needs. The proposed approach to creating a model of the “digital twin” of the foodstuff includes several stages. The first stage involves optimization of the nutritional and biological value of the designed product. The second stage is related to designing the food product’s structural forms. But even if the recipe of a food product is optimally selected in the first stage, it does not guarantee its transformation during processing into a stable system with the required structural, mechanical, functional and technological parameters. Evaluation of the developed food product’s efficiency is possible only by analysing numerous and various parameters and indicators.

The general scheme of the integrated model of sustainable and socio-humanitarian development in the global system is proposed, which the authors call the noosphere model of sustainable and safe development as an important fundamental platform for the design and creation of AIS. In the XXI century education, science and innova- tive technologies becomes the «basis» of the spiritual and material reproduction of man, transforming the society of the XXI century into an educational society, ensures compliance with the law of advanced development of human quality, quality of social intelligence and quality of educational systems in society. noosphere evolution (Субетто, 2008). Industry 4.0 is the next stage in the digitalization of production technologies with the accelerated introduction of new developments and cyberphysical systems, which is changing business models. Accordingly, Industry 4.0 as a separate segment of digital manufacturing technologies takes its place among other digital sectors. The analysis of the Strategies and Concepts developed in the world in modern directions: innovative economy, digital economy, artificial intelli- gence, Industry 4.0 and others is carried out in the work.

The main scientific and technological factors in the 21st century will be the development of: Artificial Intelligence, Nano Technologies, Bio-Media Technologies, Cognitive Technologies and Socio-Humanitarian Technologies. More specifically – this is the modern development of Innovative Technologies: «NBIC SH». Therefore, it is necessary to note the importance of taking into account the principle of I2K2+SH, ie: Intellectualization, Integration, Convergence, Coevolution and Socio- humanitarian technologies. It is important and necessary to take into account modern principles of designing a su- stainable and secure AIS and solving the problem of Harmonization between 2 worlds: Real and Virtual, especially in their hybridization. Our immediate future is a hybrid nonlinear world. Note that digitalization, artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics will be the main drivers of global economic growth by 2030E. An important paradigm and platform is the Integrated System: for Industry 4.0, DE and AI, taking into account the complex principle of I2K2+SH.

As an example, we looked at the resource-sharing problem typical of economic activities and assumed the distribution of individual actions to define the (1) norm function fostered through mutual comparison of value/action ratio based on the equity theory (progressive tax-like), (2) norm function proportional to resource utilization (proportional tax-like) and (3) fixed norm function independent of resource utilization (fixed tax-like). By carrying out numerical simulation, we showed that the progressive tax-like norm function (i) does not increase disparity for the distribution of the actions, unlike the other norm functions, and (ii) has high resource productivity and low Gini coefficient. Therefore the progressive tax-like norm function has the highest sustainability and fairness.",7,3,96,114,Norm (social); Mathematical optimization; Gini coefficient; Decision-making models; Mutual recognition; Resource utilization; Mathematics; Equity theory; Sustainability; Resource productivity,,,,,https://redfame.com/journal/index.php/aef/article/view/4825 https://redfame.com/journal/index.php/aef/article/download/4825/4986 https://ideas.repec.org/a/rfa/aefjnl/v7y2020i3p96-114.html https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/322535333.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.11114/aef.v7i3.4825,,10.11114/aef.v7i3.4825,3105356719; 3007379660,,0,004-545-338-240-85X; 007-191-349-791-474; 007-437-980-745-880; 010-332-589-194-999; 011-882-911-145-929; 012-962-885-974-665; 045-212-803-345-983; 054-065-378-815-209; 062-735-979-667-571; 063-725-226-097-989; 063-862-591-134-240; 070-733-823-215-158; 073-933-963-335-712; 078-341-709-997-73X; 078-362-374-834-789; 081-050-134-994-930; 086-205-801-972-088; 095-975-856-131-048; 096-623-595-192-834; 109-991-058-110-214; 124-784-188-982-725; 152-126-041-220-508; 156-193-184-347-069; 156-765-044-924-988; 159-419-280-815-190; 175-602-270-496-697,3,true,cc-by,gold

To address all issues of these systems, comprehensive approaches of transdisciplinary and post-normal sciences are needed. This article tries to re-conceptualize emerging energy systems using Robert Rosen’s theory of anticipatory system and introduces the concept of the anticipatory smart energy system (ASES). Three important features of an ASES are described and socio-technical considerations for realization of these features are discussed. The article also considers realization of such systems under society 5.0 paradigm and spime techno-culture. In ASESs, the identity of users evolves and new identities are created for energy users, based on the production, consumption, storage, and distributed management of energy.

They themselves act as an agent in a connected world, understood as a multi-agent system, in which the Laplacian spectrum plays an important role since it can define the connection of the complex networks as well as depict the robustness. In addition, the Laplacian spectrum can locally check the controllability and observability of a dynamic controlled network, etc. This paper presents a new method, which is based on the Augmented Lagrange based Alternating Direction Inexact Newton (ALADIN) method, to faster the convergence rate of the Laplacian Spectrum Estimation via factorization of the average consensus matrices, that are expressed as Laplacian-based matrices problems. Herein, the non-zero distinct Laplacian eigenvalues are the inverse of the stepsizes {αt,t=1,2,…} of those matrices. Therefore, the problem now is to carry out the agreement on the stepsize values for all agents in the given network while ensuring the factorization of average consensus matrices to be accomplished. Furthermore, in order to obtain the entire Laplacian spectrum, it is necessary to estimate the relevant multiplicities of these distinct eigenvalues. Consequently, a non-convex optimization problem is formed and solved using ALADIN method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated through the simulation results and the comparison with the Lagrange-based method in advance.",10,16,5625,,Optimization problem; Eigenvalues and eigenvectors; Factorization; Applied mathematics; Complex network; Observability; Computer science; Controllability; Rate of convergence; Robustness (computer science),,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/16/5625/pdf https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/16/5625,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app10165625,,10.3390/app10165625,3049318061,,0,007-406-093-412-244; 008-244-703-863-841; 009-793-573-285-761; 017-084-836-808-439; 035-640-580-921-338; 045-636-020-326-312; 047-492-764-561-465; 051-594-268-211-740; 060-874-139-028-889; 074-210-904-932-469; 076-603-561-219-089; 086-845-058-010-952; 120-798-168-866-091; 126-234-319-395-018; 135-801-307-198-599; 145-257-512-662-254; 172-911-099-061-06X,1,true,cc-by,gold

A well-designed alarm system can reduce the workload of operators parallel with the support of the production, which is in line with the approach of Industry 5.0. Using Process Mining tools to explore the operator-related event scenarios requires a goal-oriented log file format that contains the start and the end of the alarms along with the triggered operator actions. The key contribution of the work is that a method is presented that transforms the historical event data of control systems into goal-oriented log files used as inputs of process mining algorithms. The applicability of the proposed process mining-based method is presented concerning the analysis of a hydrofluoric acid alkylation plant.

For this reason, our research goal was to analyze the key performance indicators to investigate the economic and social sustainability of the changes in production. Methodology: The combination of official (World Bank, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) and publicly available (Federal Reserve Economic Data, Industrial Federation of Robotics) data was used for statistical data processing, including comparison, correlation, cross-correlation and vector autoregression analysis, to present the past develop­ments and also to predict future trends within the U.S. manufacturing sector. Results: In contrast to robust industry robotization observed in the 2008–2018 period, the share of manufacturing output and employment declined. Nonetheless, the vector autoregression model forecast shows, that the U.S. manu­facturing sector has arrived at a turning point, after which robotization can increase employment and labor productivi­ty of workers, while also stimulating further growth of their education levels. Conclusion: The transition to Industry 4.0 has a major impact on increasing demands for new knowledge and skills for increased productivity. Accordingly, forecasted growths of analyzed manufacturing indicators suggest that negative impacts of robotization in the recent past were only temporary, due to the entrance to the Industry 4.0 era. Nonetheless, additional policies to support sustainable industry development are required.

The “Industrie 4.0” initiative declared by Germany in 2011 was soon followed by the „Advanced Manufactured Partnership” program of the U.S., as well as by the “Made in China 2025” initiative for the advancement of the productive sector launched by the People’s Republic of China and the “Industria 2016” vision of Italy. The “Society 5.0” strategy of Japan announced in 2018 symbolizes both the destructing and the constructive power of the fourth industrial revolution which will result in a complete restructuring of all fields of economy and society. The evolution of Industry 4.0 is parallel to the conscious efforts of many European governments to develop their own start-up ecosystems. These start-ups face significant challenges, but at the same time, they are the means to support changes. Technology-oriented start-up companies (also referred as early stage start-ups in Hungary) are not only expected to prove their own reason for existence, but should also support the complex changes of the corporate sector. This paper is based on a survey among early stage start-up companies, having received angel investment from technology incubators. The survey has focused on how these start-ups see of the significance of Industry 4.0, what differences are evident compared to traditional companies, and what management competencies are thought to be required to realize their growth strategy.",50,9,40,48,Humanities; Political science; Productive sector,,,,,http://unipub.lib.uni-corvinus.hu/4234/1/VT_2019n9p40.pdf http://unipub.lib.uni-corvinus.hu/4234/ https://core.ac.uk/download/228207943.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.14267/veztud.2019.09.05,,10.14267/veztud.2019.09.05,2973955768,,0,,1,true,,gold

This discourse focuses on the lens of Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and Machine Learning of Artificial Intelligence (MLAI). To some extent several companies have embarked Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0 within Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Through the wave of IoT Technology, Industries are adopting automated machinery. Predictive maintenance (PM) is indispensable not only toward the machines"" vitality and longevity purpose, but also toward the human error reduction. This paper elaborates its discourse of Industry 4.0 and Society through the lens of CBM and MLAI. The mentioned Machine Learning, in this paper, refers to research methodology, as methodological frameworks. Those frameworks comprise several phases, which are: 1. Equipment Analysis; 2. Data Evaluation; 3. Data Selection and Process; 4. Modeling; 5. Decision Support Model Evaluation. The MLAI techniques are based upon the identification of behaviour patterns. This identification comprises datasets that exclude mathematical models or prior historical knowledge. The discourse in this paper intertwines CBM process and MLAI through data cleaning and processing, features stratification and extraction, model stratification and validation. This paper elaborates two renowned maintenance approaches which are preventive and corrective maintenance. Discourse in this paper focuses on corrective action, known as predictive maintenance (PM), or condition based maintenance (CBM) within Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM). CBM is chosen as the most desirable strategy, as it involves the intervention as the consequence of the machine breakdown. It also provides cost savings toward spare parts consumption, and optimizes production.",852,1,012022,,Decision support system; Machine learning; Corrective maintenance; Artificial intelligence; Spare part; Human error assessment and reduction technique; Condition-based maintenance; Industry 4.0; Computer science; Process (engineering); Predictive maintenance,,,,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/852/1/012022/meta http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MS&E..852a2022R/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1757-899x/852/1/012022,,10.1088/1757-899x/852/1/012022,3043882549,,0,014-573-589-124-360; 019-776-642-838-912; 037-194-857-262-669; 043-596-743-446-469; 068-359-314-694-761; 116-593-224-234-432; 118-677-841-205-160; 129-978-204-955-629; 131-646-071-928-459,2,true,,gold

Hence, digital transformation becomes a pillar of industrial policy, known in Europe as “Industry 4.0,” in China as “made in China 2025,” in Asia as “Smart Cities,” in Japan as “Society 5.0,” and in North America as “Industrial Internet.” These transformations will change the industrial landscape, toward Quality 4.0 and therefore, our lives. The presented research was conducted on quality management employees in Portugal and it aims to analyze if such employees have the perception of the impact of Industry 4.0 in the quality management profession and the required and needed skills. After analyzing the answered questionnaires, 90 results were considered valid. This is the sample of our study. Simultaneously, the goal of this research is also to review and analyze the main topics in progress related to quality management for the fourth industrial revolution and how quality emerges of this change. The professionals that work on quality management must have creative thinking, be leaders, know how to communicate and work as a team, as well as, to have knowledge and understanding of ICT (Information and Communications Technology), and main pillars of Industry 4.0. These are the main findings. Besides that, they must know how to motivate their work teams, be open to change, know how to use Big Data to make decisions and above all, they must know how to manage conflicts. In addition, quality professionals must promote the design and production of first class products, be the defenders of their customers within the organization, and finally, they must create value for the stakeholders.",13,11,6149,,Digital transformation; Business; Work (electrical); Quality (business); Know-how; Public relations; Information and Communications Technology; Quality management; Big data; Industrial policy,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/11/6149 https://www.investigo.biblioteca.uvigo.es/xmlui/handle/11093/2521 https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/11/6149/pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jsusta/v13y2021i11p6149-d565447.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13116149,,10.3390/su13116149,3168748196,,0,003-168-805-535-255; 003-914-072-470-379; 004-146-608-578-044; 004-178-537-370-014; 004-412-105-566-665; 005-045-583-186-047; 008-272-192-984-104; 010-571-880-322-384; 011-109-053-887-644; 011-731-557-276-257; 012-620-660-347-863; 012-807-850-644-535; 013-268-120-302-468; 016-104-650-974-50X; 016-924-115-700-850; 019-470-067-414-619; 019-608-619-740-068; 019-829-323-569-483; 020-679-888-685-232; 023-718-843-363-609; 025-624-866-598-174; 026-355-539-887-693; 026-377-023-826-731; 026-930-195-193-249; 027-682-558-172-305; 031-401-352-695-814; 033-901-703-558-402; 034-033-443-390-330; 035-760-574-365-589; 037-898-931-569-825; 038-196-787-346-28X; 039-276-529-993-245; 040-954-000-855-374; 042-237-735-532-286; 045-937-011-493-118; 049-447-342-279-582; 049-501-679-576-659; 052-260-957-798-168; 053-870-301-232-49X; 054-939-210-666-021; 056-540-396-639-061; 063-046-666-988-49X; 063-577-492-144-272; 064-232-952-498-18X; 067-555-889-280-940; 068-659-592-842-845; 071-412-527-695-221; 073-891-208-025-128; 074-895-567-621-479; 076-625-479-604-532; 078-554-666-685-478; 079-725-390-592-069; 083-118-071-766-500; 090-639-139-222-68X; 091-928-035-899-634; 094-115-753-654-923; 095-821-715-111-658; 104-963-683-392-202; 110-452-583-393-278; 112-488-047-085-113; 116-962-226-076-678; 119-421-095-852-469; 119-767-738-149-24X; 123-365-319-409-994; 134-477-067-632-705; 135-553-141-898-826; 138-586-215-590-200; 142-642-370-100-839; 146-346-698-365-266; 149-414-150-110-218; 150-547-783-407-083; 153-700-689-814-376; 154-603-189-302-798; 162-153-150-726-82X; 164-405-595-714-646; 166-743-648-149-404; 167-956-416-881-546; 174-941-184-679-323,22,true,cc-by,gold

018-537-060-605-321,Identifying industry 5.0 contributions to sustainable development: A strategy roadmap for delivering sustainability values,,2022,journal article,Sustainable Production and Consumption,23525509,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Morteza Ghobakhloo; Mohammad Iranmanesh; Muhammad Faraz Mubarak; Mobashar Mubarik; Abderahman Rejeb; Mehrbakhsh Nilashi,"Scholars believe that the newly introduced Industry 5.0 has the potential to move beyond the profit-centered productivity of Industry 4.0 and to promote sustainable development goals such as human-centricity, socio-environmental sustainability, and resilience. However, little has been done to understand how this ill-defined phenomenon may deliver its indented sustainability values despite these speculative promises. To address this knowledge gap, the present study developed a strategy roadmap that explains the mechanism by which Industry 5.0 delivers its intended sustainable development functions. The study first developed and introduced the Industry 5.0 reference model that describes the technical and functional properties of this phenomenon. The study further conducted a content-centric synthesis of the literature and identified the sustainable development functions of Industry 5.0. Next, the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique was employed to identify the sequential relationships among the functions and construct the Industry 5.0-enabled model of sustainable development. The ISM involved collecting the opinions of 11 Industry 5.0 experts through expert panel meetings. Results revealed that Industry 5.0 delivers sustainable development values through 16 functions. Circular intelligent products, employee technical assistance, intelligent automation, open sustainable innovation, renewable integration, and supply chain adaptability are examples of the functions identified. These functions are highly interrelated and should be developed in a specific order so that the synergies and complementarities among them would maximize the sustainable development value gains. The roadmap to Industry 5.0-driven sustainability developed in this study is expected to provide a better understanding of ways Industry 5.0 can contribute to sustainable development, explaining how the development of its functions should be managed to maximize their synergies and contribution to the intended sustainability values.

The purpose of the study was to show that digitalization is qualitatively changing some aspects of social life. Methodology. Determination of digitalization means, degree and consequences of influence on some aspects of social life was carried out by analysis of work results of some sites/portals devoted to events of World War II. Results. Digitalization nowadays is a process being quickly spread all around the world. It covers a wide range of human activities: business, industry, agriculture, education, healthcare, culture and social life. The process being very new, complex and challenging demands developing of a high (state) level strategy such as “ Industrie 4.0” - one of ten projects for State Hi-Tech Strategy of Germany up 2020 or “Digital Economy of the Russian Federation”. Moreover it becomes obvious that digitalization influences not only “production” but also society. In 2016 Japan released concept “Society 5.0” - a large plan of social transformations. Interesting and remarkable results in fostering some aspects of social life were also reached in the Russian Federation during preparation of Great Victory 75th anniversary celebration. Conclusion. It is demonstrated that massive digitalization of personal archives (photos, documents, family/participant of events stories, eyewitness accounts) as well as access to archived data of state institutions and possibility to translate all information for free has fostered qualitatively new personal and social attitude to remarkable historical events.",17,2,134,145,World War II; Health care; Work (electrical); Political science; Digital economy; State (polity); Victory; Public relations; Process (engineering); Plan (drawing),,,,,http://journals.rudn.ru/informatization-education/article/view/24164/18426 http://journals.rudn.ru/informatization-education/article/download/24164/18426,http://dx.doi.org/10.22363/2312-8631-2020-17-2-134-145,,10.22363/2312-8631-2020-17-2-134-145,3045766168,,0,,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

In addition, increasing sweet corn production can also be done by managing pollen to ensure the availability of pollen and the success of pollination by giving boron elements (Lordkaew et al., 2011). The research was conducted on the land owned by PT. Wira Agro Nusantara Sejahtera which is located in the village of Jl. Papaya, Lamong, Pare, Kediri for 4 months starting from November 2020 to February 2021. This research was conducted using a Factorial Randomized Block Design (RBD) consisting of 2 factors. The first factor is the application time of paclobutrazol (U) which consists of 2 levels, namely U1: 30 day after plant (DAP) and U2: 40 DAP. The second factor is the dose of boron fertilizer (B) consisting of 3 levels, namely B0: 0 kg / ha, B1: 10 kg / ha, and B2: 15 kg / ha. The results showed that the application time of paclobutrazol did not affect almost all parameters, except on plant height and weight of 1000 seeds. Meanwhile, the boron dose showed a very significant effect on all production parameters, but did not have a significant effect on the germination rate and growth speed of sweet corn seeds. The interaction between paclobutrazol application time and boron dose did not significantly affect all parameters, except for the weight parameter of 1000 seeds. Dose of boron as much as 15 kg / ha gave the best effect on cob length, cob diameter, cob weight, seed weight per cob, number of seeds per cob, 1000 grain weight, and sweet corn seed production per hectare.

Such collaborations are deeply anchored in the vision of Society 5.0, which promotes a human-centered society that integrates virtual and physical real spaces to resolve social problems, and Industry 5.0, which promotes intelligent manufacturing processes through collaboration between humans and cyber-physical systems. It is expected that real-time H2M/R collaborations will drive new technologies that facilitate the low-latency exchange of control signals and haptic feedback between humans and machines/robots. The low-latency constraints for real-time interaction will, however, place limits on deployable distance and the flexibility of adding new machines/robots to the system. The scalability of H2M/R collaborations across large geographical distances that also allow rapid onboarding of new machines/robots is therefore an open challenge. This article focuses on global-local AI coordinated learning (GLAD), a solution framework that supports the dynamic addition of new machines/robots and their rapid onboarding. The GLAD framework is based on learning the traffic characteristics and correlation of supported robots/machines at the local edge and global cloud. Harnessing data samples from a real H2M/R application for training and validation, GLAD enables human operators to remotely control machines/robots over extended distances through accurately forecasting their haptic feedback. By globally coordinating and sharing this learning across the network, up to 72 percent of the time can be saved when onboarding new machines/robots.",36,2,124,130,Robot; Computer science; Scalability; Artificial intelligence; Human–computer interaction; Haptic technology,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/mnet.003.2100602,,10.1109/mnet.003.2100602,,,0,010-082-817-180-371; 017-415-713-662-955; 023-626-432-014-836; 023-859-386-843-111; 026-369-100-651-075; 064-396-419-566-309; 070-861-982-357-096; 099-025-960-684-052; 155-270-091-495-601,0,false,,

The rapid development of new technologies often outpaces the ability of organizations to align their development priorities with it and effectively take advantage of new opportunities, which leads to the need to navigate the changing business environment in time and develop a relevant development strategy. With so many technological changes, changing workforce demands, and social and regulatory priorities, there is a need to define guiding principles to help set the course for the digital industry. Industry 5.0 has become the basis for revising the future of energy, manufacturing, and mobility of supply chains, which rest on the foundations laid by Industry 4.0. The weaknesses of the Industry 4.0 concept, especially in terms of the role of a human in ""smart"" production and ensuring sustainable development are outlined. Accordingly, the expediency of further research and implementation of the Industry 5.0 concept is substantiated. On the basis of the conducted research on the implementation of Industry 5.0 and the world trends of industrial development, the author justifies the feasibility of reorienting production and business activities to human-centeredness as a new norm, strengthening sustainability, in particular, careful planning of stabilization measures in case of disruption of the global value chains – from factory facilities to network supplier, to transport channels, to regulatory and geopolitical changes, ensuring sustainability with manufacturers rethinking their impact on natural resources in connection with the expansion of the regulatory and legislative framework and investors' attention to reducing carbon emissions and negative impact on the environment.</jats:p>",,3(155),41,46,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.36818/2071-4653-2022-3-7,,10.36818/2071-4653-2022-3-7,,,0,080-811-727-052-09X; 151-713-702-079-012,0,false,,

One of the changes is how people get information from a large amount of data to be used in the public development sector. Public policy, as a solution to solve various public problems, needs to be supported by accurate data and information facts. With a massive amount of data, this has an impact on public sector organizations to be able to store and analyze various types of information for public policies consideration. The term 'Society 5.0' has emerged, a concept that refers to revolution in people's lives through the use of technology by considering the humanities aspect. The potential for the huge benefits of big data technology is interesting to know as to whether big data can be used for the public policy formulation process. Therefore, this article will provide an overview of the implications of big data for the public policy process in society. This research uses qualitative method with literature study approach. The data came from websites and government documents related to the use of big data in public policies, analyzed using the NVivo12 Plus application. The emergence of big data, as a basis for making public policy, can be utilized for analysis, which includes social data analysis, historical data analysis, and predictive data analysis which can influence accuracy in the policy decision making.

025-055-813-171-364,BoSMoS: A Blockchain-Based Status Monitoring System for Defending Against Unauthorized Software Updating in Industrial Internet of Things,,2020,journal article,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,23274662; 23722541,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),United States,Sen He; Wei Ren; Tianqing Zhu; Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo,"The role of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) in critical infrastructure sectors, such as power, chemistry, and manufacturing, will be increasingly important as we move toward Industry 5.0. For example, IIoT devices are deployed in factories to help the manufacturing companies (e.g., automotive) gain in-depth insight into the various states of production, and thus improving production efficiency and achieving cost reductions. However, malicious code may compromise IIoT devices if either the devices are exposed to outside or unexposed inner devices are updated unauthentically. Due to their limited resources and features, it is challenging to implement strong security solutions for such embedded devices. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based software status monitoring system, called BoSMoS. The system is designed to monitor the software status of IIoT devices to detect and respond to identified malicious behaviors (e.g., intrusions). BoSMoS takes a snapshot of the statue of monitored software and monitors its file system calls. In order to ensure the software integrity information, we use blockchain as the distributed ledger to store a snapshot of software status. The blockchain network of BoSMoS can employ different consensus algorithms. We also evaluate the performance of BoSMoS, in terms of exception response delay, resistance performance to various intrusions, and scalability. The experimental results justify that BoSMoS is practical and sound. In addition, the evaluation of scalability and security demonstrates that the system can carry deployment of large-scale IIoT devices and can guarantee authenticated software updating, as well as detect unauthorized software status.",7,2,948,959,Software deployment; Software; Blockchain; File system; Critical infrastructure; Computer security; Computer science; Scalability; Automotive industry,,,,Major Scientific and Technological Special Project of Guizhou Province; Open Funding of Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Public Big Data; Open Funding of Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Public Big Data; Open Funding of Hubei Provincial Key Laboratory of Intelligent Geo-Information Processing,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8869742 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/iotj/iotj7.html#HeRZC20,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/jiot.2019.2947339,,10.1109/jiot.2019.2947339,2980633110,,0,001-780-810-658-450; 002-731-068-436-532; 007-553-069-846-19X; 009-983-560-064-14X; 013-188-274-001-772; 014-241-307-740-51X; 019-225-229-781-384; 037-022-562-292-915; 038-252-218-043-661; 038-352-946-229-93X; 040-802-878-229-395; 043-825-005-000-998; 045-968-687-151-048; 051-116-127-516-560; 055-109-192-558-089; 058-504-450-135-150; 059-209-937-262-199; 065-395-818-630-920; 066-055-764-330-214; 070-113-364-206-908; 089-177-298-471-393; 098-382-797-336-494; 100-759-935-594-000; 102-618-216-277-766; 106-890-314-459-668; 134-326-251-131-670; 135-040-647-026-976; 144-796-391-638-165; 157-522-909-138-24X,33,false,,

These technologies improve working conditions, create new business models, and increase both productivity and firm quality production. However, they can also improve life and society as a whole. This new perspective, oriented toward social and global well-being, is called Society 5.0. As has happened for all past industrial revolutions, Industry 4.0 will support the transition to a different society, i.e., Society 5.0. In this transition, open innovation and value co-creation can play an important role. The aim of the study was twofold: to examine how Industry 4.0 features and enabling technologies can support the transition to Society 5.0 and to investigate the roles of both open innovation and value co-creation within this transition. A conceptual framework was developed to jointly consider for the first time Industry 4.0, Society 5.0, open innovation, and value co-creation, which are all challenging issues that firms must cope with nowadays. Managers could profit from these insights to design ad hoc strategies in order to benefit from the opportunities emerging from this transition and overcome the main related challenges.",12,21,8943,,Conceptual framework; Business; Open innovation; Profit (economics); Industry 4.0; Co-creation; Industrial organization; Business model; Big data; Advanced manufacturing,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/21/8943 https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/21/8943/pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jsusta/v12y2020i21p8943-d435842.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12218943,,10.3390/su12218943,3094751573,,0,001-176-949-317-166; 001-937-465-603-426; 002-311-018-495-154; 002-411-915-669-968; 005-220-873-251-762; 006-675-752-138-373; 007-574-624-257-144; 008-302-910-246-857; 013-531-466-197-883; 015-447-374-583-278; 016-303-567-431-004; 016-774-596-734-830; 019-763-285-018-963; 020-969-308-135-679; 021-588-736-673-286; 023-935-252-395-394; 024-863-314-645-595; 025-445-829-094-029; 028-028-892-088-002; 029-333-074-857-655; 030-424-393-136-862; 031-446-952-817-490; 034-476-070-261-685; 035-231-989-556-279; 036-297-026-204-017; 036-681-732-980-212; 037-594-622-036-731; 038-964-429-089-518; 040-778-348-220-273; 040-789-926-270-357; 040-954-000-855-374; 042-622-995-382-852; 042-997-309-153-234; 044-119-959-146-339; 046-246-731-976-891; 046-382-517-518-693; 047-357-116-137-074; 052-961-258-603-888; 056-990-589-398-610; 058-666-003-191-603; 062-757-415-379-846; 063-135-384-962-122; 064-042-765-914-689; 064-542-948-840-61X; 068-490-188-515-163; 072-286-099-287-345; 073-325-440-578-871; 074-895-567-621-479; 076-991-386-599-906; 081-288-888-911-476; 081-937-750-673-601; 082-059-683-653-001; 085-300-287-100-525; 085-738-769-698-108; 087-215-530-709-098; 088-244-676-132-622; 088-281-655-337-496; 089-197-091-271-085; 092-147-288-927-925; 092-609-497-400-592; 093-670-206-119-602; 097-603-057-392-60X; 099-525-058-823-266; 100-124-216-391-558; 100-628-835-997-419; 102-443-972-671-847; 102-838-274-798-046; 106-740-230-449-952; 107-242-490-062-062; 115-847-590-573-793; 116-467-819-785-092; 117-469-885-123-201; 117-484-712-607-828; 126-473-723-473-477; 126-821-861-406-828; 134-477-067-632-705; 135-553-141-898-826; 137-059-616-282-11X; 139-204-566-527-086; 140-773-897-108-949; 144-670-467-410-017; 146-187-024-059-654; 149-269-099-266-71X; 149-531-816-526-90X; 154-889-013-873-278; 182-004-071-343-835,36,true,cc-by,gold

It has brought us to Pharma 5.0, a combination of traditional biomanufacturing practices and industrial production with the latest smart technology and artificial intelligence use. These revolutionary changes can be applied to all production line aspects, from drug conception to final consumption by the consumers while still acknowledging the digitalization challenges and security issues associated. In this chapter, the ultimate integration of human and machine is discussed with the invention of bionics, for example, bionic vision and bionic limbs. The role of technology in these new manufacturing systems, such as small-scale agile manufacturing and mass production with advances occurring on the factory floor, are also detailed in this chapter. A few challenges still remain, including the impact on job security, ethical issues, problems with data processing and challenges in designing for human-computer interaction, which also need to be identified, analyzed and overcome before a transformation to the Fifth Industrial Revolution can be realized. Finally, prospective research into human-computer integration and further personalization is studied to foresee and predict imminent technologies that will become significant in Industry 5.0.",,,135,160,Engineering management; Engineering; Personalization; Biomanufacturing; Job security; Agile manufacturing; Industrial Revolution; Industrial production; Bionics; Production line,,,,,https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781003080671-7-7/medicine-pharmaceuticals-biomanufacturing-industry-5-0-zahra-nashath-doris-ying-ying-tang-kit-wayne-chew-pau-loke-show,http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9781003080671-7-7,,10.1201/9781003080671-7-7,3160660397,,0,142-761-009-318-070,0,false,,

The main goals of digitalization are the development of innovations focused on the development of society 5.0, ensuring the free flow of data and capital. Considering the Mundell-Fleming model application as the instrument to support economic welfare it should be admitted the “impossible trinity” of the model and the lack of research to solve it. The paper investigates the Mundell-Fleming dilemma solution on the ground of digitalization. The research methodology is based on fundamental tenets of modern economics and general scientific methods, namely: induction, deduction, dialectical method and systematic approach, analysis and synthesis – all of these for analyzing the process of digitalization and to establish the principles, forms and foundations of the Mundell-Fleming model application in the digital dimension, systematization and generalization (to substantiate the phenomenon of digitalization), abstract-logical method (for recent tendencies substantiation), economic-mathematical (to compare and analyze data), institutional-comparative (for the analysis Mundell-Fleming model application in the digital economy). The paper studies the Mundell-Fleming model application in digital economy, it investigates global trends as well as peculiarities of digitalization in Ukrainian economy. We believe digitalization is the instrument to solve the Mundell-Fleming trilemma.

In this research paper, the author intended to define and examine the relationship and impact of construction productivity (CP) over construction project performance (CPP). The author tests the proposition that there is a positive relationship/impact between both of them. And to test the effect of factors is affecting CP on CPP and to propose a conceptual model on the basis of the analysis. To validate the mathematical validity of factor analysis, Spearman correlation analysis has been performed on the factors. And to check the reliability of all the factors using reliability analysis, and finally test the hypothesis that construction productivity is having a positive impact on project performance using one sample t-test. The findings of the study concluded that there is a positive impact of construction productivity on project performance in Indian construction projects. This paper attempts to identify the relationship between CP and CPP and recommends the framework for the industry to grow sustainably and deliver projects successfully.

With Industry 4.0 being unable to address and meet increased drive of personalization, the term Industry 5.0 was coined for addressing personalized manufacturing and empowering humans in manufacturing processes. The onset of the term Industry 5.0 is observed to have various views of how it is defined and what constitutes the reconciliation between humans and machines. This serves as the motivation of this paper in identifying and analyzing the various themes and research trends of what Industry 5.0 is using text mining tools and techniques. Toward this, the abstracts of 196 published papers based on the keyword “Industry 5.0” search in IEEE, science direct and MDPI data bases were extracted. Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed for further analysis to apply text mining techniques of key terms extraction and frequency analysis. Further topic mining i.e., unsupervised machine learning method was used for exploring the data. It is observed that the terms artificial intelligence (AI), big data, supply chain, digital transformation, machine learning, internet of things (IoT), are among the most often used and among several enablers that have been identified by researchers to drive Industry 5.0. Five major themes of Industry 5.0 addressing, supply chain evaluation and optimization, enterprise innovation and digitization, smart and sustainable manufacturing, transformation driven by IoT, AI, and Big Data, and Human-machine connectivity were classified among the published literature, highlighting the research themes that can be further explored. It is observed that the theme of Industry 5.0 as a gateway towards human machine connectivity and co-existence is gaining more interest among the research community in the recent years.</jats:p>",5,1,27,27,Big data; Digitization; Industry 4.0; Automation; Computer science; Data science; Identification (biology); Personalization; Digital transformation; Supply chain; Manufacturing; Industrial Revolution; Data pre-processing; Artificial intelligence; Knowledge management,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/asi5010027,,10.3390/asi5010027,,,0,007-805-294-452-363; 014-701-830-171-774; 014-934-290-898-725; 017-415-713-662-955; 018-320-239-571-451; 024-494-460-611-587; 027-188-932-616-882; 027-519-650-344-683; 028-449-924-497-640; 029-087-799-772-164; 033-965-786-944-095; 039-236-353-346-581; 039-547-585-466-302; 042-903-381-502-080; 044-628-273-462-359; 044-998-373-851-683; 045-021-026-328-000; 046-819-137-590-094; 047-486-990-455-440; 048-092-008-205-493; 049-534-371-095-200; 049-816-999-056-296; 050-940-763-389-186; 057-110-051-295-255; 057-727-174-826-765; 058-724-297-819-998; 059-651-423-638-701; 067-215-875-080-779; 069-133-957-040-416; 070-609-833-244-587; 073-449-782-412-059; 075-188-830-741-966; 075-662-363-625-645; 076-991-386-599-906; 080-444-539-645-101; 083-256-551-682-432; 084-067-257-212-804; 085-056-587-927-434; 094-019-830-401-584; 101-407-888-546-440; 106-219-551-506-80X; 113-890-075-887-027; 117-455-364-766-44X; 124-064-639-371-099; 131-968-199-726-102; 132-974-802-685-77X; 138-332-915-687-580; 146-536-286-495-045; 153-560-894-890-798; 154-882-045-080-430; 162-124-681-890-431; 170-988-797-789-464; 175-919-077-874-030; 181-601-884-521-300; 198-555-263-184-447,10,true,cc-by,gold

Japan's Society 5.0 needs to be discussed because the global aspect of Japan's Society 5.0, namely the spread via the internet and Google, has not been researched widely. Even though, the Government of Japan committed as a role model for the world with Society 5.0 . The method used in this article is a case study with data from Google Trends. The concept used is the globalization from Thomas Friedman. The results of this article show that the topic of Japan's Society 5.0 has attracted foreign public attention in several countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, India, and the United States. Then, the public in these countries also used Google to find out topics related to Japan's Society 5.0. For example, the topics of society, industry, the industrial revolution, and Industry 4.0. The spread of Japan's Society 5.0 topic in various countries can be stated in line with Thomas Friedman's argumentation on globalization which is centered on Information and Communications Technology (ICT) development. Artikel ini berupaya untuk mendeskripsikan penyebaran topik Society 5.0 Jepang di luar Jepang berdasarkan hasil pencarian Google pada tahun 2019. Society 5.0 Jepang perlu untuk dibahas karena aspek global dari Society 5.0 Jepang yaitu penyebaran melalui internet dan Google belum terlalu dikaji secara luas. Padahal, Pemerintah Jepang memiliki komitmen untuk menjadi percontohan bagi dunia dengan Society 5.0 . Metode yang digunakan dalam artikel ini adalah studi kasus dengan data dari Google Trends. Konsep yang digunakan adalah globalisasi dari Thomas Friedman. Hasil artikel ini memperlihatkan topik Society 5.0 Jepang menjadi perhatian publik asing di beberapa negara seperti Indonesia, Malaysia, India, dan Amerika Serikat. Lalu, publik di negara-negara tersebut juga menggunakan Google untuk mencari tahu topik yang terkait dengan Society 5.0 Jepang. Contohnya adalah topik masyarakat, industri, revolusi industri, dan Industry 4.0 . Penyebaran topik Society 5.0 Jepang di berbagai negara dapat dinyatakan sejalan dengan argumentasi globalisasi dari Thomas Friedman yang berpusat pada perkembangan Teknologi Informasi dan Komunikasi (TIK).",9,1,61,82,,,,,,http://ajis.fisip.unand.ac.id/index.php/ajis/article/download/307/139 http://ajis.fisip.unand.ac.id/index.php/ajis/article/view/307 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/327261186.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.25077/ajis.9.1.61-82.2020,,10.25077/ajis.9.1.61-82.2020,3047295660,,0,,0,true,cc-by-nc-sa,gold

Sierik,"<jats:p>The article examines the foundations of educational innovations in the Krestovozdvszhensk Labor Brotherhood, which was founded by the famous philosopher, landowner and philanthropist N. N. Neplyuev in the 1880s, 30 km to North of Glukhov. It shows the socio-economic successes that the community could achieve in the production and social spheres. Educational innovations, due to which young brothers were brought up, are characterized: the need for constant practical application of innovative technologies and methods of work, reproduction of motives for self-learning and obtaining new knowledge, conditionality of constant decision-making, self-organization and self-government, etc. Methods of organization, social relations, approach to production activities along which the Brotherhood lived, days with the present. In particular, the focus of the Brotherhood's economy on the use of renewable resources and ensuring the sustainable state of adjacent ecosystems brings it closer to the goals and objectives of the Third Industrial Revolution, which is now taking place in the world. The priority of information production in the Brotherhood and its focus on the mechanization of labor processes make it clearer the logics of the modern Fourth Industrial Revolution clearer. And, finally, the invaluable achievement of the brothers is the priority they have achieved of a human personality development. This is what is now becoming essential in the light of the Fifth Industrial Revolution. It is especially noted that the Brotherhood, thanks to its educational system, managed to create a unique reproductive potential, which included: a system of necessary self-reproduction of human personalities; system of reproduction of the most effective use and reproduction of natural capital; system of reproduction of synergetic combination of human, natural and physical capitals.</jats:p>",,3,98,116,Political science; Economic growth,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.21272/mer.2020.89.08,http://dx.doi.org/10.21272/mer.2020.89.08,,10.21272/mer.2020.89.08,3134623455,,0,,0,true,,green

Khanova,"The key factors of the development of the transport and logistics industry in the context of the digital transformation of society are highlighted. The definition of a transport and logistics project is given, and its main processes are highlighted (production/delivery of the cargoes to the warehouse/terminal, handling operations with the cargoes, storage of the cargoes, transportation of the cargoes), and additional processes (conversion/reconstruction of the cargoes, flow of funds). The specific features of the transport and logistics process, including many stochastic factors that determine the need for the use of simulation modeling methods, are noted. From the point of view of the theory of organizational systems, the structure of the transport and logistics project management system is proposed. The managed subjects—processes of the transport and logistics project are described in detail and structured. A model of decision-making by managed subjects is constructed. An example of a simulation model of a transport and logistics project for the delivery of equipment for a wind power plant is considered. The description of the submodels of the simulation model is given in accordance with the developed generalized management structure of the transport and logistics process. Experiments were carried out, optimal production intensities were identified for a transport and logistics project for the delivery of equipment for a wind power plant.KeywordsTransport and logistics projectManagementSimulation modelingExperiments",,,301,313,Context (archaeology); Integrated logistics support; Process (computing); Traffic management; Logistics management; Process management; Transport engineering; Systems engineering; Operations research,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-95112-2_25,,10.1007/978-3-030-95112-2_25,,,0,000-017-524-448-705; 001-517-664-689-970; 001-784-782-687-77X; 022-199-783-341-919; 026-601-261-307-949; 041-437-717-635-476; 047-016-117-791-830; 058-183-437-441-618; 059-871-104-688-984; 061-946-181-641-210; 064-309-940-839-074; 075-066-196-655-079; 084-099-767-037-336; 084-214-657-244-706; 087-779-774-715-033; 109-963-395-691-437; 120-662-621-142-76X,0,false,,

A Review and Meta-analysis,2019-06-30,2019,journal article,International Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management,26854090,Universitas Atma Jaya Yogyakarta,,Yosephine Suharyanti; D.M.R.T. Dewa,"<jats:p>All the theories about market and marketing research, customer relationship management, and business in general, believe that customer satisfaction is one of the main factors for company financial success. However, a survey on 64 studies shows a wide variation of the correlation between customer satisfaction and financial performance. The correlation coefficients are varied from -0.256 to 0.899. This study applies a meta-analysis on those 64 studies’ findings to find the true correlation between customer satisfaction and financial performance. The analysis clusters the 64 studies based on year of research, business category observed, and geographical area of research. The result shows that the correlation between customer satisfaction and financial performance is relatively high (0.525) before 1990, becomes confusing (not-significantly correlated) in 1991-2000, increases (0.626) in 2001-2010, and decreases (0.595) after 2011. Based on business category, the two variables are not significantly correlated both in manufacturing industries and in service industries. The two variables are significantly correlated according to the studies conducted in Europe region (0.566) and Asia-Africa (0.657), but could not to be proven significantly correlated in USA region. The insights from the meta-analysis findings are: (1) the customer satisfaction role is change by time as well as the changes of industry environment, so that research on customer satisfaction will always be beneficial; (2) in individualist society like USA, further researches on customer behavior and culture are required to find more clear explanation about the role of customer satisfaction as well as other financial success factors, on the company performance. </jats:p>",1,1,37,48,Business; Marketing; Customer satisfaction; Lead (geology); Meta-analysis,,,,,http://ojs.uajy.ac.id/index.php/IJIEEM/article/viewFile/2295/1397 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/229551019.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.24002/ijieem.v1i1.2295,,10.24002/ijieem.v1i1.2295,2973255139,,0,,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Martins; Bernardo Firme; Susana M. Vieira; João Figueiredo; João M. C. Sousa,"<jats:p>In the last few decades, there has been a growing necessity for systems that handle market changes and personalized customer needs with near mass production efficiency, defined as the new mass customization paradigm. The Industry 5.0 vision further enhances the human-centricity aspect, in the necessity for manufacturing systems to cooperate with workers, taking advantage of their problem-solving capabilities, creativity, and expertise of the manufacturing process. A solution is to develop a flexible manufacturing system capable of handling different customer requests and real-time decisions from operators. This paper tackles these aspects by proposing a digital twin of a robotic system for solution preparation capable of making real-time scheduling decisions and forecasts using a simulation model while allowing human interventions. A discrete event simulation model was used to forecast possible system improvements. The simulation handles real-time scheduling considering the possibility of adding identical parallel machines. Results show that processing multiple jobs simultaneously with more than one machine on critical processes, increasing the robot speed, and using heuristics that emphasize the shortest transportation time can reduce the overall completion time by 82%.

However, it is crucial to know the factors influencing technological innovation in a green supply chain. Some preconceptions show that technological innovation in a business can be affected by internal and external factors, and therefore there must be correlations between such factors to flourish the technological innovation and, subsequently, the green supply chain. Besides, predicting the technological innovation level in a supply chain can be vital and direct it to the Industry 5.0 goals. In this research, a 3-phased framework will be proposed to predict the Technological Innovation Level of Green Supply Chains. The scope of this research includes Green Investment, Eco-friendly Design and Customer Collaborations. In the 1st phase of the framework, dependent and independent factors considering the scope of the Research will be determined; and then, using statistical data analysis, the weight of factors, which reflects their impact on technological innovation (dependent factor), will be determined. Then, in the 2nd phase, a comprehensive model will be developed and trained. Using the data of supply chains that were gathered in the first phase, the train and test data would be selected. In continuation, the model will be trained and its performance will be evaluated using some metrics. Then, in the last phase (phase 3), the developed model will be used to predict the technological level of supply chains. The outcomes of this research can help top managers of supply chains to predict the level of technological innovation by investing a certain budget in improving the dependent variables. The outcomes demonstrated that Customer Collaboration (0.481), Eco-friendly design (0.419) and Green Investment (0.41) have significant impacts on technological innovation improvement in the studied cases, respectively. Besides, the results showed the superiority of the K-nearest Neighbor algorithm while using the Minkowski distance method and considering 5 neighbors. The findings indicated that the proposed framework could predict Technological Innovation with 0.751 accuracies.

Fomin; Roman Meshcheryakov; Andrey Iskhakov; Yuri Gromov,"This chapter presents an approach to modeling smart city subsystems based on the principle of their cyber-physical integration into a single infrastructure. The uniqueness of the approach is the provision of the smart city topology as a set of cyber-physical clusters that ensure the functioning of the city. Unlike existing solutions, the proposed approach allows to consider the relationship of the information flows between different levels of smart city systems. Considered features of modeling of the cyber-physical water supply system (including active control system models, resource allocation models, scenario modeling) were put into practice by the smart city infrastructure in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The analysis of the functioning of the megalopolis water supply enterprise revealed significant vulnerabilities in ensuring the strategic security of the Leningrad Region, Russia. A basic list of recommendations for reducing the probability of water shortage has been developed based on scenario modeling of disabling of the main water supply source. These results are the basis for creating simulation models of interrupting the main source of smart city water supply and considering issues of improving the efficiency of water supply cyber-physical systems control in the smart city.",,,75,90,Simulation modeling; Risk analysis (engineering); Cyber-physical system; Control (management); Smart city; Resource allocation; Saint petersburg; Computer science; Water scarcity; Water supply,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-63563-3_7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63563-3_7,,10.1007/978-3-030-63563-3_7,3118789882,,0,000-964-367-627-27X; 004-289-210-406-099; 005-990-462-261-828; 006-783-993-101-692; 012-612-892-632-647; 013-505-475-925-572; 014-731-180-040-437; 029-317-563-787-838; 031-113-185-422-010; 102-395-295-360-780; 117-585-003-030-408; 126-388-186-894-439; 133-731-560-527-313,3,false,,

In this respect, the implementation of the circular economy model, which requires engineers to acquire appropriate competencies, enabling companies to establish this model at the manufacturing level. Moreover, competence has always been a priority for both the professional and the company. In this sense, connectivism has been called a learning theory for the digital era; this is the reason why a review of the state-of-the-art developments of this paradigm focused on engineering has been carried out. In this sense, the potential of the digital transformation in instruction to formulate an engineering model based on neuro-competences is of great interest, taking the connectivist paradigm as a methodological axis. To this end, a first bibliometric analysis has been carried out to identify the drivers on which to base the design of the neuro-competencies of the instructional engineering environment and the trend towards curriculum development under dual training models. The bibliographical research carried out on the connectivist paradigm has served to identify the trends followed to date in education within the subject area of engineering. These trends have not fully taken into account the leading role of the human factor within the socio-technical cyber-physical systems of sustainable manufacturing (SCSSM). The focus was more on the technology than on the adaptation of the uniqueness of the human factor and the tasks entrusted to him, which entails an additional complexity that needs to be addressed in both academic and professional contexts. In light of the foregoing, an improvement to the acquisition and management of competencies has been proposed to the academic, professional and dual engineering contexts. It is based on the transversal inclusion of the concept of neuro-competence applied to the competence engineering (CE) model, transforming it into the neuro-competence engineering (NCE) model. The foregoing provides a better match between the characteristics of the human factor and the uniqueness of the tasks performed by the engineer, incorporating activity theory (AT), the law of variety required (LVR), the connectivist paradigm and neuroscience as a transversal driver of innovation through fractality. This proposal enables a ubiquitous and sustainable learning model throughout the entire academic and professional life cycle of the engineer, placing it sustainably at the heart of the instructional and professional cyber-physical socio-technical system, thus complying with the SDGs set by the UN and Horizon 2030.",13,8,4389,,Competence (human resources); Engineering management; Digital transformation; Variety (cybernetics); Sustainable engineering; Computer science; Sustainable development; Adaptation (computer science); Connectivism; Learning theory,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/8/4389 https://idus.us.es/handle/11441/107944 https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/8/4389/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13084389,,10.3390/su13084389,3156997439,,0,000-248-934-782-51X; 000-257-060-937-828; 002-052-422-936-00X; 002-764-082-187-051; 003-190-318-217-736; 007-066-362-009-544; 010-188-454-033-318; 011-560-980-705-529; 011-803-200-068-324; 012-504-862-865-628; 016-281-638-643-238; 016-309-090-086-107; 017-557-569-036-776; 018-643-065-555-350; 019-114-632-117-748; 020-249-263-884-768; 021-013-375-151-716; 021-269-212-641-621; 023-211-964-243-520; 025-288-994-858-057; 027-228-321-743-026; 029-534-629-933-801; 030-447-833-209-52X; 030-997-397-302-643; 032-252-814-985-358; 033-739-242-312-502; 041-064-879-430-933; 042-271-946-455-320; 043-368-123-643-192; 046-934-025-340-190; 051-769-551-477-060; 052-453-807-944-116; 053-526-343-911-279; 053-530-162-809-509; 056-490-188-922-097; 057-021-476-215-834; 057-888-766-237-54X; 058-082-551-642-71X; 058-485-225-720-635; 061-472-007-804-49X; 061-508-236-488-840; 065-103-750-376-489; 065-578-638-556-075; 069-211-190-470-592; 070-176-205-149-166; 070-580-919-519-258; 072-175-378-404-493; 073-227-605-513-031; 074-525-653-012-188; 077-068-317-696-523; 080-599-783-436-156; 089-758-833-541-839; 092-955-685-410-706; 095-834-465-737-393; 098-622-889-694-985; 107-267-433-837-301; 110-309-926-544-567; 113-724-467-093-61X; 116-278-715-717-914; 117-796-521-512-888; 119-730-544-716-817; 119-925-985-130-432; 126-660-588-062-133; 130-123-548-819-526; 136-967-015-884-024; 138-143-336-920-066; 138-529-852-670-835; 139-628-237-366-583; 139-649-663-651-283; 140-017-694-094-643; 145-594-768-943-946; 149-893-976-597-748; 151-067-699-992-99X; 151-658-446-530-089; 152-662-394-943-92X; 164-678-142-538-444; 168-776-736-332-587,3,true,cc-by,gold

INTEGRATION. EDUCATION. Proceedings of the International Scientific Conference,22560629; 16915887,Rezekne Academy of Technologies,,Vilma Sukackė,"Technology acceptance model (TAM) is arguably the most widely used intention theory that explains the individual’s acceptance of a certain technology.  Since Davis introduced TAM in 1986, it has been applied and validated in a variety of disciplines, including educational sciences. However, scholars note that depending on a specific context, the original TAM needs to be extended, which has been done by introducing external variables and other theories. Despite the existent TAM2 and TAM3, numerous scholars still opt for the original TAM, extending it with the variables and theories that are relevant to the specific context of their study. The aim of the present paper is to provide an overview of validated TAM extensions, which might later help to further the understanding of educational technology acceptance, which is a prerequisite of its adoption. Since interdisciplinarity in various contexts is becoming more and more common, the overview presents TAM extensions that come from a number of different disciplines. The overview is based on 108 papers that were retrieved from the Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics) by searching for the keywords ‘extended Technology Acceptance Model’, ‘extended TAM’, and ‘TAM extension’.",5,,525,549,Variety (cybernetics); Educational technology; Technology acceptance model; Context (language use); Computer science; External variable; Knowledge management; Analytics,,,,,http://conferences.rta.lv/index.php/SIE/SIE2019/paper/view/2581 http://journals.ru.lv/index.php/SIE/article/view/3798 http://journals.rta.lv/index.php/SIE/article/download/3798/3991 https://conferences.rta.lv/index.php/SIE/SIE2019/paper/viewPaper/2581 http://journals.rta.lv/index.php/SIE/article/view/3798 http://journals.ru.lv/index.php/SIE/article/download/3798/3991 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/276269870.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17770/sie2019vol5.3798,,10.17770/sie2019vol5.3798,2948659000,,0,000-060-417-634-426; 000-192-241-807-657; 001-896-044-157-028; 002-009-009-314-502; 002-524-455-455-15X; 002-738-315-542-28X; 003-084-551-080-976; 003-461-282-889-670; 004-087-642-395-666; 005-114-489-891-90X; 006-743-551-051-96X; 008-886-823-294-879; 010-345-302-201-833; 011-254-643-589-955; 012-324-673-515-380; 012-713-901-916-696; 012-736-223-459-933; 013-438-143-646-641; 014-337-672-859-478; 014-945-938-187-795; 016-006-036-762-399; 024-931-263-968-838; 027-772-352-481-03X; 029-104-798-516-814; 031-350-654-437-485; 031-446-952-817-490; 031-488-990-263-674; 032-216-176-656-243; 032-946-419-602-253; 033-665-693-191-608; 034-957-011-165-180; 035-738-341-937-370; 038-911-250-952-554; 039-266-603-533-644; 039-719-033-455-961; 041-346-896-921-799; 042-194-475-698-783; 044-244-831-012-940; 044-531-016-882-263; 045-238-259-927-490; 046-011-306-766-328; 046-608-623-604-981; 047-105-400-407-261; 050-158-145-908-92X; 051-121-185-513-380; 051-358-632-280-01X; 055-410-359-369-400; 058-081-424-637-980; 058-201-676-676-656; 058-291-772-009-919; 060-286-799-044-365; 061-259-165-674-448; 061-773-356-664-789; 063-014-737-157-460; 065-195-970-958-916; 065-761-785-191-85X; 067-624-070-521-861; 067-963-675-792-046; 069-629-164-625-835; 070-109-513-692-451; 070-228-166-005-742; 070-892-410-747-445; 071-323-768-093-526; 072-654-117-180-055; 074-985-907-567-667; 075-533-093-091-514; 078-772-545-287-938; 078-835-256-720-171; 080-768-432-037-596; 083-026-769-368-91X; 085-162-169-894-691; 086-754-909-661-136; 093-474-817-290-531; 098-109-450-765-030; 099-287-847-734-118; 105-083-572-143-597; 108-194-471-442-679; 111-967-642-990-937; 112-966-943-064-437; 114-123-671-516-221; 114-556-841-480-844; 116-196-815-757-148; 116-654-675-004-149; 117-817-762-502-656; 118-103-312-124-303; 119-401-692-120-989; 122-589-788-943-520; 122-781-429-944-652; 135-167-153-922-058; 143-875-130-007-110; 144-449-085-891-625; 144-490-339-181-872; 151-720-506-951-323; 156-878-325-309-19X; 159-374-486-295-921; 160-963-018-696-67X; 163-637-734-144-951; 175-558-529-260-056; 176-351-246-035-770; 184-086-986-348-962; 190-680-485-510-350; 199-489-396-833-723,1,true,,

Industry 4.0 offers a range of opportunities for companies to increase the flexibility and efficiency of production processes. The development of new business models can be promoted with digital platforms and architectures for Industry 4.0. Therefore, products from the healthcare sector can increase in value. The adaptive integrated digital architecture framework (AIDAF) for Industry 4.0 is expected to promote and implement the digital platforms and robotics for healthcare and medical communities efficiently. In this paper, we propose that various digital platforms and robotics are designed and evaluated for digital healthcare as for manufacturing industry with Industry 4.0. We argue that the design of an open healthcare platform “Open Healthcare Platform 2030 - OHP2030” for medical product design and robotics can be developed with AIDAF. The vision of AIDAF applications to enable Industry 4.0 in the OHP2030 research initiative is explained and referenced, extended in the context of Society 5.0.",,,211,221,Enterprise architecture; Engineering management; Artificial intelligence; Manufacturing; Digital architecture; Industry 4.0; Context (language use); Flexibility (engineering); Robotics; Computer science; Business model,,,,,https://keio.pure.elsevier.com/ja/publications/applying-aidaf-for-enabling-industry-40-in-open-healthcare-platfo https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-3264-8_20,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-3264-8_20,,10.1007/978-981-16-3264-8_20,3166278437,,0,006-465-895-228-186; 007-848-718-741-047; 008-936-401-996-515; 017-627-820-264-746; 018-922-546-578-141; 030-461-029-114-432; 032-001-407-632-030; 035-051-536-561-771; 040-888-328-057-154; 043-619-078-063-298; 043-979-280-803-957; 044-406-763-486-675; 056-330-260-133-031; 060-099-416-733-11X; 068-697-353-290-622; 074-028-000-233-285; 076-090-402-933-022; 093-839-500-433-943; 099-273-614-892-337; 099-347-097-180-014; 105-583-882-171-236; 108-358-496-436-118; 112-463-370-691-913; 127-904-515-083-368; 128-433-358-622-839; 131-862-870-984-170; 142-693-927-846-524; 157-380-063-578-733; 170-563-722-411-658; 182-472-250-335-934; 184-042-371-378-300,0,false,,

At the same time, production and processes must become more flexible, and humans have to adapt to new products more often and even faster. Industry 5.0 will increasingly focus on human-centric approaches, on the collaboration of humans and machines intensively using cognitive assistance systems. The design of an innovative cognitive assistance system is a complex task due to the many technological opportunities and their interrelationships. In the framework of this research, a method was developed enabling the systematic design of cognitive assistance systems that integrates business and worker requirements aiming at improving productivity, quality, worker satisfaction and well-being. The research question was approached by design science research having, as the main output, a systematic and innovative method for the design of cognitive assistance systems based on quality function deployment (QFD), referred to as cognitive assistance system-QFD (CAS-QFD). The developed methodology is divided into six phases and includes the iterative design of a cognitive assistance system starting from the assembly process. The method considers the information needs of the workers, the definition of the appropriate assistance functions and the selection of the interaction technologies. The exemplarily industrial evaluation highlighted the relevance of CAS-QFD for systematically designing cognitive assistance systems based on holistic requirements, identified at the worker, workplace, production area and, finally, at the enterprise level.</jats:p>",12,8,3887,3887,Quality function deployment; Computer science; Cognition; Process management; Knowledge management; Quality (philosophy); Function (biology); Product (mathematics); Software deployment; New product development; Engineering; Risk analysis (engineering),,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app12083887,,10.3390/app12083887,,,0,000-069-943-339-065; 000-872-737-954-983; 001-351-732-679-356; 001-369-603-792-163; 002-432-260-051-325; 003-304-795-752-398; 003-402-941-003-045; 003-980-176-434-087; 004-725-793-952-304; 004-849-244-126-557; 004-894-291-973-153; 006-503-299-476-612; 007-231-299-750-554; 008-479-689-591-531; 008-837-372-853-983; 010-948-310-625-743; 011-815-973-316-025; 012-437-209-240-935; 014-095-246-794-414; 014-224-044-628-176; 014-409-325-602-395; 017-415-713-662-955; 017-459-070-179-170; 018-109-334-369-944; 019-248-560-687-277; 021-605-309-335-356; 021-882-778-999-476; 022-790-621-879-431; 023-831-765-465-494; 024-953-859-303-113; 025-942-041-625-709; 028-005-753-183-913; 029-515-808-095-205; 033-541-372-628-755; 037-277-785-325-862; 037-508-704-688-473; 038-287-375-579-320; 038-964-429-089-518; 044-401-516-642-156; 047-885-778-073-419; 047-913-991-153-149; 049-583-824-023-48X; 051-661-268-905-301; 059-514-085-671-822; 059-985-451-979-992; 062-806-191-230-329; 063-640-226-807-415; 063-944-254-756-689; 065-663-107-957-263; 067-275-171-224-003; 068-269-681-965-966; 070-246-603-420-514; 073-932-262-960-174; 074-305-604-659-474; 076-243-578-348-104; 077-581-622-629-076; 084-249-962-919-116; 084-290-060-977-207; 085-033-284-767-478; 086-366-755-495-395; 086-420-480-368-083; 087-157-957-268-743; 088-878-503-413-754; 101-524-432-756-450; 102-679-146-041-844; 103-463-172-499-414; 104-580-494-317-758; 106-503-170-178-863; 108-512-420-405-246; 109-568-141-046-083; 110-510-842-185-282; 118-401-703-686-43X; 122-209-874-729-144; 123-878-469-773-680; 127-876-680-459-642; 137-761-456-237-909; 138-232-752-906-225; 138-529-852-670-835; 141-565-165-447-275; 143-614-890-730-998; 148-940-277-668-378; 150-451-296-261-738; 152-235-455-044-105; 153-500-855-102-299; 159-631-748-884-043; 159-850-409-679-715; 165-669-901-223-630; 165-743-992-734-50X; 173-929-862-162-764; 187-357-390-633-368,1,true,cc-by,gold

This is based upon the unique and inherent characteristics such as thermal Shape Memory Effect (SME) and Superelasticity (or Pseudoelasticity). While thermal SME is used for shape morphing applications wherein temperature change can govern the shape and dimension of the SMA, Superelasticity allows the alloy to withstand a comparatively very high magnitude of loads without undergoing plastic deformation at higher temperatures. These unique properties in wearables have revolutionized the field, and from fabrics to exoskeletons, SMA has found its place in robotics and cobotics. This review article focuses on the most recent research work in the field of SMA-based smart wearables paired with robotic applications for human-robot interaction. The literature is categorized based on SMA property incorporated and on actuator or sensor-based concept. Further, use-cases or conceptual frameworks for SMA fiber in fabric for '<i>Smart Jacket</i>' and SMA springs in the shoe soles for '<i>Smart Shoes</i>' are proposed. The conceptual frameworks are built upon existing technologies; however, their utility in a smart factory concept is emphasized, and algorithms to achieve the same are proposed. The integration of the two concepts with the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is discussed, specifically regarding minimizing hazards for the worker/user in Industry 5.0. The article aims to propel a discussion regarding the multi-faceted applications of SMAs in human-robot interaction and Industry 5.0. Furthermore, the challenges and the limitations of the smart alloy and the technological barriers restricting the growth of SMA applications in the field of smart wearables are observed and elaborated.",22,18,6802,,,hand exoskeletons; human-computer interaction; human-robot interaction; shape memory alloys; smart wearables,Alloys/chemistry; Humans; Plastics; Robotics; Shape Memory Alloys; Wearable Electronic Devices,Alloys; Plastics; Shape Memory Alloys,Marie Skłodowska-Curie Grant (847577); Science Foundation Ireland (SFI/16/RC/3918) Ireland,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22186802,36146151,10.3390/s22186802,,PMC9504003,0,000-226-691-604-243; 000-521-781-765-982; 001-584-148-450-891; 003-600-025-200-120; 004-943-370-211-753; 005-057-489-503-585; 005-285-077-422-791; 005-886-854-585-784; 006-336-213-400-372; 007-870-955-321-792; 008-172-525-504-271; 008-195-709-059-856; 008-638-480-762-243; 010-054-941-179-556; 011-014-452-167-589; 012-410-778-505-681; 012-415-050-172-741; 013-813-706-155-232; 013-966-089-008-276; 014-339-799-747-368; 014-720-800-604-501; 014-748-033-428-985; 015-615-475-590-872; 016-395-615-642-596; 017-947-125-888-795; 018-686-104-815-005; 018-814-244-214-07X; 019-868-289-770-539; 020-404-020-173-061; 021-023-252-281-069; 022-974-916-457-419; 023-536-405-370-756; 023-741-548-473-421; 024-264-717-440-792; 025-863-646-316-727; 027-208-289-087-226; 027-346-932-178-502; 027-453-006-156-615; 027-879-026-756-800; 028-021-066-976-401; 028-365-277-677-398; 030-491-977-338-37X; 032-091-295-964-293; 032-156-853-579-221; 032-180-047-656-915; 032-473-807-830-584; 033-065-159-215-72X; 036-123-267-743-425; 036-478-895-374-280; 039-748-145-568-074; 040-297-440-369-209; 041-641-068-721-048; 043-772-242-542-33X; 044-128-235-947-741; 044-901-290-671-771; 045-660-169-220-807; 045-768-446-785-289; 046-124-494-743-30X; 047-180-155-930-285; 049-090-795-106-220; 049-900-129-158-485; 050-177-656-685-450; 050-265-278-831-464; 051-082-248-599-195; 051-313-821-382-593; 051-704-977-259-987; 052-145-370-769-68X; 052-774-150-404-912; 056-531-141-708-294; 057-283-417-029-302; 057-460-444-096-476; 065-719-630-034-113; 065-738-946-883-406; 066-412-381-168-195; 066-659-622-094-612; 067-050-352-211-757; 069-643-505-668-886; 072-013-068-460-287; 073-578-666-076-845; 074-156-253-557-743; 074-207-772-471-885; 074-531-630-428-843; 077-510-493-185-131; 078-382-956-438-557; 078-608-278-944-467; 080-075-776-982-477; 080-470-785-134-795; 084-519-589-350-706; 088-659-155-828-282; 092-444-107-456-513; 096-666-849-829-269; 096-887-597-203-233; 097-976-496-373-680; 098-230-875-334-898; 099-663-200-524-052; 101-959-261-349-895; 103-156-959-244-706; 107-857-171-819-225; 113-500-559-054-738; 118-555-997-256-700; 124-649-308-016-512; 132-853-732-850-272; 134-125-406-432-347; 137-519-888-164-867; 138-636-399-206-80X; 139-837-136-852-962; 139-939-116-336-773; 144-428-027-407-708; 150-536-333-645-70X; 167-607-314-205-955; 169-488-842-897-848; 187-697-446-859-19X,0,true,cc-by,gold

The technological era in the industrial era 4.0 supports these changes. However, this era caused panic among people who thought that this era caused a lot of use of technology to achieve prosperity and a lack of use of human resources. The era of society 5.0 is different from that era where technology is considered not the main factor, but human resources as the main factor supporting prosperity, technology plays a role as a supporter. This research is conducted in Islamic boarding schools in East Java, where the pesantren is a unique part of society. This study aims to describe the role of Social Bounding, Social Bridging and Social Linking in Islamic boarding schools and to find out how this can increase the Value Economy of students as part of society in facing the era of society 5.0. By using a qualitative research method descriptive study, it can be seen that social bounding has different characteristics from what Woolcock suggests, namely by planting values, culture, perceptions and traditions from religious sources, state law, and instilling the Pancasila ideology. Social bridging does not have a significant difference, namely by improving community weaknesses and maximizing potential. Likewise social linking with the use of networks to help achieve goals. Meanwhile, in relation to creating a value economy in the future, skills training through extra activities are needed.

Today the need of expansion in businesses directly leads to adoption of new concepts of manufacturing and also making awareness of those used processes to ultimate consumers is needed. Industry 4.0 is related to the processes with latest technologies such as clean-green energy, automation, internet of things (IoT) and digitization, whereas, green manufacturing is almost similar like use of fewer natural resources, reduction in pollution &amp; waste, reducing carbon footprints, recycle &amp; reuse of material and moderate emission in processes. Country’s sustainable growth right now is major among other strategies and every country is trying and working hard to incorporate the development process through adoption of these types of tools &amp; techniques. Industry 4.0 technologies and green manufacturing relate to “Green Dialogue” and to some extent proving the object also. Now, introduction of Industry 5.0 is welcoming fully fledged automation of industries with green processes like G-IoT. However, climate health, consumers health and production &amp; operation health is on priority to have healthier green clean sustainable development in the world. From the above title, the purpose of this study is to present the potential of the industries; under new industrial revolution with the combination to eco-friendly manufacturing leading to knowledge of the updated technologies used for their respective ecological production &amp; operation management. These concepts are considered to be new around the world and most of the developed countries are more active in accepting these; sustainable concepts in their operations and production in industries. Developing countries like India are way behind in acquiring these concepts as manufacturing is aware but not willing to pay extra cost of production in advancing the operation &amp; production process. Most of the top manufacturers of India have already started using this sustainable process as they have to prove their responsibility towards society at large by Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) also.</jats:p>",17,1,,,Digitization; Business; Manufacturing; Sustainable development; Production (economics); Automation; Manufacturing engineering; Engineering; Industrial organization,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.51220/jmr.v17i1.9,,10.51220/jmr.v17i1.9,,,0,,0,false,,

This development entails that job transformations and future skills need attention from the perspective of industry 5.0, where human and machine find ways of working together to improve production performance. Facing this perspective, one challenge is a growing need for novel lifelong learning initiatives, to meet emerging and altering occupations for the fulfilment of future skill requirements. This challenge is addressed here by portraying a case where three Swedish universities have formed a distinctive collaboration to develop a flexible (i.e. blended) course for professionals, in the subject of Digitally-enabled production. The purpose is to develop a sustainable collaboration between the universities and create a course format on master level addressing lifelong learning for the increasingly digitalized production. The ambition is to increase the impact of the universities respective efforts by sharing resources and utilizing individual specialized expertise to develop a practical and relevant course that can reach a larger target group. The course encompasses industry 4.0 readiness on three levels of production systems; plant-, production cell-, and component level; to adopt a holistic view of digitalization in production. We followed an action research approach for continuously collecting and documenting our experiences during the course development, implementation, and dissemination of the course. Within the frame of action research, an explorative case study describes and analyzes the initiative. The results highlight challenges and opportunities for succeeding with this form of co-produced course. The joint course gives professionals possibilities to work on cases from their own companies with expert supervision from three manufacturing levels to address complex challenges in industry 4.0 implementation. To conclude, the importance of lifelong learning in relation to the human-centric approach of industry 5.0 is emphasized as a future direction.</jats:p>",,,,,Lifelong learning; Production (economics); Knowledge management; Engineering; Perspective (graphical); Action (physics); Engineering ethics; Business; Engineering management,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/atde220184,,10.3233/atde220184,,,0,,0,true,,gold

It has seen a rapid increase in the elderly population and a decrease in the birth rate. This caused Japan to be a hyper-ageing society. Japanese’s first Baby-boomers who were born in 1947-1949 are now entering old age. Elderly care is a major problem in Japan. Children and care-workers for elderly parents are scarce. Therefore, the second Baby-boomers (born in 1971-1974) aged 40-50 years old have quit working to care for their elderly parents. This situation is known as ‘kaigo rishoku.’ This study looked into the practice of elderly care in Japanese 5.0 Society. Society 5.0 is a concept developed by Japan. It is human-centred and technology-based. In society 5.0, robots and the internet play an essential role in human life. Therefore, we proposed a critical question: Can robots replace humans to care for the elderly in Society 5.0? This study used the qualitative method with a phenomenological approach and descriptive analysis. The results revealed that although robots can assist elderly care, due to the high cost, only a certain elderly can buy them. Therefore, in order for robots to become caregivers of the future, mass production is needed. Thus, robots can be marketed at relatively lower prices. However, sick elderly who live alone still need human assistance. On the one hand, technology helps human life in Society 5.0. On the other hand, the human touch is still necessary for elderly care.",4,2,435,452,Psychology; Elderly parents; Ageing society; Critical question; Elderly care; Human life; Elderly population; Birth rate; Descriptive statistics; Gerontology,,,,,https://ejournal.unitomo.ac.id/index.php/jsk/article/download/2448/1166 https://ejournal.unitomo.ac.id/index.php/jsk/article/view/2448,http://dx.doi.org/10.25139/jsk.v4i2.2448,,10.25139/jsk.v4i2.2448,3040585712,,0,,3,true,cc-by-sa,gold

Roy,"Service growth in manufacturing firms is in active research in the domain of servitization and open to various new conceptualizations. Servitization is reinventing the business model solely from manufacturer to service provider. The concept is practiced in industries to sell their product with outcome as a service. Various manufacturers are adding service as an integral component with product rather than simply after-sales services. Industries such as photocopier and farm equipment industries, engine manufacturers, and many more, including software service providers, are practicing servitization. Manufacturers get various benefits of the servitization as a business model. By offering advanced services, they qualify for better competition, and few benefits include enhanced revenue, improved customer requirements, better innovative products, loyal customer base, and creating high entry barrier to competitors. The potential to achieve such benefits is causing a growing number of manufacturers to explore the servitization as a good business model, and especially advanced services. However, precisely how to deliver advanced services is a challenge for many companies. Customer requirements are increasingly getting complex everyday. High-tech equipment, customers’ trust on it and dealers who provide these equipment and their services are increasing more than ever. Manufacturers, instead of focusing solely on selling a product, are revamping their approach to match the increasing desires of their customers. This chapter summarizes an inquiry into earlier work done in servitization and the future scope of work. The way firms are now shifting to service domain has demonstrated their trust and proved its impact on profitability. The use of innovative Internet of things (IoT) and data mining softwares, and its amalgamation with manufacturing equipment and customers’ expectations force manufacturers to adopt newer methodologies and serve better.",,,289,303,Business; Service (business); Revenue; Product (mathematics); Competitor analysis; Marketing; Business model; Profitability index; Service provider; Work (physics); Competition (biology),,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9781003158165-15,,10.1201/9781003158165-15,,,0,,0,false,,

In this context, which is characterized by a large gap between training and operative processes, a dedicated method is required to manage and extract the massive amount of data and the related information mining. The method presented in this work aims to reduce this gap with near-zero-failure advanced diagnostics (AD) for smart management, which is exploitable in any context of Society 5.0, thus reducing the risk factors at all management levels and ensuring quality and sustainability. We have also developed innovative applications for a human-centered management system to support scheduling in the maintenance of operative processes, for reducing training costs, for improving production yield, and for creating a human–machine cyberspace for smart infrastructure design. The results obtained in 12 international companies demonstrate a possible global standardization of operative processes, leading to the design of a near-zero-failure intelligent system that is able to learn and upgrade itself. Our new method provides guidance for selecting the new generation of intelligent manufacturing and smart systems in order to optimize human–machine interactions, with the related smart maintenance and education.",6,7,835,846,Scheduling (computing); Artificial intelligence; Smart system; Standardization; Management system; Quality (business); Context (language use); Cyberspace; Computer science; Big data,,,,Grant 2017; Cariparma Foundation; Department of Medicine and Surgery; CSEIA,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095809920300266 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2095809920300266 https://doaj.org/article/3f55db5b87c9467da9dd400862a40b76 https://air.unipr.it/handle/11381/2872548,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eng.2019.11.014,,10.1016/j.eng.2019.11.014,3003162042,,0,000-695-624-225-501; 001-323-429-375-458; 001-462-248-576-023; 003-821-070-459-763; 007-863-302-831-562; 009-925-932-430-898; 012-373-473-281-736; 013-308-381-667-776; 015-179-947-788-927; 020-680-911-838-355; 022-380-596-265-048; 022-883-462-323-85X; 024-301-292-916-563; 024-533-356-605-434; 024-686-978-205-387; 025-508-842-268-05X; 028-232-581-949-707; 029-088-494-457-336; 029-522-085-058-640; 029-761-682-813-729; 030-139-354-389-282; 031-506-949-907-374; 032-055-105-686-264; 033-463-729-344-544; 036-048-873-809-458; 043-866-693-114-286; 045-936-475-493-242; 048-827-579-519-108; 050-803-018-211-918; 051-118-827-089-028; 051-969-387-725-363; 052-227-014-472-221; 054-971-734-581-504; 057-034-975-930-616; 063-483-909-050-195; 071-473-279-124-057; 074-482-942-286-276; 078-505-826-257-819; 079-796-431-947-902; 080-900-769-184-108; 082-444-578-495-751; 084-640-871-954-292; 085-710-989-349-829; 088-286-897-179-745; 095-657-169-699-869; 097-115-411-543-915; 098-276-959-684-741; 098-621-664-553-79X; 100-124-216-391-558; 106-971-451-537-030; 113-688-605-343-205; 113-844-783-102-633; 118-370-935-746-471; 129-718-596-982-317; 137-321-353-227-821; 140-478-325-778-398; 141-520-178-697-83X; 146-119-252-820-906; 156-099-468-912-647; 165-778-127-427-88X; 168-757-667-266-956; 170-343-790-752-628; 174-539-731-574-243; 175-785-932-198-352,51,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

Romanova; Dmitry V. Sirotin,"<jats:p>Industrialisation remains the major factor of development in the era of radical changes. Its drivers – advanced digital production technologies – are transforming the entire industrial and spatial landscape. Industrial regions take a special role in these transformations. The research aims to identify trends in the development of basic industries in industrial regions and work out a method to form their new technological image. Methodologically, the study relies on the institutional theory, theories of sustainable and longterm technical and economic development; applies methods of comparative, statistical, structural analysis and neural network modelling. Considering the case of the Ural metal industries, the study reveals the main trends of development and possibilities of forming the image of future of the basic industries of Russia’s industrial regions, as well as specifies the factors that modify these trends under the New Normal. Due to institutional and technological transformations, the Russian metal industries have achieved impregnable positions in the world market. The paper substantiates the changes in the development of the basic industries linked with the formation of Industry 5.0 as the new management paradigm, which assigns priority to the ESG factors. The research demonstrates that an indispensable condition for the successful functioning of companies is the ability to cooperate and agree on decisions. The findings confirm that modernised metal and other basic industries through integrating green, digital and behavioural economy will not only maintain, but are likely to increase their importance in the economy of industrial regions.</jats:p>",23,2,9,28,Industrialisation; Industrial organization; Business; Sustainable development; Economic system; Regional science; Computer science; Economic geography,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.29141/2658-5081-2022-23-2-1,,10.29141/2658-5081-2022-23-2-1,,,0,003-682-809-618-463; 019-218-091-890-573; 020-191-419-063-87X; 028-638-803-907-298; 032-789-188-529-821; 035-253-870-973-574; 042-293-327-072-344; 049-630-935-658-823; 052-162-157-249-567; 053-211-367-558-338; 060-295-480-322-014; 063-891-616-996-756; 069-166-891-026-427; 071-596-620-879-761; 079-284-096-761-588; 082-550-423-767-715; 089-975-648-983-935; 095-589-362-164-725; 101-402-844-565-479; 121-580-763-708-56X; 130-447-246-822-317; 174-934-407-787-976; 186-735-012-000-298,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Unlike Industry 4.0, Industry 5.0 continues to rely on the role of human beings, and is human-centered in its use, so that the role of human beings is not degraded or replaced. The role of humans in Industry 5.0, in addition to having a positive impact, also has the potential of leading to negative impacts, which are now widely found in the circulation of hoaxes, online persecution (doxing), and also online radicalization, which are spread using the Internet. The sources of the data in this study are the results of in-depth interviews with social observers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and Indonesia Tanpa Pacaran members as primary data sources. The findings of this study reinforce the notion that Indonesia Tanpa Pacaran is a highly exclusionary movement. This movement is hostile to people outside their groups on the basis of differences in identity and extreme understanding of Islamic values. Besides, this movement is also found to be radical, because it encourages marriage by ignoring the process of becoming acquainted, and the social dynamics between individuals. Another finding is that this movement also has the potential to encourage social conflict in a pluralistic Indonesian society.",,,,,Human resources; Social relation; Political economy; Political science; Radicalization; Identity (social science); Islam; Social media; Social dynamics; Social conflict,,,,,https://eprints.eudl.eu/id/eprint/1474/ https://eudl.eu/doi/10.4108/eai.16-10-2019.2304332,http://dx.doi.org/10.4108/eai.16-10-2019.2304332,,10.4108/eai.16-10-2019.2304332,3127474042,,0,018-475-627-014-282; 020-888-200-021-317; 034-582-624-437-371; 090-246-245-041-551; 126-814-702-779-875; 134-197-876-576-903; 181-112-366-667-53X; 183-292-079-839-750,0,true,,bronze

Based on the concepts of Industry 4.0, several variations emerged, such as Logistics 4.0, Health 4.0, and Agriculture 4.0. However, it was in Japan that the idea Society 5.0 emerged, which promises the application of all aspects of the fourth revolution and its consequences in a fully autonomous society.

This has resulted in University Technology Transfer (UTT) taking place within an increasingly complex network of regional stakeholders. This complexity has resulted in quadruple helix models where the triple helix model of academia, industry and regional government now includes societal based innovation users as a fourth helix. Despite this development, extant research is fragmented and lacks coherent frameworks and conceptualisations which fully depict the dynamic and evolving nature of UTT. Accordingly, this article reviews Mode 2 UTT from a quadruple helix perspective to identify key themes to develop a research agenda which reflects progression from a triple into a quadruple helix ecosystem.",48,1,7,24,Triple helix; Government; Political science; Management; Systematic review; Perspective (graphical); Technology transfer; Quadruple helix; Mode 2; Knowledge management; End user,,,,,https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/en/publications/a-systematic-literature-review-of-university-technology-transfer--3 http://doras.dcu.ie/23825/ http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/radm.12228/full https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/en/publications/a-systematic-literature-review-of-university-technology-transfer--4 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/radm.12228 https://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/a-systematic-literature-review-of-university-technology-transfer-from-a-quadruple-helix-perspective-towards-a-research-agenda(8f375051-ac87-4244-99b1-cf75ad4c6cdc)/export.html https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3094117 https://core.ac.uk/download/74405052.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/radm.12228,,10.1111/radm.12228,2512358365,,0,001-218-752-217-738; 001-588-065-749-626; 001-793-961-245-947; 002-529-702-064-475; 002-910-853-396-103; 003-464-864-294-558; 003-995-845-479-955; 006-360-473-535-628; 006-407-325-662-153; 006-810-486-549-434; 008-568-541-949-263; 012-074-095-978-447; 012-191-011-422-306; 013-159-485-219-154; 015-276-436-539-843; 015-845-606-711-827; 018-918-549-280-170; 021-802-181-302-59X; 024-072-021-338-769; 026-635-844-256-165; 027-133-011-502-196; 033-727-858-183-392; 036-274-626-792-383; 036-285-006-299-516; 037-577-649-602-890; 038-040-571-925-521; 043-459-391-987-50X; 043-859-587-533-166; 049-514-992-846-857; 049-583-324-306-942; 050-140-511-135-504; 050-314-118-587-261; 051-620-137-104-909; 052-553-276-350-498; 057-553-555-783-394; 058-187-279-002-027; 059-274-407-495-754; 064-522-769-390-715; 064-770-023-631-28X; 067-606-758-808-693; 068-627-604-031-34X; 068-836-749-402-210; 069-878-836-875-085; 070-186-869-942-369; 071-887-324-635-770; 072-270-188-920-150; 072-582-540-989-660; 072-745-335-055-90X; 072-825-764-455-047; 073-429-587-876-650; 073-838-075-391-85X; 073-868-973-630-207; 075-639-472-070-33X; 078-421-247-919-795; 078-565-590-541-227; 078-757-494-993-625; 079-384-320-708-764; 082-777-532-476-710; 084-662-890-688-775; 085-106-818-998-84X; 085-300-287-100-525; 086-387-291-703-856; 086-870-852-943-690; 090-479-393-475-623; 094-407-405-677-779; 094-913-369-084-870; 095-634-123-121-592; 096-252-584-668-622; 099-205-315-606-05X; 101-224-404-255-478; 103-943-565-803-379; 104-980-736-274-934; 105-104-311-320-807; 110-545-874-743-074; 111-168-723-616-073; 111-764-490-617-841; 113-242-639-307-214; 115-222-439-208-97X; 116-245-043-687-968; 116-820-086-399-710; 117-122-284-038-527; 120-094-718-338-889; 130-177-967-697-870; 130-225-855-797-90X; 131-338-814-630-502; 136-751-658-577-439; 141-946-119-347-563; 149-399-321-037-885; 150-174-905-824-952; 150-967-971-620-456; 155-431-528-320-746; 156-400-087-782-834; 160-606-043-902-329; 161-985-030-766-38X; 166-429-203-555-332; 168-347-621-793-775; 176-554-029-089-73X; 181-239-695-220-77X,161,true,,green

In spite of innovating upon the base technology to build processes for a better industrial future, there are some problems which do not have a clear-cut solution and this is where Fuzzy mathematical modeling comes into play.;  Moreover, with talks of Industry 5.0 surfacing, which is considered as the age of robots, a robot is given clear cut instructions as to a manufacturing process even in an uncertain environment.

Moylan,"This article presents an idea of achieving reliability through Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for industrial power systems. It proposes hybrid approach for predictive and corrective maintenance. It discusses the self-corrective maintenance (SCM) paradigm as hybrid approach for industrial power systems along with condition-based maintenance approach utilizing IIoT to achieve it. As it is well known that industries pay huge penalty for the down time, and suffer to meet reliability demands for years. Study witnesses its cost in millions of dollars yearly for production disruptions. It can be prevented by proactively following the aggressive maintenance schedule. However, it often becomes expensive as part or service may not be utilized for its full life and failure may occur even in middle of maintenance cycle. On the other hand, condition-based maintenance (CBM) helps utilize the full life and prevents the downtime by predicting the failures ahead. This article reviews current maintenance practices followed by industry leaders and a proposal on self-corrective maintenance based on condition of restorable resources. It is about learning the condition of subsystems by itself and taking corrective action when subsystem is not active. This concept helps reduce manual intervention to correct the problem as well as the maintenance cost. This research also covers the self-uncorrectable issues to be handled by proactively following CBM process through IIoT. This hybrid proposal could be a significant gear shift in maintenance direction for general industry as well as power systems. It can be termed as industry's 5th revolution or Industry 5.0.",,,,,Risk analysis (engineering); Corrective maintenance; Downtime; Preventive maintenance; Service (systems architecture); Computer science; Process (engineering); Schedule; Predictive maintenance; Electric power system,,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=8733363 http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/8720818/8733319/08733363.pdf?arnumber=8733363,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icps.2019.8733363,,10.1109/icps.2019.8733363,2951376840,,0,032-172-937-858-527; 066-398-476-399-940; 128-767-415-844-092; 131-885-827-431-871; 174-760-193-722-116,1,false,,

Most factory activities have been transformed through a set of features built into a smart manufacturing framework. The tools brought to bear by the fourth industrial revolution are critical enablers of such change and progress. This review article describes the series of industrial revolutions and explores traditional manufacturing before presenting various enabling technologies. Insights are offered regarding traditional manufacturing lines where some enabling technologies have been included. The manufacturing supply chain is envisaged as enhancing the enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 through their integration. A systematic literature review is undertaken to evaluate each enabling technology and the manufacturing supply chain and to provide some theoretical synthesis. Similarly, obstacles are listed that must be overcome before a complete shift to smart manufacturing is possible. A brief discussion maps out how the fourth industrial revolution has led to novel manufacturing technologies.

The industrial system is shifting from manufacturing worksite superiority to intelligence or software superiority in manufacturing. The government promotes these trends through its Society 5.0 initiative. Software superiority in manufacturing facilitates front loading; the conversion of skills to explicit knowledge makes progress in manufacturing processes through the use of IT and craftsmanship. This research deals with three cases. The first case is a company-developed system that’s scalable from customized products to standard products and that realizes diversified products via microscale production. The second case, focusing on the introduction of robots and a robot system integrator (SIer), is the keystone company within the SIer community; its business consists of robot engineering projects and FA educational system projects. The third case, metal 3D printing manufacturing, is invigorating. The company is the first service bureau in Japan that is capable of providing comprehensive services in the field of metal additive manufacturing (AM), handling everything from powder development and manufacture to prototyping and mass production needs. Clearly, IoT and the servitization of industry are the two wheels of a cart in industry, significantly transforming not only manufacturing sites but also business models. Although each case represents a different field of industry, each meets a unique and remarkable challenge in standardization, platform and ecosystem. In the digital age, IoT is an enabler and provides a background for transformation of business models. Through servitization, businesses can be the field for co-creation by feeding back the experience of learning-by-doing and reorganizing it. It is a powerful option for company to meet the challenge of service platform building.",,,139,151,Manufacturing engineering; Engineering; Business ecosystem; Standardization; Service bureau; Service (systems architecture); Business model; Explicit knowledge; Big data; Robot,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-981-15-0327-6_10,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-0327-6_10,,10.1007/978-981-15-0327-6_10,2992507246,,0,005-590-991-432-327; 021-659-408-664-722; 031-257-287-841-710; 038-161-639-277-315; 052-699-256-660-538; 061-929-854-108-644; 068-845-684-040-670; 078-514-027-813-844; 081-731-396-186-128; 084-960-640-918-211; 085-657-106-088-742; 095-218-964-500-148; 119-256-337-361-325,0,false,,

Despite the constant development of improved communication protocols and standards during Industry 4.0, the latency problem persists, lowering quality of services (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE). Tactile internet (TI), with its high availability, security, and ultra-low latency, will add a new dimension to human-machine interaction (HMI) by enabling haptic and tactile sensations. The tactile internet (TI) is a cutting-edge technology that uses 5G and beyond (B5G) communications to enable real-time interaction of haptic data over the internet between tactile ends. This emerging TI technology is regarded as the next evolutionary step for the Internet of Things (IoT) and is expected to bring about massive changes towards Society 5.0 and to address complex issues in current society. To that end, the 5G mobile communication systems will support the TI at the wireless edge. As a result, TI can be used as a backbone for delay mitigation in conjunction with 5G networks, allowing for ultra-reliable low latency applications like Smart Manufacturing, virtual reality, and augmented reality. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to present the current state of 5G and TI, as well as the challenges and future trends for 5G networks beyond 2021, as well as a conceptual framework for integrating 5G and TI into existing industrial case studies, with a focus on the design aspects and layers of TI, such as the master, network, and slave layers. Finally, the key publications focused on the key enabling technologies of TI are summarized and the beyond 5G era towards Society 5.0 based on cyber-physical systems is discussed.</jats:p>",10,24,3175,3175,Computer science; The Internet; Augmented reality; Quality of experience; Haptic technology; Latency (audio); Quality of service; Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution; Edge device; Low latency (capital markets); Wireless; Computer network,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics10243175,,10.3390/electronics10243175,,,0,000-660-916-724-265; 006-635-585-195-621; 006-950-733-921-577; 007-963-492-785-613; 008-014-504-858-94X; 008-124-206-643-913; 008-297-789-989-208; 008-360-671-751-914; 008-713-674-425-226; 010-082-817-180-371; 013-418-600-612-853; 016-757-504-349-085; 023-253-481-017-057; 026-117-582-871-394; 026-185-700-868-861; 027-451-436-666-923; 027-658-371-426-088; 027-761-099-079-915; 032-854-118-982-346; 033-827-910-920-969; 035-057-839-585-890; 041-714-011-066-008; 046-615-625-086-562; 050-191-209-168-102; 050-278-199-156-328; 052-360-429-319-002; 056-880-337-278-543; 058-020-517-463-749; 059-551-873-028-937; 064-200-373-404-373; 064-705-983-319-33X; 071-391-261-560-636; 075-696-871-989-58X; 085-005-256-182-140; 093-211-598-564-234; 096-688-900-295-475; 098-052-891-518-284; 100-215-618-199-845; 102-189-739-165-015; 112-503-589-157-76X; 112-781-611-772-743; 115-742-028-266-103; 130-076-441-971-473; 131-406-655-883-482; 132-934-545-984-341; 135-775-247-148-541; 149-092-328-313-866; 149-990-674-266-913; 153-815-558-435-528; 163-048-583-490-949; 163-165-339-604-505; 185-383-918-375-00X,12,true,cc-by,gold

At present, business organization are moving towards Industry 5.0 (internet of thought) and GIG economy where the traditional way of fully relying on full time workers are no longer relevant. The world of work is changing. From organizational view, leap frogging strategy with technological advancement are significant to achieve competitive advantage to ensure the continuity of business. While from worker perspective, having technology driven talent is a must to face new business economy called as GIG economy. In other words, all workers in every industry including logistics should ensure they have technology driven talent in his/her portfolio to remain competitive in the working world. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the applicability of Industry 5.0 such as digitalization and mobile marketing to logistics players; to make them more visible to customer and competitor. Single case study method was adopted to study on the perspective as discussed above more in-depth. Findings from this single case study is transferable as it provides rich explanation and discussion from one of the earliest logistics company in Malaysia, with logistics experience almost five (5) decades in providing logistics services. The qualitative findings pointed out four key areas for LSP improvement. Firstly, all LSPs should go for transition process with their business model to provide them with new revenue - logistics digital business and allow them to be more visible to their customer by fully utilizing the promotion activities online. Secondly, every agreement with customer should be put into contract and it is paperless within system. Thirdly, digital payment is a must to all logistics players to practice in order for them to compete in digital era. Finally, and inevitability, to sustain in the business, logistics may move to become intelligent logistics players with carrying no asset and just focus on negotiating contracts with customers. This term refers to practising logistics players with no assets or less assets centric. In principle, the company does not own asset but able to provide logistics services (for example fleet and warehouses) by aggregating â€œinformation about assetsâ€ from people who do own them by leveraging on data. This article contributes to the logistics study by matching issue on digitalization and GIG economy in logistics sector. More work on future of logistics is needed with large sample across the globe in order to obtain more data to help the logistics players depict themselves in new economy.",8,2,1042,1048,Supply chain; Business; Revenue; New economy; Portfolio; Industrial organization; Business model; Competitive advantage; Promotion (rank); Asset (computer security),,,,,https://ojs.excelingtech.co.uk/index.php/IJSCM/article/download/3085/1597 https://ojs.excelingtech.co.uk/index.php/IJSCM/article/view/3085/1597,https://ojs.excelingtech.co.uk/index.php/IJSCM/article/view/3085/1597,,,2944939807,,0,,5,false,,

It has also freed business activity from a focus on place, as both work activities and markets have been able to harness information and communication technologies in order to operate remotely. As a result, researchers have highlighted a phenomenon of ‘smart’ working. Some have pointed to a fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) in which ‘smart’ factories use robotics to achieve high performance. There is now a suggestion of progress towards Industry 5.0, in which technological and social systems work in harmony to deliver personalised mass customization of products and services. This paper examines these developments from the perspective of unique, individual understandings of work roles and sustainability, posing the questions ‘Smart’ from whose point of view? Do smart systems promote sustainable organizations? How should design of smart systems be approached? It suggests that contemporary socio-technical systems approaches to organizational analysis are the best way to support harnessing of smart technologies in organizations.",22,2,281,298,Engineering; Sociotechnical system; Smart system; Organizational analysis; Sustainability organizations; Industry 4.0; Knowledge management; Sustainability; Information and Communications Technology; Mass customization,,,,University of Portsmouth,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:spr:infosf:v:22:y:2020:i:2:d:10.1007_s10796-019-09921-1 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10796-019-09921-1.pdf https://www.scilit.net/article/045597f38ab8e46bd3e4b6ef2cbd057d https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/isf/isf22.html#BednarW20 https://doi.org/10.1007/s10796-019-09921-1 https://portal.research.lu.se/en/publications/socio-technical-perspectives-on-smart-working-creating-meaningful https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/1ce530bd-2aa7-409e-b2b6-522a6b7c57b0 https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/portal/files/14211480/Socio_Technical_Perspectives_on_Smart_Working.pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/infosf/v22y2020i2d10.1007_s10796-019-09921-1.html https://puredev.port.ac.uk/en/publications/socio-technical-perspectives-on-smart-working-creating-meaningful https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10796-019-09921-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10796-019-09921-1,,10.1007/s10796-019-09921-1,2942942407,,0,003-022-686-079-899; 004-345-310-789-588; 005-678-500-548-787; 005-796-039-321-468; 006-558-608-005-442; 007-804-632-977-10X; 013-679-697-508-627; 014-461-421-539-363; 014-909-545-302-926; 015-041-524-925-027; 015-218-998-128-071; 018-345-855-897-35X; 019-385-196-565-281; 019-617-094-191-522; 020-423-916-366-775; 020-651-729-317-681; 021-741-156-825-990; 024-601-766-545-886; 024-863-314-645-595; 026-895-802-475-205; 028-922-696-189-478; 030-104-527-656-466; 030-314-174-466-581; 030-894-861-122-266; 031-293-783-222-28X; 034-442-957-662-943; 034-610-399-035-493; 043-024-581-749-788; 045-732-333-571-271; 050-056-756-492-428; 050-775-143-584-232; 050-860-336-524-54X; 051-038-112-216-29X; 052-121-237-562-341; 057-362-012-774-107; 057-981-589-705-723; 059-198-406-242-083; 060-210-028-318-574; 061-106-551-419-704; 063-999-037-292-53X; 064-847-525-020-457; 067-945-789-277-668; 068-449-861-799-326; 071-387-505-557-483; 072-144-569-097-965; 072-835-920-895-175; 073-123-784-675-864; 082-193-643-919-968; 086-285-005-719-092; 088-273-808-364-904; 091-841-640-811-109; 092-699-978-647-571; 097-244-778-994-553; 098-533-945-081-821; 103-283-718-200-405; 104-693-310-977-403; 104-963-683-392-202; 105-179-598-653-786; 111-918-374-133-371; 112-861-543-573-16X; 114-333-407-393-539; 116-059-643-746-15X; 117-376-485-698-53X; 123-744-689-550-151; 124-346-728-819-292; 124-608-872-203-393; 125-795-343-058-314; 130-454-466-144-47X; 130-540-877-159-511; 134-950-813-808-882; 136-481-382-051-219; 137-185-405-417-755; 137-212-418-154-019; 138-383-642-197-075; 140-488-596-514-465; 145-614-119-612-544; 148-147-612-350-364; 150-145-703-941-867; 150-311-659-083-789; 152-317-375-052-868; 153-062-580-291-31X; 158-785-343-262-786; 159-117-779-555-822; 163-637-734-144-951; 176-241-134-682-896; 185-492-912-762-888; 186-041-334-475-521; 190-388-862-099-07X; 199-591-752-874-216,84,true,cc-by,hybrid
047-344-282-300-84X,"Source Apportionment of Volatile Organic Compounds, CO, SO2 and Trace Metals in a complex urban atmosphere",,2021,journal article,Environmental Advances,26667657,Elsevier BV,,Morshad Ahmed; Bernhard Rappenglück; Sourav Das; Shankararaman Chellam,"Abstract A commixture of gasphase compounds including carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and trace metals were collected at a site located at the urban/industrial interface in Houston, Texas. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis yielded nine factors: gas/crude oil (21.3±5.5%), isoprene emission (17.0±7.1%), Si-rich (14.6±1.3%), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) (11.2±4.0%), traffic (10.6±0.4%), Fluidized-bed Catalytic Cracking (FCC)/high temperature operations (7.2±4.3%), oil refinery (6.8±0.9%), soil and road dust (6.2±0.6%), and petrochemical industries (5.0±5.0%). Daytime and nighttime PMF runs were carried out to see potential differences among and within emission sources. Notable findings include: (1) Nocturnal isoprene emission was identified from traffic exhaust and industrial sources. (2) LPG emissions were higher during the day most likely due to temperature dependent evaporative processes. (3) V/Ni and SO2/V ratios reveal greater contribution from crude oil in the merged natural gas/crude oil emission factor. Corrosion might be responsible for emitting metals (i.e., Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni) from oil refineries during nighttime. (4) In the soil and road dust factor, metals relevant to plant physiological processes are mostly retained by the plants while the lanthanoids and other metals (i.e. Y, Pb, Mn, Ga, Ba) are more prone to physical removal during the day. (5) FCC/high temperature operations are dominated by metals at night. (6) The traffic factor increases during the day possibly due to the higher number of vehicles. Bivariate polar plots suggest the Houston Ship Channel area as the primary emission source for LPG, natural gas/crude oil, FCC/high temperature operations, and petrochemical industries.",6,,100127,,Environmental chemistry; Petrochemical; Liquefied petroleum gas; Oil refinery; Isoprene; Fluid catalytic cracking; Environmental science; Carbon monoxide; Sulfur; Natural gas,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666765721000983,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envadv.2021.100127,,10.1016/j.envadv.2021.100127,3207105034,,0,000-198-604-899-456; 000-254-627-172-157; 000-563-942-718-69X; 000-631-771-768-52X; 001-148-265-337-31X; 002-457-758-209-83X; 002-638-826-169-300; 004-817-369-403-136; 005-328-191-062-66X; 006-561-664-092-314; 006-818-449-404-056; 009-522-467-884-889; 010-459-517-729-454; 012-390-519-137-671; 012-915-706-239-269; 013-153-145-652-464; 014-043-503-212-071; 014-272-997-523-521; 015-021-448-713-197; 015-781-584-224-541; 016-376-269-082-253; 016-670-454-184-814; 016-774-603-185-244; 016-875-284-382-605; 017-047-812-413-659; 017-058-565-632-275; 019-531-196-976-040; 019-693-608-184-210; 020-726-713-242-535; 021-507-426-351-09X; 022-763-744-578-571; 023-229-001-860-88X; 025-177-298-126-950; 025-872-445-030-997; 026-652-179-611-108; 026-927-079-034-307; 027-993-161-624-375; 028-223-928-544-393; 028-907-242-920-902; 029-066-428-528-549; 029-790-399-780-637; 032-000-890-218-969; 034-594-317-153-57X; 037-653-188-696-979; 039-124-407-305-472; 039-198-521-781-773; 040-710-715-289-619; 042-037-420-810-329; 043-445-392-353-165; 046-647-541-642-29X; 047-926-662-526-007; 048-763-655-933-221; 050-049-955-671-722; 050-583-585-399-732; 050-648-011-093-317; 051-091-376-593-980; 051-359-197-179-025; 052-166-853-980-538; 053-880-596-724-203; 057-126-416-482-755; 058-596-549-788-048; 058-996-322-710-433; 060-418-954-285-495; 061-236-051-378-315; 063-652-896-647-922; 063-935-936-727-303; 064-121-984-200-315; 065-276-291-337-629; 065-290-133-313-657; 065-666-287-437-719; 066-857-551-595-205; 067-567-842-040-833; 068-689-254-706-629; 069-390-512-925-606; 069-469-879-445-360; 070-466-485-995-978; 072-471-802-649-93X; 073-154-462-959-137; 073-390-756-856-189; 074-305-464-253-367; 075-312-212-076-941; 076-528-303-676-773; 077-042-073-279-153; 078-516-133-166-205; 078-907-315-255-055; 080-925-643-190-175; 081-236-591-562-813; 083-388-636-146-721; 088-147-917-894-181; 092-045-710-689-399; 096-562-731-547-227; 097-262-556-279-721; 099-921-303-292-222; 101-927-920-247-838; 102-030-154-850-776; 104-026-009-503-170; 105-547-058-044-214; 108-927-761-883-865; 110-511-716-268-823; 110-715-764-748-658; 113-084-060-361-421; 115-335-526-716-439; 117-387-829-219-592; 119-177-430-858-293; 120-151-785-099-484; 122-300-449-215-73X; 122-483-940-203-813; 123-751-398-087-270; 124-300-199-549-683; 124-886-495-064-198; 125-525-591-387-993; 125-681-618-626-320; 125-969-663-610-486; 130-000-640-085-895; 131-336-420-228-28X; 135-728-017-546-93X; 141-508-086-528-13X; 141-718-502-766-010; 142-478-110-001-621; 145-856-491-014-294; 146-232-911-754-610; 147-269-616-438-653; 157-411-722-555-228; 159-323-465-729-655; 173-089-728-349-609; 175-786-978-122-438; 182-477-940-631-792; 184-686-236-716-083,2,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

V. Babkin; A. A. Fedorov; I. V. Liberman; P. M. Klachek,"<jats:p>At present in Europe and Russia there are active discussions of the next mega stage of human social and economic development. It concerns the Industry 5.0 concept. In 2020–2021 members of scientific research and technological organizations discussed the aspects of Industry 5.0 at a number of well-known European and Russian forums. Major attention was paid to technologies maintaining Industry 5.0. As a result the world scientific community reached a consensus on two fronts: firstly, on integration of opportunities of the existing technologies of Industry 4.0 with the human-oriented approach of Industry 5.0 which will give way to harmonious interaction of human intelligence with cognitive calculations; and, secondly, on integration of human and machine intelligence to create collective intelligence which will make it possible to avoid technological singularity in future as well as provide for simultaneous humans’ evolution and technologies’ development. These will become the basis for creating a fundamentally new social, economic and cultural strategy of the society’s development for the coming decades. The strategy is based on applying collective intelligence and meta-system technologies in all spheres of life. For the first time in the world scientific practice the authors introduce the concept of Industry 5.0 as a cyber social system which allows the alliance of human and artificial intelligence aimed at creating collective super intelligence and becomes a source of harmonious technological development of human civilization. The authors present a neuro-ecosystem model of Industry 5.0 concept which will make it possible to set the task of implementing the systems of global meta-system strategized development of cognitive production and industry. Such systems are established as part of organization of cognitive production and new types of social and economic, cyber-social and industrial ecosystems by means of implementing collective intelligence and neuro-digital meta-technologies. This is the first stage of a new evolution process of developing Industry 4.0 concept, transition to Industry 5.0 and to meta-system transformations economics.</jats:p>",14,4,375,395,Collective intelligence; Human intelligence; Alliance; Civilization; Knowledge management; Business; Social intelligence; Management science; Political science,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17073/2072-1633-2021-4-375-395,,10.17073/2072-1633-2021-4-375-395,,,0,001-475-244-398-234; 007-677-839-948-112; 012-383-870-345-915; 016-960-631-561-12X; 023-249-438-026-44X; 027-487-446-697-250; 036-969-668-872-606; 054-763-483-892-140; 061-391-711-898-798; 085-657-106-088-742; 086-570-869-629-820; 097-219-554-982-559; 102-491-404-681-787; 128-536-480-238-453; 169-380-214-360-631; 169-890-254-909-06X,2,true,cc-by,gold

Rupa; Divya Midhunchakkaravarthy; Mohammad Kamrul Hasan; Hesham Alhumyani; Rashid A. Saeed,"The use of advanced technologies has increased drastically to maintain any sensitive records related to education, health, or finance. It helps to protect the data from unauthorized access by attackers. However, all the existing advanced technologies face some issues because of their uncertainties. These technologies have some lapses to provide privacy, attack-free, transparency, reliability, and flexibility. These characteristics are essential while managing any sensitive data like educational certificates or medical certificates. Hence, we designed an Industry 5.0 based blockchain application to manage medical certificates using Remix Ethereum blockchain in this paper. This application also employs a distributed application (DApp) that uses a test RPC-based Ethereum blockchain and user expert system as a knowledge agent. The main strength of this work is the maintenance of existing certificates over a blockchain with the creation of new certificates that use logistic Map encryption cipher on existing medical certificates while uploading into the blockchain. This application helps to quickly analyze the birth, death, and sick rate as per certain features like location and year.",18,5,7010,7027,Encryption; Blockchain; Smart contract; Cipher; Flexibility (engineering); Computer security; Computer science; Expert system; Upload; Transparency (human–computer interaction),Industry 5.0 ;  Logistic Map Encryption cipher ;  health care certificate ;  knowledge agent ;  metamask ;  remix Ethereum ;  testRPC,Blockchain; Privacy; Reproducibility of Results; Technology,,,https://www.aimspress.com/article/doi/10.3934/mbe.2021349,http://dx.doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2021349,34517569,10.3934/mbe.2021349,3195547701,,0,001-921-873-282-100; 003-849-741-165-307; 007-020-271-129-280; 008-092-872-335-265; 008-307-323-937-779; 021-412-511-733-103; 025-737-444-182-145; 026-826-359-172-488; 030-620-187-442-373; 033-884-245-140-575; 038-806-445-494-018; 039-612-120-652-541; 040-587-925-168-929; 042-498-631-309-640; 046-314-000-637-206; 048-092-008-205-493; 057-239-048-569-11X; 061-909-337-739-060; 065-216-099-007-625; 067-602-459-710-970; 074-849-299-992-419; 076-029-993-940-925; 084-880-394-985-442; 095-603-940-135-095; 097-445-943-808-699; 104-627-194-782-83X; 111-488-095-711-880; 113-165-364-713-005; 113-560-528-708-545; 118-227-422-280-440; 124-704-005-863-641; 144-474-200-818-648; 149-035-835-855-095; 168-127-555-363-421; 186-621-468-641-792; 192-879-018-657-952,11,true,cc-by,gold

The theme of Industry 4.0 is ""Smart Manufacturing for the Future"". Now, some futurists even discuss what the fifth industrial revolution’s theme will be. There are a few visions for Industry 5.0. One emerging theme is human-robot co-working. In recent years, we have seen significant advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) research. Today, there are robots for various purposes at affordable prices in the market. It is not long before we closely interact with robots in our lives and workplaces. Testing autonomous cars in traffic is a promising example of this upcoming trend. There are companies having an employee record for robots or AI applications. While there are many studies on human-robot collaboration for low-level tasks with a focus on robot development, we lack studies focusing on organizational issues emerging from human-robot co-working. In this study, we discuss the possible issues related to human-robot co-working from the organizational and human employee’s perspective.

Bokoro; Ravi Sharma,"Industry 4.0 have witnessed a paradigm shift from cyber-physical systems (CPS) that aims at massive automation, towards a more customer-driven approach. The shift has been attributed to the design of hyper-cognitive systems, integration of virtual and extended reality, digital machinery prototyping and twin designs, trusted machine boundaries, collaborative robots, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based supply chains. This new wave, termed Industry 5.0, is expected to leverage massive production with user-centric customization outside the scope of Industry 4.0 ecosystems. Industry 5.0 is expected to assist diverse industrial verticals like healthcare, smart farming, drones, smart grids, and supply chain production ecosystems. However, data is shared among multiple heterogeneous networks, spanning different authoritative domains. Thus, trusted and secured data transfer is crucial to synergize and secure the industrial perimeters. Blockchain (BC) is a preferred choice as a security enabler to Industry 5.0 ecosystems owing to its inherent property of immutability, chronology, and auditability in industrial systems. Limited works are proposed that present the vision and holistic view of BC-assisted Industry 5.0 applications. The article presents a first-of-its-kind survey on BC as a security enabler in Industry 5.0.

051-405-758-544-980,A Study on Generating Novel Inventions Based on F-Term Classification,,2017,conference proceedings article,2017 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology (PICMET),,IEEE,,Yuichi Ohtsuka; Masakazu Takahashi,"This paper proposes a new invention creation method using patent classification information. Currently, innovation in nearly every field is being generated by the spread of information technology such as IoT and ICT. In Japan, major changes are expected in the country's economic and social structure with the emergence of the ""hyper-smart society"" (Society 5.0) in the not-so-distant future. In this context, promoting technology-led new inventions in a way that avoids overlapping investment and duplicate research will be essential. In this paper, we propose a method to capture trends in innovation by taking advantage of the information available in Japan's F-term classification system. Uniquely, the F-term system uses a meta-classification structure, with classification tables for each technology unit, identified by ""theme code."" By using multiple theme codes, including those for informationrelated technologies, it is possible to compare various technologies. Classification tables are indicators of the current common technical knowledge. These can be a source leading to the creation of new inventions by allowing innovators to identify viewpoints that have not already been explored. Discovering a new invention can also lead to a promising inventive next step. From the result of the analysis, our proposed method of the Fterm classification system to foster new inventions related to information technology is effective for capturing the technology trend.",,,1,6,Information technology; Code (cryptography); Structure (mathematical logic); Data science; Viewpoints; Context (language use); Patent classification; Field (computer science); Computer science; Information and Communications Technology,,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=8125331,http://dx.doi.org/10.23919/picmet.2017.8125331,,10.23919/picmet.2017.8125331,2773541553,,0,006-788-103-505-138; 017-312-459-516-386; 018-154-827-006-490; 028-516-471-067-126; 030-988-542-366-930; 033-770-179-985-776; 061-847-495-404-572; 080-638-060-518-536; 094-435-916-366-284; 102-882-321-306-795; 103-835-916-814-662; 115-497-138-988-856,0,false,,

At this time learning must be oriented in Industrial Era 4.0 and the educational paradigm must be change in systems thinking to the top level of Bloom revised taxonomy. The researchers analyzed how to apply using Reflective Metacognitive Learning (RML) model and integrated Garrison, Anderson, and Archer model to achieve Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) of KKNI Curriculum at Institut Ilmu AL Qur’an Jakarta in Islamic study program. This research based on a qualitative approach with descriptive analysis method. The data was obtained from the fifth semester students of Islamic Education Program of Institut Ilmu Al-Quran (IIQ) Jakarta and from all relevant sources such as interviews, observations, and documentations. The findings showed that the application of the Reflective-Metacognitive Learning (RML) model integrated with the Garrison, Anderson, and Archer model was found in the four critical thinking skills of (IIQ) Jakarta students in learning, for instance: (1) students are quick to respond to events (trigger event), (2) students are more able to explore (exploration) (3) students can integrate knowledge into the context of learning (integration) and (4) then students propose (resolution). It was important that the application of these two models can improve the learning process and level of thinking of Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) metacognitive levels.&#x0D;; Keywords: High Order Thinking Skills, HOTS, Reflective-Metacognitive Learning, KKNI Curriculum</jats:p>",5,1,145,157,Metacognition; Mathematics education; Psychology; Order (business); Curriculum,,,,,https://journal.iaimnumetrolampung.ac.id/index.php/ji/article/download/842/526 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/327192971.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.25217/ji.v5i1.842,,10.25217/ji.v5i1.842,3035337226,,0,096-262-597-607-510; 098-738-108-459-97X; 163-439-217-950-018; 164-829-179-256-921; 193-085-476-672-641,0,true,cc-by-sa,gold

It was predicted that the society is not ready to face this era if they analyse moral cases occur in West Java. Most people who adhere to this religion of Islam, have not been able to fully realize the Islamic values​ in daily life. Ideally, education as a mediator in dealing with these cases presents a solution. Therefore, this article was to provide a basic inspiration regarding the innovation of the Islamic education curriculum based on the values ​​of Sundanese cultural characters. This research uses library research’s method by using inductive-deductive analysis as well as a comparison of literature and content analysis techniques. The result showed that the presence of an Islamic education curriculum based on cultural Sundanese character values ​​could emerge a generation that upholds culture and Islam. Hence,  it could make the next generation of a nation to have noble character.&#x0D;; Keywords: Sundanese Culture, Era Society 5.0, Curriculum, Islamic Education</jats:p>",5,1,104,119,Political science; Pedagogy; Character (mathematics); Islamic education; Curriculum,,,,,https://journal.iaimnumetrolampung.ac.id/index.php/ji/article/download/910/509 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/327192978.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.25217/ji.v5i1.910,,10.25217/ji.v5i1.910,3034768241,,0,,2,true,cc-by-sa,gold

To maintain production and adjust quickly to technological transformation, innovative work-based learning approaches are emphasized. Intelligent machines are becoming capable of interaction and collaboration with humans. They not only introduce a new type of learnable workforce to manufacturing but may open opportunities to enhance learning of all learners. Symbiotic relationships of humans and machines have wide potential for human-centric manufacturing (aka Industry 5.0). Moreover, connecting smart devices and deploying self-learning solutions is envisioned to increase flexibility of manufacturing, thus changing work division between humans and machines. Where humans and machines collaborate, the term Reciprocal Learning has been coined to describe the process of bidirectional learning. While a definition of Reciprocal Learning exists the boundary conditions of the concept are still ambiguous. In this paper, a framework for Reciprocal Learning in Human-Machine Collaboration for Industry 5.0 is presented to clarify what it is and what it isn’t. The approach is based on a multi-agent system perspective, comprising human and machine agents. Finally, an outlook on future research is presented.</jats:p>",,,207,225,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.30844/wgab_2022_11,,10.30844/wgab_2022_11,,,0,,0,false,,

A unified functional structure of simulators, information, mathematics, and software was created, which is a flexible customizable environment for this class of objects. Based on the information and mathematical support, training scenarios are developed in which different situations and disturbances are modeled by changing the model coefficients and varying the values of variables in the ranges of change. To develop interfaces as close as possible to real objects in a limited time frame, a SCADA HMI was used. The methodology for the development of computer simulators has been tested on the example of electrochemical and electrothermal production of aluminum, calcium carbide, and phosphorus. The efficiency of computer simulators is confirmed by the results of approbation for Russian industrial enterprises, scientific and educational organizations.KeywordsComputer simulatorsTraining of control industry personnelResource-saving controlElectrotechnological installations",,,351,363,SCADA; Computer science; Control (management); Frame (networking); Resource (disambiguation); Variety (cybernetics); Software; Engineering management; Systems engineering,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-95112-2_29,,10.1007/978-3-030-95112-2_29,,,0,027-280-162-203-492; 031-281-368-816-007; 043-980-799-658-395; 044-246-416-116-637; 050-769-230-822-744; 060-856-729-459-030; 079-769-377-141-495; 080-783-743-190-534; 081-467-326-259-635; 113-396-349-085-707; 133-254-395-322-250; 153-486-709-322-180; 175-090-625-676-085,0,false,,

Current human Competences-Capacities that are supported by the technological enablers could result in a radically disempowered human factor. This means that in the processes of optimization and improvement of manufacturing systems from industry 4.0 to industry 5.0, it would be necessary to establish strategies for the empowerment of the human factor, which constitute symbiotic and co-evolutionary socio-technical systems through talent, sustainability, and innovation.

Ivanov; Li Da Xu,"Rapid advances in technology have spurred tremendous progress in developing the next generation of Industry 4.0 that was initially introduced in 2011 as a German strategic initiative for revolutionizing the manufacturing sector. Ten years have passed since 2011. In these ten years, numerous new and promising technologies and applications have been developed. The original concept of Industry 4.0, including the conceptual framework, technology framework, and enabling technologies, has experienced tremendous changes. As such, the new generation of Industry 4.0 emerges, which is also called Industry 5.0. Today, we are on the cusp of the Industry 4.0 evolution supported by a new set of enabling technologies. In such evolution of Industry 4.0, future Industry 4.0 requires a combination of recently emerging new technologies, which is giving rise to the emergence of the next generation of Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. Such technologies originate from different disciplines, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), 5G/6G, Quantum Computing, and others. The technologies in the original Industry 4.0 framework, such as Cyber-Physical Systems, IoT, etc., will be affected by Artificial Intelligence (AI), 5G/6G, and Quantum Computing. At this present moment, the emergence of a new era of Industry 4.0 can be seen. In this paper, we briefly survey the main emerging enabling technologies in Industry 4.0 as it relates to industries.",,,,,Emerging technologies; Industry 4.0; Computer science; Cyber-physical system; Engineering management; Business,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10796-021-10213-w,,10.1007/s10796-021-10213-w,,,0,001-145-281-169-551; 001-304-176-620-967; 001-441-142-745-543; 001-484-771-040-36X; 002-080-619-054-658; 004-897-635-729-60X; 006-144-901-493-553; 006-176-276-300-74X; 006-684-197-312-209; 007-757-963-501-529; 007-775-092-907-652; 007-843-174-898-720; 008-050-025-738-949; 008-231-584-738-665; 010-522-144-826-807; 010-803-629-094-705; 011-112-865-135-787; 013-214-330-694-611; 016-492-463-725-089; 017-281-000-480-800; 019-968-167-779-63X; 020-191-111-891-37X; 020-488-554-808-114; 020-642-882-168-526; 020-649-956-170-47X; 023-338-902-971-862; 024-957-679-083-115; 026-162-899-974-941; 026-566-690-842-906; 028-118-178-626-124; 029-326-383-227-598; 029-333-074-857-655; 030-981-304-540-583; 031-064-329-595-52X; 032-219-661-977-845; 032-450-366-441-855; 032-560-303-265-425; 032-628-499-344-78X; 035-057-839-585-890; 035-793-573-070-27X; 038-196-787-346-28X; 038-835-087-445-04X; 038-904-037-813-023; 039-809-166-788-304; 040-289-668-179-276; 040-702-618-287-339; 041-573-822-021-544; 042-310-389-822-325; 042-457-938-079-463; 042-611-611-135-403; 042-827-844-183-978; 044-336-501-892-074; 045-583-664-369-557; 049-091-093-966-757; 051-229-133-805-431; 055-140-121-585-907; 058-714-039-993-169; 063-694-233-570-544; 068-362-832-317-496; 068-432-226-639-576; 069-021-348-303-720; 071-947-567-046-059; 072-900-763-568-602; 074-361-501-223-498; 078-115-305-452-674; 078-717-179-242-550; 080-406-450-644-623; 081-980-544-620-123; 085-349-449-424-547; 087-646-817-053-211; 093-177-277-265-819; 094-389-981-570-420; 094-920-682-342-675; 095-178-485-519-737; 095-259-092-795-401; 099-373-385-765-024; 099-575-167-150-633; 099-620-413-902-782; 100-200-862-489-308; 102-639-638-550-649; 112-036-703-735-384; 116-036-405-942-065; 117-822-947-054-825; 119-183-159-340-104; 119-198-691-463-188; 130-038-539-940-723; 132-544-044-621-215; 132-656-350-668-982; 132-819-223-566-952; 137-159-520-321-135; 146-717-335-613-160; 149-583-685-878-482; 151-265-372-282-096; 167-137-343-553-103; 170-399-611-010-577,19,false,,

And this is true not only for companies in the high-tech sector, but also for those who are part of the supply chains of natural resources such as natural gas. Moreover, in addition to the flexibility of technological solutions, natural gas supply companies are expected to protect their place in the renewable / regenerative / economy, which defines natural gas as one of the clean energy sources. To meet these challenges, the article examines how and in what way the ongoing global crisis provoked by the COVID 19 pandemic is slowing down the processes of technological digitalization and integration of business processes in gas supply companies, i.e., to what extent these companies have ""walked the path"" of the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0. We are looking for answers to these questions on the basis of an empirical study conducted in gas companies, showing the change in the level of technological innovation, the development of linkages between individual business processes, and the place of artificial intelligence in their overall activities.</jats:p>",4,1,,,Bulgarian; Flexibility (engineering); Natural gas industry; Business; Technological change; Industrial organization; Natural gas; Pandemic; Commerce; Economics; Economy,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.30880/jstard.2022.04.01.001,,10.30880/jstard.2022.04.01.001,,,0,,0,false,,

Regular instances of fraudulent acts reveal a lack of openness in agriculture supply chains, raising worries about financial losses, eroding customer trust, and lowering corporate brand value. To develop an efficient and reliable trading environment, several fundamental modifications in the present supply chain architecture are required. There is broad consensus that blockchain can improve transparency in agriculture-food supply chains (agri-food SCs). Consumers now demand safe, sustainable, and equitable food production processes, and businesses are using blockchains and the internet of things to meet these needs. For enhanced responsiveness in agri-food SCs, new concepts have evolved that combine blockchains with various Industry 5.0 technologies (e.g., blockchain technology, big data, internet of things (IoT), radio frequency identification (RFID), near field communication (NFC), etc.). It is critical to cut through the hype and examine the technology’s limits, which might stymie its acceptance, implementation, and scalability in agri-food supply chains.

One possibility to decrease the educational inequality is to provide remote access to facilities that enable learning and training. A similar approach of remote resource usage can be utilized in resource-poor situations where the required equipment is available at other premises. The concept of Industry 5.0 (i5.0) focuses on a human-centric approach, enabling technologies to concentrate on human–machine interaction and emphasizing the importance of societal values. This paper introduces a novel robotics teleoperation platform supported by the i5.0. The platform reduces inequality and allows usage and learning of robotics remotely independently of time and location. The platform is based on digital twins with bi-directional data transmission between the physical and digital counterparts. The proposed system allows teleoperation, remote programming, and near real-time monitoring of controlled robots, robot time scheduling, and social interaction between users.

In most applications, Industry 5.0 showed a significant connection between intelligent systems and humans through accurate manufacturing automation with critical thinking skills. Also, Industry 5.0 brings several competent tools that help organizations work inexpensively and instantly change without any principal investment. In recent years, smart devices, wireless communication, and sensor nodes have made considerable advances, making the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of interconnected, Internet-connected devices that can capture and transmit data without the need for human interaction over a wireless network. With the introduction of IoT, human beings take some relaxed and unburden feelings. IoT devices enable users to obtain information even in rural surroundings and prepare reports without restrictions. In addition, they accurately guide human beings with intelligent judgments via communication, as mentioned earlier, technologies. Numerous connected devices collect a considerable quantity of raw sensed data, where it needs pre-processing. However, only it turns into something valuable because of IoT devices’ adequate resources entailed to edge computing. Artificial intelligence-based algorithms are the necessary means for information inference in edge computing. Besides, the sensed data accumulated from IoT applications are generally unstructured and need further analysis, where AI-based models help extract relevant information.Furthermore, transmitting data from device to device, there is a chance for malicious attacks. Hence, this chapter explores Industry 5.0, IoT architecture, and AI-based IoT; we analyze IoT network’s technical details; communication enables technologies. Then we discussed various AI-based technologies integrated into IoT, AI-based tools, edge computing, and trust models for IoT appliances.",,,3,45,Computer science; Automation; Edge computing; The Internet; Internet of Things; Computer security; Data science; Artificial intelligence,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-87059-1_1,,10.1007/978-3-030-87059-1_1,,,0,000-550-105-437-10X; 002-526-389-502-630; 004-265-488-060-946; 008-124-206-643-913; 008-177-910-837-147; 009-294-445-259-925; 012-554-893-466-713; 014-080-719-704-799; 017-415-713-662-955; 018-394-636-867-442; 025-938-613-156-193; 028-399-730-528-936; 030-278-333-246-135; 036-112-758-912-242; 040-206-919-048-419; 041-864-734-480-775; 048-215-912-217-713; 049-716-552-536-295; 058-423-376-497-393; 068-848-414-484-582; 071-912-361-341-140; 074-329-108-826-399; 082-826-726-055-971; 100-549-579-714-540; 100-842-538-081-76X; 104-828-920-871-740; 111-084-634-675-524; 114-116-684-871-032; 120-733-405-124-108; 125-795-343-058-314; 127-368-383-666-089; 138-332-915-687-580; 139-472-527-994-088; 166-545-567-182-766; 176-021-599-954-551,2,false,,

In industrial design and engineering, HCD is very useful in helping to achieve the novel Industry 5.0 concept, based on improving workers’ wellbeing by providing prosperity beyond jobs and growth, while respecting the production limits of the planet as recently promoted by the European Commission. In this context, the paper proposes an ergonomic assessment method based on the analysis of the workers’ workload to support the design of industrial products and processes. This allows the simultaneous analysis of the physical and cognitive workload of operators while performing their tasks during their shift. The method uses a minimum set of non-invasive wearable devices to monitor human activity and physiological parameters, in addition to questionnaires for subjective self-assessment. The method has been preliminarily tested on a real industrial case in order to demonstrate how it can help companies to support the design of optimized products and processes promoting the workers’ wellbeing.</jats:p>",11,24,12066,12066,Workload; Prosperity; Industrial design; Computer science; Industrial production; Context (archaeology); Production (economics); Wearable computer; Set (abstract data type); Order (exchange); Risk analysis (engineering); Engineering; Manufacturing engineering,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app112412066,,10.3390/app112412066,,,0,000-092-050-655-912; 001-610-028-097-719; 011-797-116-120-363; 015-653-610-660-552; 015-983-125-274-991; 016-666-693-760-450; 017-347-484-948-762; 017-846-386-908-966; 020-090-924-990-874; 022-549-364-411-596; 029-170-236-791-182; 031-294-750-698-550; 031-327-169-344-060; 031-536-913-674-625; 032-407-189-277-21X; 033-460-825-764-692; 033-501-434-688-037; 034-656-952-641-047; 037-640-436-356-285; 039-529-798-287-94X; 041-064-292-292-439; 041-409-865-990-383; 052-363-292-004-512; 054-779-705-781-240; 055-172-065-076-628; 062-039-691-567-329; 064-232-901-689-613; 071-959-788-500-196; 073-439-602-104-579; 078-717-879-357-64X; 084-009-219-588-397; 087-157-957-268-743; 091-157-237-382-235; 094-300-412-136-41X; 112-003-142-597-733; 112-329-009-122-851; 116-307-443-152-314; 135-922-279-158-08X; 138-097-221-744-109; 138-529-852-670-835; 142-819-164-052-144; 165-437-465-098-550; 172-463-005-761-596; 172-747-711-784-669; 186-646-547-409-28X; 193-761-582-495-002,2,true,cc-by,gold

The area of AI is an interdisciplinary field, which has been designated as a strategic area in the European Union (EU) approach and a key driver of economic development that can bring solutions to many social challenges and problems. Due to its nature and its tendency to be digitally advanced and smarter with analytics, the financial sector is one of the early adopters of AI and expects multiple benefits from its application, that is, the ability to provide better service in the shortest time possible and at a lower cost. AI in the financial sector is based on an understanding of the business needs of financial organizations, institutions and markets and the ability to connect with technological capabilities. They are powerful tools that completely transform this sector. The basic idea of this paper is to consider where the real value of AI in the financial sector is, i.e. what are the practical aspects and business implications of AI in the financial sector globally. It is common knowledge that evolving technologies have always had a strong impact on the sectors in which they are applied because they give them the opportunity to improve existing manufacturing processes, services, customer experiences, operate more efficiently, achieve cost savings, etc. The aim of this paper is to identify areas of application of AI in the financial sector, and to explore leading AI applications that are changing the financial ecosystem, transforming the financial sector and that have the potential to significantly improve many of its functions. The paper further highlights other implications of AI implementation in the financial sector such as employment - job creation and termination of existing AI-influenced employment, the scope and potential of application in developing countries, the problem of regulation and use in the best interests of man, and the importance of properly managing specific AI risks.",8,19,67,81,Finance; Human intelligence; Early adopter; Business; Artificial intelligence; Applications of artificial intelligence; Order (exchange); Common knowledge; European union; Service (economics); Analytics,,,,,https://www.bibliotekabijeljina.rs.ba/index.php/zrefis/article/view/6482 https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=828906 https://doisrpska.nub.rs/index.php/zrefis/article/download/6482/6351 https://doisrpska.nub.rs/index.php/zrefis/article/view/6482 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/287192453.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.7251/zrefis1919067g,,10.7251/zrefis1919067g,3006290725,,0,,3,true,,gold

Many countries have introduced similar strategic initiatives, and a considerable research effort has been spent on developing and implementing some of the Industry 4.0 technologies. At the ten-year mark of the introduction of Industry 4.0, the European Commission announced Industry 5.0. Industry 4.0 is considered to be technology-driven, whereas Industry 5.0 is value-driven.

For this purpose, the results of a literature review will be mobilized, as well as our 20 years of experience in teaching and research in the fields of sociology, education and organizations, without forgetting the publications that we have on similar topics, which will be, whenever heuristically relevant, mobilized to substantiate and justify the arguments presented herein. The conclusions show that, in a reality where the digital involves many of the life dimensions—for example, in the form of Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0—the role of literacy and, in particular, digital literacy, are critical in the development of sustainability literacy. For this to be possible, significant training work must be carried out. Furthermore, it is not possible to assume that the access, the skills in its use and the benefits of this wonderful digital world will automatically be grasped and felt by all citizens, in an ideology that must be fought.

West,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a cost-effective method to support the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and is an enabling technology for Industry 5.0. The use of RFID is particularly suited to IIoT as it does not require a line of sight for communication and can be retroactively affixed to non-smart items. However, RFID communication is affected by the properties of the material the tag is affixed to, specifically the material permittivity. Metal is commonly present in smart factory environments and supply chains and impedes RFID communication. A suitable tag design is required to accommodate these challenges and ensure resilience for Industry 5.0 applications. The research presented in this paper has assessed the communication performance of RFID antenna designs with and without metal present beneath the tag. The RFID tag designs that performed reliably in the simulation were manufactured, and their read range was tested on materials of varying relative permittivity and thickness to represent MP and NMP scenarios. The results have verified the robustness of “Cyber” to “Physical” designs and provide recommendations to support practitioner IIoT tag selection.; </jats:p>",121,5-6,3903,3917,Robustness (evolution); Internet of Things; Radio-frequency identification; Supply chain; Computer science; Factory (object-oriented programming); Industry 4.0; Engineering; Embedded system,,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00170-022-09576-4,,10.1007/s00170-022-09576-4,,,0,003-574-818-017-848; 005-858-971-252-825; 006-000-717-661-614; 010-874-227-337-696; 012-635-762-249-975; 029-051-152-251-523; 045-484-156-276-449; 051-686-204-823-295; 064-119-255-100-928; 066-032-702-868-316; 068-605-798-715-071; 072-084-219-287-388; 094-912-338-403-993; 096-181-264-208-496; 098-271-432-456-619; 105-591-186-231-514; 108-189-183-258-272; 112-596-097-344-02X; 112-717-076-088-678; 121-891-824-749-09X; 131-133-972-142-521; 152-707-246-845-89X; 163-830-088-771-081; 167-525-067-938-633,1,true,,hybrid

Concretely, the milestone set for Industry 4.0 was to improve the sustainability and efficiency of production systems. By extension, the emphasis was focused on both the digitization and the digitalization of systems, providing room for further improvement. However, the current technological evolution is more system/machine-oriented, rather than human-oriented. Thus, several countries have begun orchestrating initiatives towards the design and development of the human-centric aspect of technologies, systems, and services, which has been coined as Industry 5.0. The impact of Industry 5.0 will extend to societal transformation, which eventually leads to the generation of a new society, the Society 5.0. The developments will be focused on the social and human-centric aspect of the tools and technologies introduced under the framework of Industry 4.0. Therefore, sustainability and human well-being will be at the heart of what comes next, the Industry 5.0, as a subset of Society 5.0. Industry 5.0 will build on the foundations laid during Industry 4.0 by emphasizing human-centered, resilient, and sustainable design. Consequently, the authors in this research work, through a critical literature review, aim to provide adequate reasoning for considering Industry 5.0 as a framework for enabling the coexistence of industry and emerging societal trends and needs. The contribution of this research work extends to the provision of a framework to facilitate the transition from Industry 4.0 to Society 5.0.</jats:p>",15,17,6276,6276,Industry 4.0; Milestone; Sustainability; Scope (computer science); Digitization; Emerging technologies; Work (physics); Engineering management; Engineering; Business; Management science,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15176276,,10.3390/en15176276,,,0,002-052-422-936-00X; 003-775-201-739-825; 004-970-916-760-02X; 006-420-918-875-724; 015-008-734-610-504; 016-245-823-947-788; 017-415-713-662-955; 020-916-140-650-888; 023-194-785-449-767; 027-194-470-119-742; 033-543-419-909-757; 046-446-925-840-307; 048-092-008-205-493; 048-840-098-633-459; 049-427-149-993-807; 056-892-778-681-803; 059-551-873-028-937; 062-757-415-379-846; 064-138-810-036-202; 064-330-779-044-975; 071-833-629-169-199; 072-397-415-406-687; 075-131-799-552-130; 077-112-920-752-951; 077-683-363-174-659; 081-144-427-432-971; 082-625-361-618-696; 094-374-698-201-994; 098-052-891-518-284; 099-373-385-765-024; 101-535-958-642-486; 102-165-762-216-574; 105-213-855-144-242; 112-781-611-772-743; 130-075-848-983-316; 130-076-441-971-473; 166-587-691-293-979; 166-708-559-622-171; 170-331-599-622-229; 170-563-722-411-658; 172-499-196-865-981; 179-742-231-200-830; 185-018-664-654-715,0,true,cc-by,gold

Industry 4.0 takes a significant part of everyday life. There is no way. The application of digital life on smart phones, touch screens and smart classrooms may be significant indicators of this. Not just computer information and life but also human-like robotics would take a long time. In the immediate future, you will also see the picture of a modern 5.0 model for manufacturing. Since of emerging technology and increasingly evolving and increasing AI-based approaches, remaining on the top is getting more and more challenging. Robots are much more relevant as now the brain-machine’s technology can be merged with the human mind, as artificial intelligence advances. There are coercive problems in the world economy because efficiency is to be improved without the human workforce being robbed of the manufacturing sector. This paper presents the idea of sustainable business 5.0, where machines are intertwined with the human brain and function as partners rather than rivals, against these obstacles. In addition, the effect of Industry 5.0, which is more likely to create more jobs than to reduce, will be discussed on manufacturing and the economy as a whole.

The transition of mean IPP and mean air leak flow was monitored using DCS, and the association between mean IPP and mean air leak flow was examined. The relationship between the transition of mean IPP and air leakage according to the varying suction pressures on DCS was also investigated. RESULTS Overall, 272 patients (38.1%) showed air leakage after surgery. The mean IPP in patients without air leakage was -12.0 ± 2.9 cmH2O and maintained at about -12 cmH2O constantly, while the mean IPP in patients with air leakage was -8.3 ± 1.9 cmH2O, which changed to -12 cmH2O instantly if air leakage disappeared (P < 0.001). Among patients with air leakage, the mean IPP changed more distinctly in patients with mild suction management than in those with conventional suction management (-5.0 ± 2.6 to -11.5 ± 4.2 and -8.8 ± 1.3 to -12.1 ± 2.5 cmH2O, respectively; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The change in IPP on a DCS is useful for detecting air leakage. Furthermore, management with a mild suction setting on DCS makes it easy to recognize the disappearance of postoperative air leakage.",33,4,580,587,Suction; Intrapleural pressure; Pulmonary air leakage; Lung volume reduction; Lung resection; Air leak; In patient; Suction drainage; Anesthesia; Medicine,Air leakage; Chest drain; Digital drainage system; Intrapleural pressure; Lung resection,Chest Tubes; Humans; Lung; Pneumonectomy/adverse effects; Retrospective Studies; Suction,,,https://academic.oup.com/icvts/article/33/4/580/6277129 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34000044/ https://europepmc.org/article/MED/34000044,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icvts/ivab122,34000044,10.1093/icvts/ivab122,3162630116,PMC8759466,0,003-463-814-108-724; 006-106-274-182-598; 009-404-863-691-205; 011-219-727-444-522; 013-031-424-086-316; 016-983-835-680-464; 023-298-475-348-633; 038-723-497-005-876; 042-400-267-098-649; 046-237-443-557-436; 046-823-799-885-301; 047-422-874-155-851; 048-788-356-363-936; 062-093-777-454-904; 072-753-909-293-537; 088-512-396-805-421; 089-474-119-259-831; 098-785-297-217-882; 107-958-448-738-368; 114-864-663-006-30X; 120-393-310-380-442; 136-958-636-434-11X; 137-648-528-671-233; 179-319-863-093-908,0,true,,

Despite technological support, these pests have caused 20% to 40% production losses, a 50% to 60% deficit in performance, and a cost of between USD 70 million and USD 220 million to the world economies, which forces us to rethink actions centered on people as the key elements to develop appropriate solutions. For this, the present study presents a technological proposal centered on small indigenous coffee producer requirements for introducing Industry 5.0 technologies, considering roadmapping, knowledge management, statistical analysis, and the social, productive, and digital contexts of five localities in Mexico. The results show a correlation between monitoring and control, soil analysis, the creation of organic fertilizers, accompaniment, and coffee experimentation, as the actions to be implemented, proposing the introduction of a mobile application; sensors, virtual platforms, dome-shaped greenhouses, and spectrophotometric technology as relevant technologies centered on indigenous coffee producers' requirements.

We consider this a significant research gap and explore the relationship between smart contracts and sustainability in supply chains. First, we define the concept of smart contracts in terms of supply chain management. Then, we conduct a content analysis of the literature to explore the overlapping research fields of smart contracts and sustainability in supply chains. Next, we develop a semi-structured assessment framework to model the potential environmental and social impacts induced by smart contracts on supply chains. We propose a conceptual framework for supply chain maturity by mapping the relationships between organizational development, sustainability, and technology. We identify smart contracts as a foundational technology that enables efficient and transparent governance and collaborative self-coordination of human and non-human actors. Thus, we argue that smart contracts can contribute to the economic and social development of networked value chains and Society 5.0. To stimulate interdisciplinary research on smart contracts, we conclude the article by formulating research propositions and trade-offs for smart contracts in the context of technology development, business process and supply chain management, and sustainability.",4,,506436,,Supply chain; Organization development; Conceptual framework; Business; Process management; Smart contract; Context (language use); Supply chain management; Sustainability; Business process,,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2021.506436/full http://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2021.506436/full https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/fbloc/fbloc4.html#GroschopfDH21 https://epub.wu.ac.at/8089/ https://doi.org/10.3389/fbloc.2021.506436,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fbloc.2021.506436,,10.3389/fbloc.2021.506436,3154926564,,0,002-760-373-854-303; 004-416-052-037-484; 005-133-122-211-465; 005-149-068-773-171; 005-442-185-401-994; 008-092-872-335-265; 008-278-305-068-012; 009-066-963-038-036; 012-080-295-344-570; 012-750-062-281-425; 013-784-702-186-55X; 013-923-582-078-155; 014-467-672-077-711; 015-324-282-998-230; 015-531-837-288-016; 018-322-889-591-998; 020-130-108-213-00X; 020-397-213-967-527; 021-183-279-286-700; 021-865-565-414-206; 022-304-790-542-067; 024-848-070-339-296; 025-259-885-861-617; 025-778-999-543-267; 026-189-051-696-665; 026-530-804-160-408; 026-628-464-174-197; 026-983-926-488-462; 027-376-885-405-705; 027-869-443-721-335; 030-979-756-376-267; 032-252-070-420-089; 034-286-418-079-36X; 034-412-215-223-24X; 035-746-214-747-064; 036-127-841-632-948; 036-297-026-204-017; 036-652-321-315-178; 037-326-134-917-66X; 039-075-844-619-412; 039-100-266-277-415; 040-043-730-858-780; 041-327-680-949-713; 041-547-266-590-906; 043-155-133-045-314; 044-259-394-287-963; 044-358-512-277-568; 044-585-731-859-189; 044-991-791-983-038; 046-493-695-827-095; 046-802-872-817-901; 049-915-511-575-054; 050-519-023-029-16X; 052-319-259-195-574; 053-260-479-123-700; 053-271-982-274-008; 053-876-046-265-645; 054-077-508-984-835; 054-079-583-763-10X; 054-572-620-974-512; 055-561-946-689-781; 056-755-206-438-17X; 057-942-097-777-139; 062-586-840-502-936; 063-261-496-298-024; 063-437-003-755-191; 063-639-974-825-135; 064-407-541-887-06X; 065-363-646-942-525; 067-115-161-548-060; 067-170-827-399-658; 067-616-890-979-704; 067-774-235-441-514; 069-996-548-469-303; 070-283-742-732-350; 073-531-395-452-205; 074-389-603-385-644; 077-657-517-956-786; 079-928-195-279-966; 085-202-656-022-106; 086-978-455-549-184; 089-107-756-127-167; 090-738-237-848-225; 092-021-938-321-586; 095-928-879-643-060; 097-712-459-825-335; 098-565-104-723-427; 098-591-774-816-71X; 100-033-511-156-987; 100-764-538-512-485; 101-976-491-799-810; 102-885-865-253-365; 104-571-417-535-351; 107-143-108-125-939; 107-729-387-117-533; 109-120-948-156-499; 112-583-169-215-460; 112-938-897-652-028; 113-130-648-142-38X; 113-222-993-713-524; 114-520-598-829-051; 118-180-500-560-806; 122-949-595-576-636; 122-988-702-721-176; 126-734-247-521-134; 130-078-861-337-742; 133-266-480-630-344; 151-110-591-724-29X; 157-522-909-138-24X; 158-104-490-181-904; 158-408-591-447-532; 170-563-722-411-658; 178-643-297-115-591; 179-546-740-291-787,5,true,cc-by,gold

Lopes; Tiago M. Fernández-Caramés,"Internet of Things (IoT) can help to pave the way to the circular economy and to a more sustainable world by enabling the digitalization of many operations and processes, such as water distribution, preventive maintenance, or smart manufacturing. Paradoxically, IoT technologies and paradigms such as edge computing, although they have a huge potential for the digital transition towards sustainability, they are not yet contributing to the sustainable development of the IoT sector itself. In fact, such a sector has a significant carbon footprint due to the use of scarce raw materials and its energy consumption in manufacturing, operating, and recycling processes. To tackle these issues, the Green IoT (G-IoT) paradigm has emerged as a research area to reduce such carbon footprint; however, its sustainable vision collides directly with the advent of Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI), which imposes the consumption of additional energy. This article deals with this problem by exploring the different aspects that impact the design and development of Edge-AI G-IoT systems. Moreover, it presents a practical Industry 5.0 use case that illustrates the different concepts analyzed throughout the article. Specifically, the proposed scenario consists in an Industry 5.0 smart workshop that looks for improving operator safety and operation tracking. Such an application case makes use of a mist computing architecture composed of AI-enabled IoT nodes.

067-843-116-643-056,Method of Choice: A Fluorescent Penetrant Taking into Account Sustainability Criteria,2020-07-21,2020,journal article,Sustainability,20711050,MDPI AG,Switzerland,Andrzej Pacana; Dominika Siwiec; Lucia Bednárová,"To conduct, in an effective way, the non-destructive testing (NDT) of products—in particular, the fluorescent penetrant inspection (FPI)—remains a challenge. Therefore, the aim of this work is to propose the method of support in the choice of a fluorescent penetrant to be used in FPI research. In the results of the usage of the proposed procedure, it is demonstrated that it is possible to reduce the negative impacts on the environment by FPI processes (through sustainability), while including other criteria, i.e., financial, security, productive (Industry 4.0), and societal (Society 5.0) criteria. The essence of the proposed method is to integrate two methods of decision support. These were the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method and the cost–quality analysis (AKJ). Using the AHP method, the quality level of fluorescent penetrant (to the satisfaction of the customer)—which included the sustainability criteria—are calculated. These criteria include natural environment, reactivity, combustibility, level of sensitivity, and type of washing (emulsification). Then, with the help of the AKJ, the most favorable penetrant—in terms of quality and cost—is calculated and, thus, indicated. This choice must include the concept of sustainable development. Therefore, this method can be used to choose fluorescent penetrants in manufacturing and service enterprises which carry out FPI.",12,14,5854,,Production engineering; Decision support system; Risk analysis (engineering); Penetrant (mechanical  electrical  or structural); Industry 4.0; Computer science; Sustainable development; Sustainability; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/14/5854 https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/14/5854/pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jsusta/v12y2020i14p5854-d387384.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12145854,,10.3390/su12145854,3044505455,,0,000-695-363-143-021; 001-842-499-591-863; 001-887-301-897-744; 004-642-342-861-629; 006-594-057-855-368; 011-106-244-334-010; 011-724-273-890-292; 012-451-646-595-321; 013-526-888-036-979; 025-204-020-416-209; 027-524-461-508-120; 028-257-664-690-72X; 039-625-408-739-067; 044-973-839-302-205; 045-958-252-943-055; 048-005-247-699-306; 048-367-322-572-662; 050-174-715-361-031; 051-120-994-778-317; 056-726-706-416-396; 060-448-559-184-720; 061-685-589-759-148; 065-618-957-717-028; 070-434-271-190-238; 072-616-966-045-045; 090-240-669-538-468; 091-160-847-313-218; 092-689-613-642-891; 097-634-746-363-654; 099-739-355-853-289; 101-796-787-904-60X; 103-087-756-682-224; 112-550-601-656-329; 114-153-171-038-419; 114-503-012-687-531; 115-376-146-084-776; 116-593-224-234-432; 116-843-377-466-815; 121-003-531-516-657; 124-054-699-293-927; 124-771-719-128-737; 142-455-787-660-889; 150-522-574-730-342; 151-279-079-872-051; 160-330-254-622-824; 162-535-415-660-234; 169-811-077-960-850; 172-888-793-850-904; 177-457-269-965-665; 194-379-240-058-469,16,true,cc-by,gold

In doing so, a proposed research agenda is made explicit, with the goal of reversing the set of global declining trends in productivity growth, research productivity, and the failure of emergent technologies to contribute to these forms of productivity. The goal of this proposed research agenda is to uncover and predict the source of the next radical increase in productivity, and given its importance, this research agenda is taken to relate to what might be usefully called the 'fifth industrial revolution'.",24,2,197,,Total factor productivity; Economics; Natural resource economics; Productivity; Industrial Revolution,,,,,https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJBIR.2021.112816,http://dx.doi.org/10.1504/ijbir.2021.112816,,10.1504/ijbir.2021.112816,3128740789,,0,,0,false,,

070-609-833-244-587,From Supply Chain 4.0 to Supply Chain 5.0: Findings from a Systematic Literature Review and Research Directions,2021-07-09,2021,journal article,Logistics,23056290,MDPI AG,,Guilherme F. Frederico,"The main purpose of this paper is to present what the Industry 5.0 phenomenon means in the supply chain context. A systematic literature review method was used to get evidence from the current knowledge linked to this theme. The results have evidenced a strong gap related to Industry 5.0 approaches for the supply chain field. Forty-one (41) publications, including conference and journal papers, have been found in the literature. Nineteen (19) words, which were grouped in four (4) clusters, have been identified in the data analysis. This was the basis to form the four (4) constructs of Industry 5.0: Industry Strategy, Innovation and Technologies, Society and Sustainability, and Transition Issues. Then, an alignment with the supply chain context was proposed, being the basis for the incipient Supply Chain 5.0 framework and its research agenda. Industry 5.0 is still in an embryonic and ideal stage. The literature is scarce and many other concepts and discoveries are going to emerge. Although this literature review is based on few available sources, it provides insightful and novel concepts related to Industry 5.0 in the supply chain context. Moreover, it presents a clear set of constructs and a structured research agenda to encourage researchers in deploying further conceptual and empirical works linked to the subject herein explored. Organizations’ leadership, policymakers, and other practitioners involved in supply chains, and mainly those currently working with Industry 4.0 initiatives, can benefit from this research by having clear guidance regarding the dimensions needed to structurally design and implement an Industry 5.0 strategy.

Zanchettin,"Industry 5.0 has laid the necessity to relocate the human at the center of the manufacturing cycle, where everything should be designed to ease his/her work. This implies one to redefine the human-robot collaboration, making it not only safe, but also more inclusive for the operator. Nowadays, this goal is viable thanks to the integration of new sensors in the work cell. Coupled with advanced control strategies, they give the robot a better understanding of both the surrounding environment and the human movement, allowing a more organic cooperation. This paper exploits an RGBD camera and Deep Learning algorithms to retrieve the 3D positions of the manipulated objects in the workspace and to infer the most likely future human destinations in a pick and place case study. Merging this information, a proper control logic is defined and tested in a real robotics application, with the final intent of minimizing human-robot collisions during the collaboration and making the process more reliable and efficient.",,,,,Workspace; Robotics; Computer science; Artificial intelligence; Robot; Process (computing); Exploit; Human–robot interaction; Human–computer interaction; SMT placement equipment; Artificial neural network,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icar53236.2021.9659328,,10.1109/icar53236.2021.9659328,,,0,,0,false,,

Uncertainty management will be particularly important in Industry 5.0 solutions that will require the close integration of operators and technical systems. To prepare for these challenging developments, this work reviews the sources of uncertainty and the scheduling algorithms that deal with the different types of models developed to handle the uncertain nature of the elements and the environment of complex technological systems. The paper not only identifies the challenges, but also the main building blocks that can help to manage and reduce uncertainties based on the I4.0 and I5.0 solutions.

The renewal of a culture of design and business innovation in the area of fashion and textile design is based on the establishment of bridges with different realities that, increasingly dynamic, change the landscape of different products and their creation processes, blurring the boundaries and limits of each area of intervention and its actors. From the small to the big industry we find new needs and professions that project themselves into the future reaching from the past, as in the case of new craft productions that value the identity, artistic and cultural heritage of each geography, supported by new materials and technologies of Industry 5.0. This new dynamic of integrated work, where everyone contributes to enhance the knowledge of each participant, enabling the renewal of knowledge and the development of innovation and social, cultural, and economic inclusion, needs greater support and connection between academia and the creative and productive reality on the ground. The present research group, sustained by the interpretation of the paths of work innovation in the coming decades, intended to provide a contribution to the industry and the culture of national or international design innovation, through research based on the identification of the knowledge and skills necessary for the future training of fashion designers.The adoption of a qualitative and quantitative methodology should allow the collection of data that can indicate trends of needs of future designers and the need to adapt the academy to these new realities. With this study we intend to establish a network of relationships between the different actors in the process of creation and innovation, as well as promote a greater connection between the different forms of creation and production that allow to satisfy the final consumer and their needs around fashion and textiles.</jats:p>",,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.54941/ahfe1001539,,10.54941/ahfe1001539,,,0,,0,false,,

In this initial phase of the Digital Revolution it is essential to affirmthe paradigm of a society, called “Society 5.0”, capable of responding to the challenges of its owntime, balancing economic progress with solutions to social problems. The enabling factor of this paradigmis the Science of Where and the thesis that the Science of Where is the enabling factor of the paradigm thatimplements Society 5.0 is fascinating, but has to be demonstrated. In order to prove this thesis, holistic experimentationis necessary, which involves all the actors present in the theater of society in order to demonstratethe benefits of this philosophy in this field through the exercise of good practices. For this reason,ESRI Italia recently set up a laboratory to conduct experiments at its regional office in Cagliari (Italy). Theexperimentation is scheduled in a project called Sardinia 5.0.

Industry 5.0 has in recent years begun to attract the interest of both practitioners and academics, but this new field can still be considered embryonic and not well documented. Therefore, this study aims to map the field and provide a preliminary picture of the emergence and status of the scientific literature on Industry 5.0. Bibliometric data covering the period from 2015 to 2021 were extracted from the Scopus database. Bibliometric analyses of overall publication volume and growth trajectory, influential documents, authors, sources and countries are performed.

To ensure the continuity and robustness of industrial IoT communications in the case of damaged infrastructure communication facilities postdisaster, the industrial IoT can be connected with satellite networks in emergencies. This article presents a cross-regional, end-to-end, transmission control scheme for satellite-supported, multihop industrial IoT. The proposed scheme adjusts the window of data transmission from two phases, slow start and congestion avoidance, to accommodate the low-transmission performance caused by a long delay and high bit error rate in converged networks. The window of data transmission is also adjusted to increase the amount of data transmission for the slow start to fill the high bandwidth-delay product of the converged network, while adjusting the threshold of data transmission based on feedback information to distinguish different data losses during congestion avoidance. The feasibility of the heterogeneous network transmission model is experimentally verified. The results show that the scheme can achieve good performance in heterogeneous networks of industrial IoT and satellite networks. The scheme is effective in ensuring the continuity and stability of intelligent machine production in Industry 5.0 in emergency communication cases.",18,6,4215,4223,Computer science; Data transmission; Network congestion; Transmission (telecommunications); Robustness (evolution); Computer network; Industrial Internet; Internet of Things; Transmission delay; The Internet; Sliding window protocol; Real-time computing,,,,Scientific Research Fund of Hunan Provincial Education Department; Henan Provincial Science and Technology Research Project; Key project of Guizhou Science and Technology Support Program; Grant Guizhou Key Science and Support,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tii.2021.3133885,,10.1109/tii.2021.3133885,,,0,002-995-208-654-267; 016-172-387-726-764; 025-055-813-171-364; 033-851-018-944-660; 039-842-543-809-516; 044-102-997-080-544; 044-366-463-804-973; 047-735-862-933-748; 048-092-008-205-493; 059-319-856-186-988; 060-317-465-188-456; 063-971-918-509-861; 076-244-665-775-571; 088-325-049-131-406; 113-654-439-988-458; 114-288-848-660-436; 122-479-711-922-142; 125-795-343-058-314; 138-332-915-687-580; 140-109-678-513-738; 142-562-865-970-000; 162-874-234-936-648; 163-822-889-670-299,5,false,,

The history of planning and social partnership, the courses of nationalisation and privatisation and the problem of damaging the state are discussed as well. The author concludes that the crisis has not resulted in the strengthening of the developmental or welfare role of the state, the evolution of a “developmental welfare state” has become less likely in Ireland in the course of crisis management. Another lesson is that the state can manage certain bad assets of the private sector in a way that yields a profit to the public. There are other costs of the crisis management, however, which are to be paid by the people and result in a decrease of state ownership and a shrinking of the welfare systems.",67,4,557,583,Welfare; Private sector; Welfare state; Business; Profit (economics); Social Partnership; State ownership; Developmental state; Crisis management; Market economy,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/148786051 https://akademiai.com/doi/abs/10.1556/032.2017.67.4.4 https://ideas.repec.org/a/aka/aoecon/v67y2017i4p557-583.html https://socionet.ru/publication.xml?h=repec:aka:aoecon:v:67:y:2017:i:4:p:557-583 https://akjournals.com/view/journals/032/67/4/article-p557.xml http://real.mtak.hu/72479/ https://core.ac.uk/download/148786051.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1556/032.2017.67.4.4,,10.1556/032.2017.67.4.4,2782822411,,0,005-733-844-476-958; 006-122-858-695-039; 010-816-918-491-152; 012-342-546-087-108; 025-901-051-424-563; 034-314-066-005-679; 034-758-786-812-409; 087-264-594-276-923; 095-421-061-786-644; 101-227-538-401-374; 112-665-945-547-839; 112-772-534-311-075; 120-155-222-471-711; 139-525-892-777-774; 150-226-661-473-536; 163-142-698-247-827; 175-687-165-971-80X; 196-523-663-093-422,2,true,,green

Along with this system transformation, the declining trend of labor number as world demographical change created demand for higher productivity worker, which is stronger and more versatile for handling more than one working station, giving added value and personalization in fulfilling customer needs. Assistive Technology (AT) which is formerly for disabled or handicapped people, would be more widely used for everyone and working for its new purposes in producing higher individual physical capacity. A common challenge of providing a wearable AT, such as limb prostheses, orthoses, or exoskeletons, is customizing their geometry to fit on user body parts. In Industrial context, this would even be more challenging since it must be provided in massive number which can overburden companies overhead. The disruptive technology of prototyping such as 3D scanning and 3D printing brings a customized prototype into a new level of accomplishment life cycle and affordability. New processing technology and material development in 3D printing eventually transform rapid prototyping into rapid manufacturing of final AT product. This paper aims to examine recent research and development of AT from AT developers and communities as well as its novel development process. The new challenges of new AT existence are discussed further in the context of working safety and product standardization and a study about its impacts towards industrial productivity are highlighted.",2217,1,030076,,Manufacturing engineering; Wearable computer; Personalization; Standardization; Context (language use); Rapid prototyping; Computer science; Process (engineering); Product (business); Added value,,,,,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/5.0000747 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AIPC.2217c0076P/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/5.0000747,,10.1063/5.0000747,3016329028,,0,000-029-747-488-93X; 003-491-882-161-760; 008-358-215-107-17X; 014-195-572-169-671; 014-936-799-072-255; 015-415-118-316-561; 017-171-481-610-946; 017-613-813-411-675; 018-320-786-083-22X; 022-325-921-145-671; 024-346-923-588-084; 024-524-650-441-114; 027-784-899-853-130; 035-401-195-104-659; 044-930-665-736-985; 045-824-573-006-43X; 047-974-872-654-388; 051-313-361-977-800; 051-408-537-160-071; 062-356-885-134-256; 072-454-600-705-767; 073-123-784-675-864; 073-187-559-908-126; 075-102-083-369-039; 075-560-780-377-091; 075-742-629-719-738; 077-725-458-611-893; 080-208-663-986-101; 086-884-917-693-643; 088-866-180-432-302; 096-181-218-719-121; 114-669-068-559-504; 126-742-751-222-184; 147-454-381-227-37X; 165-373-601-564-326; 185-124-562-126-312,2,false,,

Meanwhile, considering the big modeling gap between the model world and the physical world, the concept of parallel intelligence is introduced. With the help of software-defined everything, parallel intelligence bridges the big modeling gap by means of constructing artificial systems where computational experiments can be implemented to verify social policies, economic strategies, and even military operations. Artificial systems play the role of “social laboratories” in which decisions are computed before they are executed in our physical society. Afterwards, decisions with the expected outputs are executed in parallel in both the artificial and physical systems to interactively sense, compute, evaluate and adjust system behaviors in real-time, leading system behaviors in the physical system converging to those proven to be optimal in the artificial ones. Thus, the smart guidance and management for our society can be achieved.",1,4,377,393,Physical system; Artificial architecture; Variety (cybernetics); Structure (mathematical logic); Data science; Artificial systems; Computer science; Marketing and artificial intelligence; Management science; Social computing; Big data,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S246823221630083X https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/691657 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S246823221630083X https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/caaitrit/caaitrit1.html#WangLYYW16,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trit.2016.11.005,,10.1016/j.trit.2016.11.005,2557083469,,0,000-435-968-467-60X; 000-676-734-984-601; 001-455-111-089-149; 002-093-112-637-179; 009-572-934-998-048; 011-005-481-512-172; 011-951-610-024-935; 013-284-224-518-159; 018-105-227-196-074; 020-954-690-005-08X; 031-210-685-723-279; 036-126-294-106-038; 038-786-049-532-347; 042-418-171-073-063; 044-502-457-821-447; 046-531-560-430-044; 046-854-916-560-533; 052-725-906-757-937; 052-760-723-676-556; 054-972-485-451-040; 064-944-657-442-728; 065-232-234-452-407; 067-119-140-939-538; 067-464-969-584-318; 072-779-621-223-025; 073-398-129-300-567; 074-225-102-766-675; 080-900-508-502-921; 083-197-057-555-879; 090-072-238-492-509; 090-285-013-664-014; 093-530-739-304-785; 094-395-606-528-088; 105-008-870-501-217; 107-901-280-537-011; 113-668-755-447-474; 115-799-940-759-309; 118-094-093-799-949; 123-425-685-768-534; 129-249-060-368-109; 129-448-470-942-101; 135-733-642-631-992; 159-784-801-335-279; 175-987-822-370-882; 180-047-507-701-427; 187-687-787-548-825,34,true,"CC BY, CC BY-ND, CC BY-NC, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

Kata kunci: genetik; Indonesia; keragaman; informasi; teknologi ABSTRACT Indonesia stores abundant genetik resources but has weaknesses in its database. This becomes a gap in the biopiracy of the pharmaceutical companies in developed countries. The development of information technology entered the era of technology 4.0 and society 5.0. Legal protection of genetik resources in terms of regulation and institutions as well as optimization of information technology in non-juridical protection. The research method used is juridical normative with descriptive analysis approach. Data was collected through literature study and interviews and analyzed using qualitative juridical methods. Indonesia does not yet have specific rules regarding genetik resources. The Convention on Biological Diversity, the Cartagena Protocol and the Nagoya Protocol are not yet optimal because they are not supported by developed countries that apply double standards. The development of information technology is both an opportunity and a challenge. Information technology can be a means of compiling a database of abundant and diverse genetik resources. The use of information technology is absolutely necessary and can be a means of proving electronically and efforts to prevent claims from other countries.

In this paper, we focus on a specific problem in social media mining which is to extract traffic relevant microblogs from Sina Weibo, a Chinese microblogging platform. It is transformed into a machine learning problem of short text classification. First, we apply the continuous bag-of-word model to learn word embedding representations based on a data set of three billion microblogs. Compared to the traditional one-hot vector representation of words, word embedding can capture semantic similarity between words and has been proved effective in natural language processing tasks. Next, we propose using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) models and their combination LSTM-CNN to extract traffic relevant microblogs with the learned word embeddings as inputs. We compare the proposed methods with competitive approaches, including the support vector machine (SVM) model based on a bag of n-gram features, the SVM model based on word vector features, and the multi-layer perceptron model based on word vector features. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed deep learning approaches.",20,8,3049,3058,Deep learning; Support vector machine; Semantic similarity; Artificial intelligence; Natural language processing; Word embedding; Social media mining; Computer science; Perceptron; Word (computer architecture); Convolutional neural network,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China,http://ir.ia.ac.cn/handle/173211/25773?mode=full&submit_simple=Show+full+item+record https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/tits/tits20.html#ChenLWLW19 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8527675 https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2018.2871269 https://core.ac.uk/download/225126628.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tits.2018.2871269,,10.1109/tits.2018.2871269,2899676184,,0,000-386-850-931-210; 001-422-612-792-560; 002-044-611-571-505; 002-093-112-637-179; 002-271-069-270-197; 005-158-961-797-306; 009-792-945-945-632; 012-290-883-198-157; 012-549-392-613-563; 015-011-888-895-810; 020-298-001-549-194; 021-187-280-173-832; 028-418-141-802-416; 037-814-300-135-093; 042-155-483-647-677; 046-081-756-641-964; 050-739-246-123-502; 054-387-812-458-163; 054-913-281-689-786; 057-040-097-643-496; 061-681-098-073-91X; 063-561-325-860-443; 073-295-547-440-667; 073-759-677-927-53X; 075-094-252-767-525; 084-638-260-152-466; 086-258-967-025-40X; 090-444-625-880-493; 104-512-929-235-758; 111-772-004-704-537; 112-684-249-231-287; 115-639-266-229-142; 115-799-940-759-309; 115-938-570-285-835; 118-263-694-150-648; 120-434-038-158-92X; 129-426-320-096-934; 137-588-638-814-408; 142-474-806-225-780; 143-696-434-561-168; 145-644-224-329-721; 162-956-287-027-308; 167-794-241-386-770; 168-020-907-977-727; 169-427-843-343-311; 170-466-324-438-850; 176-600-765-206-425; 178-312-289-474-563; 190-742-083-393-172; 193-163-053-357-798; 196-441-056-369-328,47,true,,green

In the study, digital twins are used as a basis in predictive analytics systems. The comparison of the current measurement information coming from the sensors with the results calculated in the digital twins of the equipment units provides identification of the current technical condition. In this chapter, we consider one of the possible approaches to implementing the architecture of a software product for building a digital model of a thermal power plant thermal circuit—the allocation of layers. It describes the advantages and disadvantages of this method in designing, changing the source program code, and correcting the internal structure of software—refactoring. The main advantage of the method is scalability since thermal circuits can contain a large number of pieces of equipment. A three-level architectural solution of the digital twin construction subsystem has been developed. A fragment of a database accumulating the required data for obtaining calculated data using a digital double of the thermal circuit of a power plant is presented. It also shows the implementation of one of the abstract layers of the architecture—the database management system layer. The obtained results allow us to assert the effectiveness of the layers method application for use as part of predictive analytics systems using the concept of the main and auxiliary equipment digital twins of energy facilities.KeywordsDigital twinSoftwareDatabaseModelingTPP equipmentLife cycle",,,239,249,Scalability; Computer science; Software; Analytics; Digital electronics,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-95112-2_20,,10.1007/978-3-030-95112-2_20,,,0,003-776-239-055-060; 008-324-232-240-137; 021-380-069-198-465; 027-904-325-809-089; 047-907-637-718-02X; 050-154-802-385-527; 055-165-270-740-692; 085-548-271-255-062; 109-963-395-691-437,0,false,,

While the literature has introduced Industry 4.0 technologies, the reality in the food industry especially halal related product shows disparity in the contribution of scholars to real-world issue. The disparity between both literature and industry is due to information integration. The issue related to information integration can be solved through Society 5.0 where human and technology are connected through information management, monitoring, and control. Nevertheless, studies related to Society 5.0 are limited and isolated to social and technology area since the concept is still new in the literature. However, the advantages of integrating Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0 are able in ensuring integrity in food supply chain especially related to halal. Thus, the objective of this paper is to propose a model based on Society 5.0 to provide solution to food integrity in the supply chain. This study has undertaken extensive literature review related to Society 5.0 and integrity practices. The outcome of the paper proposed a model that links Society 5.0 and Industry 4.0 technologies to help organisation manage halal food in the supply chain with integrity as its measurements. The model proposed in this study is useful for any organisation to adopt halal supply chain and understand how to implement Industry 4.0 as well as managing information through Society 5.0.",4,2,103,114,Supply chain; Risk analysis (engineering); Information management; Business; Control (management); Industry 4.0; Halal food; Information integration; Product (business); Food industry,,,,,https://journal.ump.edu.my/jgi/article/download/5948/1366 https://journal.ump.edu.my/jgi/article/view/5948,http://dx.doi.org/10.15282/jgi.4.2.2021.5948,,10.15282/jgi.4.2.2021.5948,3168384511,,0,,2,true,cc-by,hybrid

Society 5.0 offers a human-centered society that makes a balance between economic progress and the resolution of social problems through a system that is highly connected through cyberspace and the real world. If society 4.0 allows anyone to access also share information on the internet. Society 5.0 is an era where all technology is part of humanity itself. To take advantage of opportunities and answer the challenges of the industrial revolution 4.0, Indonesian people in particular are required to have data, technology and human literacy capabilities. Data literacy is needed by HR to improve skills in processing and analyzing big data for the benefit of improving public and business services. Technology literacy shows the ability to utilize digital technology to process data and information, while human literacy must be mastered because it shows the element of soft skills or the development of individual character to be able to collaborate, be adaptive, and innovative. Indonesia is demanded to be able to follow industry 4.0 workflows juxtaposed with society 5.0. The need for human resources in several business fields is still very massive if all of them are carried out by robotics. Indonesia is a developing country with a fairly dense population that is certainly able to align between the needs of industry 4.0 and society 5.0.

Next, it focuses on business, which needs to evolve towards industry 4.0. For this, the chapter analyzes the decline of industry, which encouraged the leap towards industry 4.0. Then, it argues that society 5.0 might belong to a new industrial religion, an industry whose symbol might be the absence of a symbolic place, but also that of production carried out closer to the consumer. Different business theorists have defined fundamental structures of the firm. These structures can be challenged by the arrival of society 5.0 only if information flows or the exchange of data are inefficient. The chapter explores all these structures.

A. Arens; N. A. Katkova; E. A. Khalimon; I. S. Brikoshina,"<jats:p>A comprehensive study of the phenomenon of the fifth industrial revolution is carried out. This topic is relevant due to the rapid development of biotechnologies and neural networks, transforming the environment of industries and society as a whole. Various interpretations of the term “fifth industrial revolution” are considered, and the key characteristics of previous industrial revolutions are identified and analysed. The main content of the research paper is an analysis of the scientific literature, consideration of visions of the fifth industrial revolution, as well as the identification of the main opportunities and threats that manufacturing enterprises, industries and society as a whole will face. The impact of Industry 5.0 on the economic performance of industries while meeting the needs and interests of employees, as well as ensuring environmental sustainability and resource conservation is described. The importance of the readiness of future industries to adapt to changing conditions in key value chains is emphasized. Based on the analysis of the scientific literature, the authors have revealed that the fifth industrial revolution will be determined by a new and expanded purposefulness, consisting of three basic elements: human orientation, stability and sustainability. Finally, the importance of balancing production through the development of sustainable strategic value chains, adaptable production capacities and flexible business processes was emphasized.<jats:bold> </jats:bold></jats:p>",4,3,11,19,Engineering; Field (Bourdieu); Artificial neural network; Industrial Revolution; Telecommunications,,,,,https://doaj.org/article/f90a27cc9d2745f884b1298afbacbc34,http://dx.doi.org/10.26425/2658-3445-2021-4-3-11-19,,10.26425/2658-3445-2021-4-3-11-19,3212582827,,0,008-271-422-618-915; 034-994-420-807-263; 060-894-886-691-324; 063-576-592-441-480; 103-703-217-065-848,1,true,cc-by,gold

The government's policy is to carry out all activities at home, in order to cut the chain of the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, which is a tough test for music educators. These changes occur because of the community's efforts to adapt to new needs, conditions, and conditions that arise in line with the growth of society. Not finished with the issue of the Industrial Revolution 4.0, now people are faced with back with the issue of society 5.0, objects and all existing social orders integrated with the virtual world. The purpose of this research to determine continuity of music education during the Covid-19 pandemic in the era of the Society 5.0. The method used is literature review, namely using various sources of reference both from research results and from the thoughts of other authors. The results of this conceptual research are expected to provide local wisdom values because music is one of the important elements for society in facing a changing era.",4,1,321,331,Music education; Government; Political science; Order (exchange); Test (assessment); Field (Bourdieu); Public relations; Process (engineering); Industrial Revolution; Pandemic,,,,,http://ejournal.aibpm.org/index.php/JICP/article/view/1159/1059 http://ejournal.aibpm.org/index.php/JICP/article/download/1159/1059,http://dx.doi.org/10.32535/jicp.v4i1.1159,,10.32535/jicp.v4i1.1159,3183658040,,0,,0,true,cc-by-nc-sa,gold

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is central to this change and offers major opportunities to improve our lives. The recent developments in AI are the result of increased processing power, improvements in algorithms and the exponential growth in the volume and variety of digital data. Many applications of AI have started entering into our every-day lives, from machine translations, to image recognition, and music generation, and are increasingly deployed in industry, government, and commerce. Connected and autonomous vehicles, and AI-supported medical diagnostics are areas of application that will soon be commonplace. There is strong global competition on AI among the US, China, and Europe. The US leads for now but China is catching up fast and aims to lead by 2030. For the EU, it is not so much a question of winning or losing a race but of finding the way of embracing the opportunities offered by AI in a way that is human-centred, ethical, secure, and true to our core values. The EU Member States and the European Commission are developing coordinated national and European strategies, recognising that only together we can succeed. We can build on our areas of strength including excellent research, leadership in some industrial sectors like automotive and robotics, a solid legal and regulatory framework, and very rich cultural diversity also at regional and sub-regional levels. It is generally recognised that AI can flourish only if supported by a robust computing infrastructure and good quality data: • With respect to computing, we identified a window of opportunity for Europe to invest in the emerging new paradigm of computing distributed towards the edges of the network, in addition to centralised facilities. This will support also the future deployment of 5G and the Internet of Things. • With respect to data, we argue in favour of learning from successful Internet companies, opening access to data and developing interactivity with the users rather than just broadcasting data. In this way, we can develop ecosystems of public administrations, firms, and civil society enriching the data to make it fit for AI applications responding to European needs. We should embrace the opportunities afforded by AI but not uncritically. The black box characteristics of most leading AI techniques make them opaque even to specialists. AI systems are currently limited to narrow and well-defined tasks, and their technologies inherit imperfections from their human creators, such as the well-recognised bias effect present in data. We should challenge the shortcomings of AI and work towards strong evaluation strategies, transparent and reliable systems, and good human-AI interactions. Ethical and secure-by-design algorithms are crucial to build trust in this disruptive technology, but we also need a broader engagement of civil society on the values to be embedded in AI and the directions for future development. This social engagement should be part of the effort to strengthen our resilience at all levels from local, to national and European, across institutions, industry and civil society. Developing local ecosystems of skills, computing, data, and applications can foster the engagement of local communities, respond to their needs, harness local creativity and knowledge, and build a human-centred, diverse, and socially driven AI. We still know very little about how AI will impact the way we think, make decisions, relate to each other, and how it will affect our jobs. This uncertainty can be a source of concern but is also a sign of opportunity. The future is not yet written. We can shape it based on our collective vision of what future we would like to have. But we need to act together and act fast.",,,,,The Internet; Variety (cybernetics); Psychological resilience; Business; Interactivity; Government; Artificial intelligence; Applications of artificial intelligence; Civil society; Social engagement,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:ipt:iptwpa:jrc113826 https://ideas.repec.org/p/ipt/iptwpa/jrc113826.html https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC113826 https://core.ac.uk/download/162257245.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2760/11251,,10.2760/11251,2908425202,,0,,38,true,,green

The new Industry 5.0 has a positive impact on the performance of the logistics. Logistics information system is a root of supply chain to collect the information related to products and track the information and services related to the products in a supply chain manner. A sound logistics information system can lead to cost reduction and can also improve customer satisfaction. However, research on IoT adoption in logistics is acceptance of IoT into supply chain services in specific has been rhetoric. IoT creates far-reaching payoffs for all the operations of logistics among the suppliers and customers. This benefit extends across the entire logistics information system, including inventory, transportation, and delivery system with better efficiency, security, and safety.

Excell; Richard Picking,"The current statuses and future promises of the Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Everything (IoE) and Internet of Nano-Things (IoNT) are extensively reviewed and a summarized survey is presented. The analysis clearly distinguishes between IoT and IoE, which are wrongly considered to be the same by many commentators. After evaluating the current trends of advancement in the fields of IoT, IoE and IoNT, this paper identifies the 21 most significant current and future challenges as well as scenarios for the possible future expansion of their applications. Despite possible negative aspects of these developments, there are grounds for general optimism about the coming technologies. Certainly, many tedious tasks can be taken over by IoT devices. However, the dangers of criminal and other nefarious activities, plus those of hardware and software errors, pose major challenges that are a priority for further research.

Although industry 5.0 can revolutionize the landscape of goods production, still its adoption is in the infancy stage. Hence, the purpose of this article is to examine barriers that impede the adoption of industry 5.0, and to propose solution initiatives (SIs). After an in-depth literature review and interviews with German industry experts in pharmaceutical sector, barriers and SIs are ranked using an integrated Analytical hierarchy process-elimination and choice expressing reality-decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (AHP-ELECTRE-DEMATEL) approach. “Linking virtual reality and reality” is found to be the most critical deterrent to the adoption of industry 5.0, and falls into a causal group, which signifies their influence on other deterrents. “Measures for better connectivity with patients” is of utmost importance for German firms to ensure secure communication and safeguard patient data. The findings also highlight the problems with the adoption of high-tech innovations due to lack of standardization and fair benchmarking policies on industry 5.0. This article concludes by proposing an industry 5.0 framework. The inhibitors to adopting industry 5.0 were investigated in this article, the results of which will assist practitioners and decision makers to understand the issues with industry 5.0.

F. Moller; Hamid Vakilzadian; Roland E. Haas,"In the past, manufacturing equipment was instrumented hard-wired. Industrial equipment such as sensors, controllers, and others are expensive, and upgrading manufacturing equipment in existing facilities is costly. The growing use of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven cost reductions in sensors, controllers, and communications through high volumes of digital devices and value-added components. The manufacturing sector with its massive installed base of legacy equipment has also become an area of interest for the advances in innovative digital technologies. Meanwhile, the next level of innovation in manufacturing has been achieved, labeled by the term 4th Industrial Revolution, in short Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 takes the automation of manufacturing processes to a new level by introducing customized and intelligent production technologies. Machines are connected and communicate with each other to ultimately make decisions, operate independently, or cooperate with humans in a customer-oriented production environment. This raises the question about the key issues of the next industrial enhancement and the term to call it? The change from Industry 4.0 to the next innovative industrial enhancement is termed Industry 5.0. However, Industry 5.0 has its root in the concept of Industry 4.0. Thus, the key issues of the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 can be seen in the goal of making manufacturability sustainable from economic, ecologic and societal perspectives. This requires building a circular economy with a focus on a human centric industry.

This paper explores how data-driven decision-making (DDDM) can enable sustainable and resilient supply chain operations within the manufacturing industry. A series of in-depth interviews were conducted with experts, researchers, and company representatives across the manufacturing industry and universities in Sweden. The findings show a consensus among companies, researchers, and literature about the potential of data utilization for sustainability purposes; however, in most cases, the complete transformation towards data-driven has not happened yet. Companies have uncertainty about what data is needed rather than its lack. Reliability &amp; validity of data become essential to exploit the potential of the data organizations already possess. Based on the literature and interview data, a conceptual model is proposed, including three identified parameters connected to DDDM, 1) data and IT infrastructure, 2) current operations, and 3) an improved triple bottom line performance. The model captures the interconnections between such parameters, depicting the benefits and challenges of DDDM and its relation to more sustainable and resilient supply chain operations within the manufacturing industry.

Ng,"• A real assembly line balancing problem with human-robot collaboration is studied. • A new MILP model is proposed for the problem. • An adaptive SA algorithm is proposed with customized characteristics. • The SA’s performance is validated in real-world cases from the automotive industry. In light of the Industry 5.0 trend towards human-centric and resilient industries, human-robot collaboration (HRC) assembly lines can be used to enhance productivity and workers’ well-being, provided that the optimal allocation of tasks and available resources can be determined. This study investigates the assembly line balancing problem (ALBP), considering HRC. This problem, abbreviated ALBP-HRC, arises in advanced manufacturing systems, where humans and collaborative robots share the same workplace and can simultaneously perform tasks in parallel or in collaboration. Driven by the need to solve the more complex assembly line-balancing problems found in the automotive industry, this study aims to address the ALBP-HRC with the cycle time and the number of operators (humans and robots) as the primary and secondary objective, respectively. In addition to the traditional ALBP constraints, the human and robot characteristics, in terms of task times, allowing multiple humans and robots at stations, and their joint/collaborative tasks are formulated into a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. A neighborhood-search simulated annealing (SA) is proposed with customized solution representation and neighborhood search operators designed to fit into the problem characteristics. Furthermore, the proposed SA features an adaptive neighborhood selection mechanism that enables the SA to utilize its exploration history to dynamically choose appropriate neighborhood operators as the search evolves. The proposed MILP and SA are implemented on real cases taken from the automotive industry where stations are designed for HRC. The computational results over different problems show that the adaptive SA produces promising solutions compared to the MILP and other swarm intelligence algorithms, namely genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and artificial bee colony. The comparisons of human/robot versus HRC settings in the case study indicate significant improvement in the productivity of the assembly line when multiple humans and robots with collaborative tasks are permissible at stations.",140,,105674,105674,Automotive industry; Robot; Computer science; Scheduling (production processes); Assembly line; Simulated annealing; Integer programming; Job shop scheduling; Task (project management); Linear programming; Distributed computing; Mathematical optimization,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2021.105674,,10.1016/j.cor.2021.105674,,,0,010-979-271-512-130; 015-367-986-031-722; 024-216-245-257-511; 027-856-581-580-38X; 030-566-679-640-830; 031-964-765-251-399; 036-012-008-162-747; 038-024-031-051-894; 039-773-190-077-869; 049-816-999-056-296; 058-988-530-350-110; 059-514-085-671-822; 059-739-775-031-555; 092-214-794-270-804; 099-747-298-582-08X; 110-432-942-745-346; 128-275-436-645-171; 150-106-755-118-790,7,true,cc-by,hybrid

Huang,"Benefiting from the marriage of just-in-time (JIT) and computer integrated manufacturing (CIM), a series of manufacturing planning and control (MPC) systems has been introduced for contemporary production and operations management. However, the increasing requirements for customized and personalized products and services, together with the acceleration of the socio-economic environment in the age of Industry 4.0, forced manufacturers to re-evaluate their current MPC strategies that mainly emphasize time, cost and quality priorities. Industry 4.0 presents a solid ambition for transforming to a digital, data-driven and interconnected manufacturing industry centred around cyber-physical convergence. Although the relevance of Industry 4.0 technologies’ disruptions on operations management has been acknowledged, a significant gap in the evolution of the logic and design of MPC systems has been observed. The requirements of on-demand products and services with enhanced flexibility, resilience, sustainability and humanitarianism in this new industrial revolution call for innovations of MPC architectures and approaches. This paper first summarizes the evolution of MPC systems with enabling technologies and the changing business climate at that time. To explore innovative MPC that complies with the increasing economic, social and environmental requirements, the concept of synchronization-oriented MPC with four principles is proposed. Following the principles, a general framework for the synchronization-oriented MPC with enhanced economic, social and environmental benefits is developed. This work potentially provides insights into innovative MPC in the age of Industry 4.0 and even Industry 5.0.",55,2,163,168,Flexibility (engineering); Industry 4.0; Synchronization (alternating current); Sustainability; Quality (philosophy); Computer science; Business; Risk analysis (engineering),,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2022.04.187,,10.1016/j.ifacol.2022.04.187,,,0,001-011-892-665-374; 001-103-459-836-919; 001-758-579-687-388; 009-980-090-585-966; 012-218-887-216-344; 013-209-041-019-592; 014-796-353-623-217; 020-627-235-778-998; 036-379-622-440-373; 038-905-048-579-484; 044-826-117-182-379; 045-936-475-493-242; 054-566-657-836-198; 055-185-113-498-458; 057-335-032-266-130; 059-424-427-267-469; 064-138-810-036-202; 082-140-051-993-161; 085-056-385-382-296; 095-366-405-250-466; 102-087-824-667-717; 114-257-960-475-300; 121-189-721-254-131; 126-126-765-625-33X; 129-461-000-946-008,2,true,,gold

It is actually significant that the global system involves a multidimensional and technology-driven structure and that national-states’ regulations occur along with transnational practices. In this system, new technologies have a big role. New technologies consist of some innovations such as artificial intelligence, robotics, big data, internet of things, cloud technology, and so on, that describe the concept of ‘Society 5.0’ proposed by Japan and the concept of ‘Industry 4.0’ proposed by Germany. These technologies create super smart society in terms of their impacts on improving human life. Smart technologies improve human life in the fields of education, health, security, etc. On the other hand, smart technologies used in the process of production shape the global production network and the innovative strategies of firms. It is required that new technologies should not be remained uncontrolled within the logic of ‘laissez faire’ because their impacts and power are so great. Thus, national-states should make efficient economic policies by also considering transnational practices; like that Japan and Germany develop their own national view in terms of Society 5.0 and Industry 4.0. Such fields come into prominence in the economic policies in respect of new technologies: Competition policy on the basis of global competition and innovativeness—Industrialization policy on the basis of emerging industries of new technologies—Intellectual property policy on the basis of the rights of people and firms producing knowledge and innovation—Employment policy on the basis of new occupations and specialities in the global age—Social policy on the basis of new technologies’ control on individual and social life.",,,139,163,Economic policy; Business; Laissez-faire; Emerging technologies; Control (management); Production (economics); Competition (economics); Process (engineering); Big data; Cloud computing,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-33-6811-8_8 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-33-6811-8_8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-33-6811-8_8,,10.1007/978-981-33-6811-8_8,3160004077,,0,015-666-815-227-966; 017-415-713-662-955; 049-816-999-056-296; 054-052-045-969-194; 162-717-451-214-458; 175-386-977-279-510,0,false,,

These solutions are commonly built on digital twins, i.e., comprehensive, structured and effective digital representations of the production system and its entities, whose current status is constantly updated by the plugged data sources. The arising of the Industry 5.0 paradigm and the established key role of workers in manufacturing require new Digital Twins to represent also humans. In fact, as cognitive automation becomes more and more pervasive and its behaviour unintelligible to humans, it becomes essential for improving performance and well-being, at the same time, to model humans as data-driven agents and to represent their interaction with the factory systems. Currently, a standardised solution for creating Digital Twins is missing, forcing industrial solution architects to resort to ad-hoc implementations and models. These solutions lack re-usability, scalability and extensibility, preventing the introduction of a human digital representation in existent twins, so hindering the complete shift to the new Industry 5.0 paradigm. In this paper, such limitations are faced by introducing an extensible and flexible IIoT-industrial internet of things-based platform with a twofold benefit: on the one hand, to support the creation of customised data representations of production systems and their entities including humans; on the other hand, to provide a modular infrastructure, along with its interchangeable components, for easy digital twin instantiation and ramp-up. An implementation of the platform has been tested with different applications in a laboratory setting and released as a public resource. Finally, potential future applications of the proposed digital twin are discussed, highlighting its main benefits.",107,,661,667,Computer science; Implementation; Modular design; Scalability; Factory (object-oriented programming); Industry 4.0; Context (archaeology); Automation; Usability; USable; Data science; Software engineering; Distributed computing,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2022.05.042,,10.1016/j.procir.2022.05.042,,,0,002-599-460-164-388; 006-824-466-671-376; 009-196-394-593-472; 009-683-959-159-971; 012-302-514-956-35X; 013-007-720-642-102; 015-228-799-602-614; 017-415-713-662-955; 019-768-331-540-502; 028-466-048-018-180; 047-436-453-460-898; 068-775-721-617-07X; 083-138-344-350-817; 085-466-022-073-007; 094-019-771-819-795; 096-017-941-794-37X; 117-587-846-748-601; 127-046-613-305-747; 129-461-404-099-044; 131-206-117-846-231,0,true,,gold

In this study, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) integrated Project Oriented Problem Based Learning (POPBL) learning models were implemented to improve the mastery of science concepts of junior high school students, especially on the topic of Environmental Pollution. The method used was a mixed-method. The STEM integrated STB learning model design framework consists of 3 stages: Onset Stage, Execution Stage, and Closure Stage. The concept of students is emphasized at the onset stage in the case study dissemination phase. In this phase, students analyze problems based on articles provided by the teacher. The more understanding the material, the more critical students will explore existing issues and find logical solutions to those problems. The results showed that there was a difference between the average pretest and posttest learning outcomes (t=-5,660; df = 53; Sig. (2-tailed) = 0,000). This indicates an increase in junior high school students' science concepts mastery after using the STEM integrated POPBL Learning Model. Improving students' mastery of concepts using a STEM integrated POPBL learning model is still in the low category with n-gain = 0.17.

Working with our industry partner towards this example application, we evaluated our AR interface design for shared physical workspace collaboration in human-robot teams. We conducted a multi-dimensional analysis of our interface using established metrics. Results from our user study (n = 26) show that, subjectively, the AR interface feels more novel and a standard joystick interface feels more dependable to users. However, the AR interface was found to reduce physical demand and task completion time, while increasing robot utilization. Furthermore, user’s freedom of choice to collaborate with the robot may also affect the perceived usability of the system.</jats:p>",11,3,1,19,Human–computer interaction; Joystick; Workspace; Human–robot interaction; Robot; Augmented reality; Interface (matter); Computer science; Task (project management); Teleoperation; User interface; Usability,,,,Australian Research Council Discovery Projects,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3524082,,10.1145/3524082,,,0,000-328-956-320-893; 016-606-401-900-323; 019-649-365-862-655; 022-153-122-016-218; 022-797-732-038-303; 023-858-106-556-210; 024-452-643-319-954; 032-476-772-428-934; 038-481-002-078-338; 039-773-771-745-183; 050-796-611-317-286; 054-171-501-991-275; 054-898-056-000-644; 055-235-254-811-244; 062-008-715-538-345; 062-613-457-585-899; 067-638-922-109-648; 068-706-278-451-650; 071-647-526-745-553; 078-068-292-155-89X; 086-089-951-563-364; 090-679-371-289-21X; 098-303-924-934-297; 113-480-737-748-164; 116-553-423-893-485; 123-090-986-208-993; 165-865-286-843-261; 184-567-316-239-318,0,true,,bronze

Furthermore, the cost of solar panels and LED lamps have also dropped dramatically in recent years and these also allow for improved energy support in regions that lack energy access or require autonomous monitoring/processing. Also, low-cost 3D printers are now widely available for making simple prototypes of hardware. Finally, low-cost educational software tools have also become available. Combining these technologies enables engineering education to be brought into traditionally inaccessible communities in the world. In this book chapter, examples of how ICT and energy technologies are being used to teach students engineering technologies in underserved communities will be described.

Interfaces to digital twins are projected to go beyond physical representations to become blueprints for the actual “objects” and an active dashboard for their control. The role and importance of real-time interactive animations presented in an Extended Reality (XR) format will be explored. The need for using game engines, particularly their physics engines and AI within interactive simulated Extended Reality is expanded on. Importing and scanning real-world environments is assumed to become more efficient when using AR. Exporting to VR and AR is recommended to be a default feature. A technology framework for the next generation simulators is presented along with a proposed set of implementation guidelines. The need for more human centric technology approaches, nascent in Industry 4.0, are now central to the emerging Industry 5.0 paradigm; an agenda that is discussed in this research as part of a human in the loop future, supported by DES. The potential role of Explainable Artificial Intelligence is also explored along with an audit trail approach to provide a justification of complex and automated decision-making systems with relation to DES.

The education sector completely adopted the remote teaching concept thereby connecting educators and students through technology. The present study aims at understanding that how Education 4.0 has helped in creating an intelligent learning space aligned with disruptive technologies for developing and enhancing education with learners at the center and further how this has facilitated remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic. For the purpose of study, secondary sources of data including research papers and news articles based on the similar themes were referred. Education 4.0 has completely transformed the way the education sector functions by putting the learner at the center and making the entire process student-centric where the learner will decide what they want to study rather than putting a predefined syllabus in front of them. The intelligent learning space is created through the application of emerging technologies. </jats:p>",,,213,229,Psychology; Space (commercial competition); Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Multimedia; Pandemic,,,,,https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/creating-the-intelligent-learning-space/289191,http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/978-1-7998-6878-1.ch011,,10.4018/978-1-7998-6878-1.ch011,3199754176,,0,002-316-651-734-862; 003-281-253-938-13X; 008-241-677-087-59X; 014-620-748-809-287; 030-211-041-911-950; 046-797-992-954-35X; 071-303-810-655-986,1,false,,

We are also developing light-sources that generate spectral signals from micro-samples introduced (for compatibility reasons) into micro-plasmas. Our battery- operated microplasmas are coupled to a portable, fiber-optic spectrometer and this combination (or system) can be thought of as a ""multi parameter"" or ""multi-element sensor"" for the UV and the Vis parts of the spectrum. Initially, our Micro Plasma Devices (MPDs) were fabricated using technologies borrowed from the semiconductor industry (e.g., microfluidics, micromachining) [1] . To reduce fabrication costs and to enable rapid prototyping [2] , we fabricated Micro Plasma Devices using 3D-printing of polymeric materials [3] . We also fabricated (and continue to characterize) a relatively- inexpensive self-powered detector on a flexible polymeric substrate [4] . The detector responds to light from the visible part of the spectrum. To enable portability for chemical measurements on-site (i.e., in the field) we often used a smartphone for data acquisition and signal processing, thus enabling a sensor-system to be placed on the Internet of Things (IoT) and potentially, to be employed in Society 5.0 applications [5] . To further facilitate use on-site (i.e., in the field), portable optical spectrometers with a short focal length must be used. But as focal length decreases, spectral overlaps (often called spectral interference effects) arise. To address them, we employed Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Deep Learning approaches, thus (in many respects) making sensor-systems smarter [6] .

110-325-159-524-628,Advanced Composites with Aluminum Alloys Matrix and Their Fabrication Processes,2021-10-06,2021,book chapter,Advanced Aluminium Composites and Alloys,,IntechOpen,,Leszek A. Dobrzański,"<jats:p>This chapter introduces advanced aluminum alloy matrix composites and their manufacturing processes. In the beginning, the state of the art is characterized and the general characteristics of aluminum and its practical applications are presented, starting with the history of aluminum. The current approximate distribution of bauxite resources in the world and the production of bauxite and alumina in the leading countries of the world, as well as the production of primary and secondary aluminum and the range of aluminum end products, are presented. Aluminum alloys intended for plastic deformation and castings, and composite materials in general and with a matrix of aluminum alloys in particular, have been characterized in general. Against this background, a detailed review of the results of the Author’s own research included in numerous projects and own publications on advanced composite materials, their production technology, their structure, and properties were done. The range of aluminum alloy matrices of composite materials was adequately characterized, which include AlSi12, AlSi7Mg0.3, AlMg1SiCu, AlMg3, AlMg5, and AlMg9, respectively. Composite materials tested in terms of manufacturing technology include three groups. The first group includes gas pressure infiltration with liquid aluminum alloys of suitably formed porous preforms. Porous frameworks as a reinforcement for pressure-infiltrated composite materials with a matrix of aluminum alloys are produced by three methods. Al2O3 powder with the addition of 30–50% carbon fibers is uniaxially pressed, sintered, and heated to thermally degrade the carbon fibers and create the required pore sizes. In the second case, the ceramic porous skeleton is produced with the use of halloysite nanotubes HNTs by mechanical milling, press consolidation, and sintering. A third method is SLS selective laser sintering using titanium powders. Another group of manufacturing technologies is the mechanical synthesis of the mixture of AlMg1SiCu aluminum alloy powder and respectively, halloysite nanotubes HNTs in a volume fraction from 5 to 15% or multi-wall carbon nanotubes MWCNTs in a volume fraction from 0.5 to 5%, and subsequent consolidation involving plastic deformation. The third group of analyzed materials concerns composite surface layers on substrates of aluminum alloys produced by laser feathering of WC/W2C or SiC carbides. The structure and properties of the mentioned composite materials with aluminum alloys matrices are described in detail. The chapter summary provides final remarks on the importance of advanced aluminum alloy composite materials in industrial development. The importance of particular groups of engineering materials in the history and the development of the methodology for the selection of engineering materials, including the current stage of Materials 4.0, was emphasized. The importance of material design in engineering design is emphasized. Concepts of the development of societies were presented: Society 5.0 and Industry 4.0. The own concept of a holistic model of the extended Industry 4.0 was presented, taking into account advanced engineering materials and technological processes. Particular attention was paid to the importance of advanced composite materials with an aluminum alloy matrix in the context of the current stage of Industry 4.0 of the industrial revolution. Growth in the production of aluminum, its alloys, and composites with its matrix was compared with that of steel. Despite the 30 times less production, aluminum is important due to its lower density. The challenges posed by the development in the Industry 4.0 stage, including the expectations of the automotive and aviation industry, force constant progress in the development of new materials with the participation of aluminum, including the composite materials with an aluminum alloy matrix presented in this chapter.</jats:p>",,,,,Fabrication;

IoT technology deals with digital data as in additive manufacturing (AM). The potential and progressive aspects of AM embarks for functional part development instead of initial prototyping. AM is one of large-scale production with less buy-to-fly (BTF) ratio. In the present work, a novel framework has been proposed and utilized to attain adaptive bead modeling and an appropriate path plan for enhanced deposition and surface quality of weld beads. Further, the influence of input process parameters toward sustainable wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is also focused. Machine learning-based hybrid-TLBO (h-TLBO) and support vector machine (SVM) is deployed for the optimization process. With the aid of graph theory, weights are estimated for h-TLBO. The overall process parameters and entire data module is handled with IoT technology and can be accessed for processing. The simulated post-processing results are validated experimental test results and found to be in good concurrence. </jats:p>",,,95440622211176,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09544062221117660,,10.1177/09544062221117660,,,0,001-072-035-736-018; 005-149-063-532-387; 007-091-026-776-917; 008-974-763-289-161; 010-901-385-227-24X; 015-262-331-532-955; 016-399-408-672-950; 019-346-925-757-493; 019-486-409-838-187; 027-958-806-784-293; 031-873-556-482-461; 032-144-084-205-584; 035-161-775-961-112; 040-819-855-425-466; 044-487-323-226-682; 053-437-802-377-286; 067-640-371-402-575; 079-904-352-228-972; 083-184-549-822-82X; 090-919-794-193-682; 093-921-410-670-18X; 097-007-144-246-01X; 102-247-708-540-831; 115-757-441-927-704; 143-664-830-803-126; 158-830-405-754-840; 163-196-802-102-657,0,false,,

Placing the two together paves the way for a new method of active learning and also for an interesting and engaging way of presenting industry processes. It also enables students to reinforce their understanding of the fundamental concepts of fluid dynamics in an interactive way. However, this is not really being utilized yet. For this reason, in this paper, we aim to combine these two powerful tools. Furthermore, we present the framework of a modular open-source library for scientific visualization of fluid flow “OpenVisFlow” which simplifies the creation of such applications and enables seamless visualization without other software by allowing users to integrate the visualization step into the simulation code.

Such systems could lead to a different manufacturing process closer to the current market needs. In addition, the factories can be more efficient, sustainable, and environmentally friendly. This work intends to explore a different approach to the manufacturing process, where there is no production planned behind and the shop floor is a provider of services for the products to be built. For that purpose, this paper proposes an executable model defining the interaction between the different actors and representing the digital counterpart of the CPS. We use a high-level graphical language to create the executable model that allows easy and flexible experimentation with different scenarios.

Recent years have indeed assisted in drawing attention to the human-centric design of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) and to the genesis of the ‘Operator 4.0’, two novel concepts that raise significant ethical questions regarding the impact of technology on workers and society at large. This paper argues that a value-oriented and ethical technology engineering in Industry 5.0 is an urgent and sensitive topic as demonstrated by a survey administered to industry leaders from different companies. The Value Sensitive Design (VSD) approach is proposed as a principled framework to illustrate how technologies enabling human–machine symbiosis in the Factory of the Future can be designed to embody elicited human values and to illustrate actionable steps that engineers and designers can take in their design projects. Use cases based on real solutions and prototypes discuss how a design-for-values approach aids in the investigation and mitigation of ethical issues emerging from the implementation of technological solutions and, hence, support the migration to a symbiotic Factory of the Future.",10,12,1,25,Engineering management; Engineering; Situated; Work (electrical); Value (ethics); Industry 4.0; Production (economics); Value sensitive design; Use case; Factory (object-oriented programming),,,,,https://iris.unito.it/bitstream/2318/1741791/1/applsci-10-04182.pdf https://iris.unito.it/handle/2318/1741791 https://philpapers.org/rec/LONVAE https://research.tudelft.nl/en/publications/value-oriented-and-ethical-technology-engineering-in-industry-50- https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/12/4182/pdf https://iris.unical.it/handle/20.500.11770/317633 https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/12/4182/htm https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/326909057.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app10124182,,10.3390/app10124182,3036816925,,0,000-069-943-339-065; 003-098-121-921-779; 005-988-234-681-537; 015-750-890-950-793; 015-896-365-180-470; 016-131-629-212-360; 018-204-409-632-280; 022-001-976-911-088; 025-370-045-015-261; 030-538-455-823-808; 040-192-597-123-492; 046-744-066-303-436; 047-344-167-153-151; 049-816-999-056-296; 053-530-162-809-509; 058-047-952-980-10X; 060-262-622-370-337; 065-513-914-579-314; 065-934-347-978-866; 067-193-950-421-226; 071-366-058-731-140; 073-439-602-104-579; 081-480-253-364-624; 085-371-017-012-953; 088-362-827-564-703; 089-002-311-968-886; 090-864-273-291-919; 091-910-554-720-952; 091-928-035-899-634; 097-680-341-242-51X; 101-535-958-642-486; 104-547-438-104-462; 113-262-515-060-959; 120-329-562-811-556; 125-795-343-058-314; 173-954-144-095-944,78,true,cc-by,gold

Green innovation has therefore become a research hotspot. With the acceleration of the digitalization process in equipment enterprises, intelligent manufacturing equipment enterprises located at the top of the industrial chain are in urgent need of green core technology innovation activities. In order to explore the internal mechanism of core green technology innovation, this research introduces reputation theory into the evolutionary game analysis process. By constructing an evolutionary game model between the government and intelligent manufacturing equipment enterprises, this research analyzes the dynamic factors that affect the selection and evolution of the main strategies of the players in the evaluation game. The results show that corporate reputation, core green technology innovation profit, government subsidies, government reputation, and the cost for the government to support core technology, among other factors, importantly affect the game between the government and the enterprises. At the same time, since both the government and the enterprises are affected by the initial state and the maximization of the interests of both sides of the game, it is difficult for them to spontaneously reach an ideal stable and balanced state through a virtuous circle. The greater the profits and the reputation premium the core green technology innovation brings to the enterprises, the more favorable it is for the enterprises to choose core green technology innovation; government subsidies within a certain range will also drive enterprises to choose core green technology innovation. When the value of enterprise core green technology innovation is low, the cost for the government to support core green technology innovation is lower, enterprises will lose more opportunities and decline in global competitiveness, and it will become more favorable for the government to evolve towards supporting core green technology innovation. On the contrary, the government will gradually transfer its tangible hand to the intangible hand of the market based on the consideration of subsidies, innovation costs, and reputation. The results of this research are intended to provide a theoretical basis and practical reference for Chinese intelligent manufacturing equipment enterprises to better achieve green core technology innovation.</jats:p>",2022,,1,18,,,,,Philosophy and Social Science Research Planning Project of Heilongjiang Province,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/1404378,,10.1155/2022/1404378,,,0,000-657-202-855-215; 001-093-976-823-79X; 002-745-542-398-703; 026-503-596-171-036; 030-738-892-336-764; 034-617-094-108-737; 046-809-859-143-457; 112-911-481-891-746; 123-266-356-147-010; 140-726-364-076-612,0,true,cc-by,gold

A deep look at disruptive technology and innovation in retail highlights the diversity of the future of food safety technology. Food systems and food supply chains (FSCs) have undergone significant changes in their operations and structure over the last decade as globalization expands both food choice and availability. As FSCs lengthen, and food passes through extended trading relationships, transparency on food origins, methods of cultivation, harvest, processing as well as labor conditions and sustainability are reduced, along with food trust. Moreover, while the rapid pace of technology innovation benefits FSCs, we are witness to the usage of social media platforms by citizen-consumers to amplify the rhetoric related to recurring incidents and crises in food quality, food safety, food fraud, food security, sustainability, and other ethical lapses. Furthermore, we are witness to new evidence on the global burden of foodborne diseases, including noncommunicable diseases that range from severe malnutrition to morbid obesity and from severe illnesses requiring hospitalization to mortality. The World Health Organization claims that 31 foodborne hazards cause 600 million illnesses and 420,000 deaths annually. Overcoming these challenges requires a holistic reframing of our food systems and societal challenges. The emergence of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provides an overarching framework for collaboration and alignment. Japan has put forward a vision for a human-centric, technology-enabled future branded as “Society 5.0.” Increasingly, the redesign of FSCs necessitates a concerted, multistakeholder effort and the development of digitization strategies in order to cope with the evolution toward the vision of Society 5.0 and to achieve the UN SDGs.",,,1,42,Business; Marketing; Food choice; Globalization; Food industry; Food safety; Food security; Sustainable development; Sustainability; Food systems,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128189566000014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128189566000014,,,3041301066,,0,,0,false,,

In Society 5.0, a massive amount of data from the sensor will rapidly accumulate in cloud services. It requires enormous bandwidth and high-speed communication than can be achieved by using optical fiber as a transmission media. However, chromatic dispersion will limit the bandwidth and data rate due to pulse broadening, which needs compensation. Among many compensation techniques for optical fiber systems, this research investigates the effects of dispersion compensating fiber (DCF) in a single-mode-fiber (SMF) using a 10 Gbps bit rate at various source power levels. This research considers three different schemes of DCF, i.e., pre-compensation, post-compensation, and symmetrical compensation with NRZ modulation format at transmission distances up to 200 km simulated by using OptiSystem. The results show that the dispersion effect can be compensated by the proposed DCF scheme. Also, the use of amplifiers should be considered to compensate for the high attenuation effect of DCF. The system performance showed that using a three different scheme of DCF could provide a good system performance and reach a transmission distance of 200 km.",,,,,Dispersion (optics); Single-mode optical fiber; Optical fiber; Electronic engineering; Bandwidth (computing); Compensation (engineering); Computer science; Transmission medium; Transmission (telecommunications); Insertion loss,,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=9538764 http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9538520/9538628/09538764.pdf?arnumber=9538764,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/gecost52368.2021.9538764,,10.1109/gecost52368.2021.9538764,3201563743,,0,017-851-482-778-854; 018-880-086-685-073; 019-295-994-749-967; 023-987-656-824-751; 027-792-232-328-637; 030-380-575-036-270; 031-246-204-945-642; 035-477-564-014-79X; 067-339-791-465-465; 089-004-015-063-088; 095-824-400-963-673; 097-153-356-334-607; 120-794-564-508-132,0,false,,

Nimfa; Ariful Islam; Ahmad Shaharudin Abdul Latiff; Sazali Abdul Wahab,"The purpose of this study was to examine the role of innovation competitive advantage on strategic orientation dimensions of (entrepreneurial orientation, market orientation, and resource orientation) on the sustainable growth of SMEs. This study used a total of 217 responses adopting the cross-sectional survey research design from manufacturing SMEs owners/founders. The results were analysed using PLS-SEM via SmartPLS version 3.3.3. The major findings established that entrepreneurial orientation did not directly link with the sustainable growth of SMEs. The study confirmed that market orientation and resource orientation revealed a direct and significant positive link with the sustainable growth of SMEs. Similarly, innovation competitive advantage has a direct significant positive association with the sustainable growth of SMEs. Likewise, entrepreneurial orientation and market orientation have a direct and significant positive relationship with innovation competitive advantage. However, resource orientation did not significantly relate to innovation competitive advantage. The findings validated that innovation competitive advantage mediated the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation, market orientation, and the sustainable growth of SMEs. Finally, innovation competitive advantage did not mediate between resource orientation and sustainable growth of SMEs, which have not previously been proven in empirical studies. This study was designed to address the existing gaps and provide reasons to prove them. This study is indeed one of the remarkable studies in the context of SMEs, which integrates these selected variables into a single model.

The key enabling technology that has made Industry 4.0 a concrete reality is without doubt <i>collaborative robotics</i>, which is also evolving as a fundamental pillar of the next revolution, the so-called Industry 5.0. The improvement of employees&#x2019; safety and well-being, together with the increase of profitability and productivity, are indeed the main goals of human-robot collaboration (HRC) in the industrial setting. The robotic controller design and the analysis of existing decision and control techniques are crucially needed to develop innovative models and state-of-the-art methodologies for a safe, ergonomic, and efficient HRC. To this aim, this paper presents an accurate review of the most recent and relevant contributions to the related literature, focusing on the control perspective. All the surveyed works are carefully selected and categorized by target (i.e., safety, ergonomics, and efficiency), and then by problem and type of control, in presence or absence of optimization. Finally, the discussion of the achieved results and the analysis of the emerging challenges in this research field are reported, highlighting the identified gaps and the promising future developments in the context of the digital evolution. <i>Note to Practitioners</i>&#x2014;The design and development of manufacturing systems are experiencing substantial changes towards full automation. This ongoing challenge is being tackled by academia and industrial practitioners with the adoption of collaborative robots, where the skills and peculiarities of humans (e.g., intelligence, creativity, adaptability, etc.) and robots (e.g., flexibility, pinpoint accuracy, tirelessness, etc.) are combined to better perform a variety of tasks. Nevertheless, due to their different characteristics, there is an emerging need for designing suitable decision and control techniques to ensure a safe and ergonomic HRC, while keeping the highest level of productivity. Against this background, the aim of this paper is to provide researchers and practitioners with a reference source in the related field, which can help them designing and developing suitable solutions to control problems in safe, ergonomic, and efficient collaborative robotics.",19,3,1798,1819,Context (archaeology); Automation; Engineering; Control (management); Industry 4.0; Robotics; Robot; Productivity; Profitability index; Engineering management; Manufacturing engineering; Knowledge management; Risk analysis (engineering),,,,Italian University and Research Ministry through the Project Pico&Pro; National Research Program,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tase.2021.3131011,,10.1109/tase.2021.3131011,,,0,000-349-128-814-698; 003-154-907-298-097; 003-588-032-546-964; 004-099-356-916-705; 004-734-288-091-114; 004-903-010-122-021; 004-917-467-099-631; 005-150-262-361-056; 005-309-572-664-361; 005-662-121-449-467; 005-857-518-922-435; 006-040-319-302-209; 006-223-060-951-286; 006-623-881-419-863; 006-896-482-969-183; 007-174-725-206-036; 007-211-791-041-989; 007-212-954-554-282; 007-545-127-281-386; 007-585-686-532-416; 008-051-888-908-397; 009-475-259-366-199; 009-563-834-892-284; 011-552-308-982-034; 013-062-332-770-50X; 013-262-687-826-839; 013-410-847-983-65X; 013-968-267-687-03X; 014-187-467-677-084; 014-422-403-896-269; 014-567-302-125-980; 014-840-525-241-000; 015-840-647-291-053; 016-130-734-226-866; 017-063-189-219-765; 017-224-000-686-226; 017-244-317-420-15X; 017-755-618-043-954; 019-373-212-232-893; 021-398-479-730-309; 021-799-879-197-395; 022-310-734-862-702; 022-747-615-661-774; 023-383-534-602-109; 023-457-488-594-927; 024-191-989-076-096; 024-860-213-494-624; 026-479-406-988-348; 026-717-219-771-689; 026-784-799-959-142; 027-301-785-617-552; 027-461-362-966-622; 027-844-790-884-242; 027-849-288-709-134; 029-073-730-470-013; 031-172-315-470-804; 031-229-878-217-313; 035-390-442-707-297; 035-536-012-630-137; 036-152-120-747-23X; 036-281-242-034-028; 036-369-854-088-656; 036-833-757-046-610; 037-152-862-266-642; 037-235-888-420-63X; 037-587-693-445-406; 037-950-433-240-731; 038-904-037-813-023; 039-514-380-765-025; 039-747-026-553-940; 040-661-305-608-746; 042-328-266-731-736; 047-073-119-056-961; 047-674-510-503-123; 048-791-138-889-806; 049-816-999-056-296; 051-207-017-734-392; 051-673-423-174-43X; 054-807-471-057-721; 055-688-406-893-261; 056-767-160-215-883; 057-784-849-860-920; 059-233-194-338-462; 061-793-646-247-025; 063-729-328-487-572; 063-848-403-527-557; 067-912-416-154-322; 069-493-921-584-971; 071-108-384-698-604; 078-006-048-931-97X; 080-122-049-549-641; 080-184-079-101-040; 081-123-431-072-881; 081-151-710-592-001; 081-556-766-816-057; 084-219-255-233-054; 085-574-426-095-921; 091-097-808-093-946; 091-536-403-001-224; 092-881-126-868-535; 093-934-031-593-690; 094-960-605-419-129; 095-654-891-344-64X; 095-849-242-715-21X; 097-415-646-164-754; 099-747-298-582-08X; 100-435-600-517-299; 100-891-688-805-138; 101-991-100-515-346; 103-485-545-961-905; 106-470-097-774-176; 108-592-501-049-872; 110-189-873-887-166; 111-819-685-064-541; 111-952-296-634-224; 116-783-289-698-518; 117-269-463-468-211; 120-228-273-469-368; 120-997-971-731-155; 121-826-592-271-734; 121-846-282-477-890; 121-958-933-823-475; 125-680-873-561-371; 130-927-535-504-369; 135-333-805-284-233; 143-256-941-443-335; 149-287-650-946-530; 150-139-972-911-50X; 150-470-027-672-209; 152-780-715-844-445; 159-854-496-588-106; 167-874-018-558-509; 176-653-938-719-851; 177-698-648-541-51X; 179-325-125-515-161,3,true,cc-by-nc-nd,hybrid

Nudurupati; David Lascelles; Gillian Wright; Nick Yip,"Purpose; ; ; ; ; There is an extensive research literature on servitisation and the related field of product-service systems that has emerged independently from different fields including engineering, management, design and environmental studies. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a structured literature review to explore, identify and synthesise the multi-disciplinary research challenges in the journey towards servitisation.; ; ; ; ; Design/methodology/approach; ; ; ; ; The research approach is a systematic literature review using key word searches and citation tracking for research reported between 1990 and 2013 in research databases that cover the fields which have generated the body of knowledge.; ; ; ; ; Findings; ; ; ; ; One of the key findings from the extant literature on servitisation is that it suffers from three fundamental weaknesses. First, numerous studies are conceptual in nature with limited practicality. Second, there are relatively few empirical studies, and often the findings relate to a single case study based on the insights of a limited number of senior managers. Third, often the dynamics are insufficiently studied in these organisations because data for most cases are collected post-event.; ; ; ; ; Research limitations/implications; ; ; ; ; Based on the literature review and its shortfalls, this paper proposes a holistic framework of eight themes that require further attention from academic researchers in order that a more complete conceptual understanding of servitisation is developed to support practice.; ; ; ; ; Practical implications; ; ; ; ; Each theme in the framework has an associated list of questions that can be addressed through research and presented to managers as a challenge agenda to improve their servitisation efforts. That servitisation is associated with differentiation and competitive advantage makes this a valuable approach for managing corporate performance.; ; ; ; ; Originality/value; ; ; ; ; Research from multi-disciplinary sources is synergised in order to develop an overarching servitisation agenda that transcends domain-based boundaries. This paves the way for an approach to servitisation that is coherent and harmonious.",26,6,745,763,Empirical research; Single-subject design; Psychology; Marketing; Body of knowledge; Systematic review; Originality; Knowledge management; Competitive advantage; Use value; Environmental studies,,,,,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JSTP-02-2015-0045/full/pdf?title=eight-challenges-of-servitisation-for-the-configuration-measurement-and-management-of-organisations https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JSTP-02-2015-0045 https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/57673/ https://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/619071/ https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/publications/eight-challenges-of-servitisation-for-the-configuration-measureme https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JSTP-02-2015-0045/full/html https://core.ac.uk/download/41993189.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/jstp-02-2015-0045,,10.1108/jstp-02-2015-0045,2384107006,,0,001-058-081-046-666; 001-402-801-144-134; 001-843-811-894-522; 003-258-485-239-500; 005-590-991-432-327; 005-985-581-594-522; 006-633-095-450-408; 012-195-921-218-417; 014-282-366-429-351; 014-505-080-820-780; 015-545-122-998-820; 016-137-824-557-601; 016-374-907-967-808; 019-043-805-141-231; 023-060-229-266-181; 023-822-075-001-17X; 027-067-308-055-128; 030-804-284-064-606; 032-494-957-755-949; 033-632-042-853-785; 033-681-269-357-672; 034-954-597-452-166; 035-787-424-936-331; 035-963-349-536-61X; 036-887-321-843-049; 037-039-641-320-524; 037-120-730-434-134; 037-296-569-315-081; 038-060-697-061-827; 039-510-715-803-401; 039-536-743-545-687; 040-413-474-042-875; 040-460-630-162-839; 040-632-252-276-633; 042-110-965-689-651; 049-563-580-502-16X; 050-203-698-974-038; 051-902-016-337-330; 053-419-693-088-944; 055-812-738-756-074; 057-778-795-003-462; 058-367-606-844-255; 059-061-999-730-906; 060-014-899-131-985; 061-072-264-269-835; 061-244-710-653-035; 064-938-987-313-418; 070-207-391-303-268; 071-541-908-811-653; 071-693-995-776-448; 073-324-537-079-281; 076-444-348-257-793; 080-199-807-404-843; 081-733-252-599-416; 081-759-604-312-542; 082-220-771-871-04X; 084-731-973-617-338; 090-727-566-793-276; 091-419-255-984-915; 093-719-808-189-629; 095-005-391-794-580; 095-637-169-270-220; 096-038-597-194-465; 098-680-166-910-58X; 099-349-231-635-454; 105-210-333-076-365; 105-246-576-380-42X; 106-368-138-097-28X; 109-449-363-209-667; 126-836-473-462-918; 135-453-993-226-124; 135-798-350-699-423; 138-072-340-689-391; 140-624-864-435-231; 144-519-733-133-55X; 151-678-990-916-40X; 155-227-346-684-225; 155-272-289-341-48X; 165-545-112-576-623; 172-800-178-699-983; 173-717-220-882-386,34,true,,green
123-745-968-235-511,Insight into the Balancing Effect of a Digital Green Innovation (DGI) Network to Improve the Performance of DGI for Industry 5.0: Roles of Digital Empowerment and Green Organization Flexibility,2022-07-05,2022,journal article,Systems,20798954,MDPI AG,,Chengli Hu; Hongtao Yang; Shi Yin,"<jats:p>Under the background of double carbon target and digital intelligence era, the innovation resources and innovation environment that manufacturing enterprises rely on have shown exponential growth. Digital green innovation (DGI) has gradually become the mainstream paradigm of innovation. How to achieve a balance between a local DGI network (LDGIN) and a remote DGI network (RDGIN) and how to use the role of digital empowerment and green organization flexibility to improve the performance of DGI are very important issues facing manufacturing enterprises at present. However, this problem has not been fully addressed in the existing research. In this study, the influence mechanism of LDGIN and RDGIN on the DGI performance of manufacturing enterprises was revealed, considering the moderating role of digital empowerment and green organization flexibility. The linear regression method was used to analyze the 562 valid data obtained by questionnaire survey. The results of this study are as follows. The effect of the DGI network on manufacturing enterprises’ DGI performance is heterogeneous because of LDGIN and RDGIN. The establishment of embedded links in a DGI network inevitably requires manufacturing enterprises to pay the corresponding costs. The over-embedding of manufacturing enterprises into RDGIN will have a negative impact on DGI performance. The balance between LDGIN and RDGIN has an important impact on manufacturing enterprises’ operation. The comprehensive balance and relative balance indexes constructed in this paper show that an appropriate balance can promote the improvement of the DGI performance of manufacturing enterprises. Digital transformation and organizational structure innovation are changing the business model of manufacturing enterprises and can regulate the relationship between the LDGIN and RDGIN and the DGI performance of manufacturing enterprises. The balance of DGI network embedding in practice shows the important role and enlightening significance of local and remote search in developing countries.</jats:p>",10,4,97,97,Flexibility (engineering); Business; Industrial organization; Manufacturing; Digital transformation; Balance (ability); Process management; Operations management; Computer science,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/systems10040097,,10.3390/systems10040097,,,0,000-905-205-541-553; 001-998-899-553-736; 002-675-386-476-536; 003-079-085-633-847; 006-208-215-788-351; 007-876-983-918-032; 009-065-722-352-740; 009-121-014-555-057; 012-377-342-003-136; 012-836-919-511-187; 013-044-191-813-561; 013-752-033-907-797; 015-628-088-610-602; 016-320-267-172-324; 016-595-734-832-25X; 017-747-964-995-413; 018-557-923-448-236; 020-490-193-487-45X; 021-843-543-155-568; 021-870-293-444-335; 021-993-970-323-208; 022-053-613-750-865; 024-229-385-077-195; 024-233-361-244-86X; 024-513-049-354-50X; 025-606-063-549-02X; 025-614-564-772-051; 025-920-132-689-575; 026-861-169-641-750; 028-248-497-041-049; 028-942-189-455-610; 029-074-671-542-148; 030-101-051-833-426; 034-496-467-458-505; 034-617-094-108-737; 035-466-391-061-171; 037-207-588-109-673; 039-024-640-828-300; 041-689-645-906-978; 042-886-903-959-052; 044-765-909-900-408; 045-592-491-973-16X; 047-851-862-670-675; 051-906-996-843-324; 051-969-797-133-31X; 052-230-732-286-834; 057-845-219-652-066; 058-108-144-684-00X; 059-115-149-350-078; 060-530-272-312-118; 064-277-795-970-530; 072-180-038-418-30X; 072-339-930-820-086; 073-053-229-980-025; 074-654-255-187-127; 076-723-973-008-305; 080-023-771-764-820; 081-366-195-602-129; 086-764-418-688-886; 086-936-540-313-752; 087-690-399-614-159; 087-873-725-055-498; 088-268-841-136-819; 094-275-122-264-980; 094-936-615-846-124; 098-941-243-510-970; 101-362-936-249-875; 101-892-923-066-269; 102-077-220-210-493; 103-263-291-368-971; 103-283-428-251-546; 104-294-026-807-580; 112-074-051-269-556; 117-316-045-696-341; 133-722-662-751-530; 142-366-944-206-176; 157-644-507-299-695; 159-230-690-402-381; 166-295-681-583-169; 170-694-723-712-460; 171-564-090-961-053; 171-802-905-729-337; 172-510-878-345-451; 198-832-570-152-835; 199-243-720-910-859; 199-297-378-932-350; 199-999-351-308-968,0,true,cc-by,gold

This paper analyses the specific challenges facing agriculture along the farming supply chain to permit the operative implementation of Industry 4.0 guidelines. The subsequent scientific value is an investigation of how Industry 4.0 approaches can be improved and be pertinent to the agricultural sector. However, industry is progressing at a much faster rate than agriculture. In fact, already today experts talk about Industry 5.0. On the other hand, the 4.0 revolution in agriculture is still limited to a few innovative firms. For this reason, this work deals with how technological development affects different sectors (industry and agriculture) in different ways. In this innovative background, despite the advantages of industry or agriculture 4.0 for large enterprises, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) often face complications in such innovative processes due to the continuous development in innovations and technologies. Policy makers should propose strategies, calls for proposals with aim of supporting SMEs to invest on these technologies and making them more competitive in the marketplace.",7,1,36,,Supply chain; Agriculture; Business; Work (electrical); Value (ethics); Industry 4.0; Open source; Industrial organization,,,,,https://doaj.org/article/b19013c49aac44229c154adb6f38cd41 https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/7/1/36 https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/7/1/36/pdf https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/d7bfc399-92fd-37e8-ba51-53b5c67eb5f6/,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr7010036,,10.3390/pr7010036,2909214268,,0,000-707-095-828-926; 000-932-677-186-821; 002-375-014-156-924; 004-013-998-120-573; 004-073-557-032-994; 004-771-471-010-549; 005-412-717-909-434; 006-574-304-006-681; 008-142-780-122-409; 008-559-739-084-440; 008-659-601-165-174; 009-612-835-819-538; 011-575-011-664-790; 012-750-062-281-425; 013-287-665-466-861; 015-320-598-076-55X; 015-447-374-583-278; 016-819-194-616-838; 017-503-217-862-157; 018-312-933-510-763; 021-105-821-279-401; 022-152-084-543-425; 023-702-294-329-62X; 024-168-934-494-455; 024-169-532-926-82X; 024-175-834-546-84X; 025-339-438-408-36X; 026-185-700-868-861; 027-353-477-094-205; 028-028-892-088-002; 031-541-084-233-73X; 032-479-384-764-761; 033-541-372-628-755; 038-878-632-218-88X; 038-904-037-813-023; 039-491-120-499-550; 040-532-370-874-177; 043-046-580-359-611; 044-283-009-559-396; 045-936-475-493-242; 050-031-555-841-66X; 052-603-569-095-390; 056-002-925-128-630; 056-285-650-359-87X; 056-511-223-277-530; 057-271-428-664-151; 057-526-897-621-789; 058-904-627-664-051; 067-211-057-616-713; 069-282-642-355-578; 070-558-536-174-423; 075-829-197-077-867; 076-991-386-599-906; 077-605-560-113-421; 077-884-739-260-282; 080-364-028-866-332; 082-140-051-993-161; 082-311-579-208-997; 084-612-965-970-13X; 085-371-017-012-953; 087-147-779-068-60X; 087-359-044-206-754; 087-858-407-202-952; 088-824-929-291-009; 091-280-479-944-812; 092-147-288-927-925; 094-200-044-274-633; 099-125-780-663-236; 099-225-880-474-086; 100-124-216-391-558; 100-549-579-714-540; 104-963-683-392-202; 107-962-367-867-346; 115-864-120-174-362; 116-962-226-076-678; 125-795-343-058-314; 126-081-607-470-719; 127-944-937-480-490; 130-076-096-295-389; 132-935-066-424-819; 135-038-723-068-121; 135-317-782-054-610; 135-553-141-898-826; 136-914-967-448-554; 137-586-336-320-745; 141-063-052-960-216; 143-121-184-186-694; 145-773-351-334-399; 146-473-356-444-943; 148-428-384-290-590; 149-868-228-236-969; 150-701-964-674-511; 160-056-827-368-01X; 161-418-415-667-082; 161-532-612-781-473; 165-713-448-765-487; 173-476-740-323-33X; 175-873-353-864-330; 183-635-606-354-141; 186-087-051-227-820,155,true,cc-by,gold

Suhaib; Mohammad Asjad; Bashir Salah,"<jats:p> In the present era of technological advancement and rapid change, mankind faces different kinds of challenges. The product lifecycle has been shortened dramatically, and the manufacturing industry is moving from mass production to the high personalization of mass products. This era is widely known as the fourth industrial revolution or Industry 4.0 (I4.0). It seems that soon it will be inevitable for every society. The paper briefly focuses on empirical insights into the impact of I4.0 on various sectors of society. The traditional approaches to manufacturing, servicing, and public policy planning will no longer remain effective and would be transformed. I4.0 should be observed as an Opportunity 4.0 and draw attention to the industry, academia, and policymakers’ in changing scenarios. Expectations from them are also underlined. Its favorable features in the post-COVID-19 era are also discussed. This short article invites attention to foresee beyond I4.0, e.g. Industry 5.0 and more such progressions. </jats:p>",,,,,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); Virology,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/s2424862222500129,,10.1142/s2424862222500129,,,0,001-294-103-884-762; 002-080-619-054-658; 004-771-471-010-549; 008-273-255-136-124; 010-491-668-935-335; 016-819-194-616-838; 017-415-713-662-955; 018-765-644-135-831; 019-219-882-433-111; 023-205-314-705-315; 023-957-604-328-062; 025-042-876-675-970; 025-131-859-546-629; 028-232-581-949-707; 033-645-147-890-403; 036-652-321-315-178; 036-663-344-685-634; 038-904-037-813-023; 040-532-370-874-177; 040-778-348-220-273; 041-437-717-635-476; 042-611-611-135-403; 048-038-873-341-337; 049-655-180-277-678; 052-975-240-408-918; 057-214-042-880-707; 064-571-314-497-250; 064-914-878-452-615; 074-895-567-621-479; 081-251-314-275-707; 088-589-063-696-437; 091-620-396-383-798; 094-019-771-819-795; 096-994-446-032-91X; 108-969-550-365-174; 109-440-039-575-621; 113-767-551-070-365; 116-962-226-076-678; 119-806-532-860-262; 127-157-823-317-473; 144-212-810-500-469; 145-595-525-463-870; 161-505-884-447-010; 175-121-540-436-380; 175-819-230-922-230,0,false,,

The IoT builds on (1) broadband wireless internet connectivity, (2) miniaturized sensors embedded in animate and inanimate objects ranging from the house cat to the milk carton in your smart fridge, and (3) AI and cobots making sense of Big Data collected by sensors. Industry 4.0 is a high-tech strategy for manufacturing automation that employs the IoT, thus creating the Smart Factory.

Sreenath,"Developing technologies, advancement in science, evolving globalized perspectives and the massive dependence on digital platform for a routine sustenance has led to the core building of Industry 4.0. In general, industry 4.0 focuses on the metamorphosis of all industrial components with the help of strong digital support. It's very often interlinked with the successful fourth industrial revolution. It is to be noted that the very fourth outburst of industrialization plunges forward in order to achieve an optimized and sustained form of production. With the uplift of the fourth generation of this stirring revolution, the efficient extraction of advanced informatics analytics along with internetworked machines have grown to a great extent, complementing the digital platform. On the other hand, society 5.0 involves a human centric community which is capable of striking a balance between the economical proliferations and resolving societal liabilities by the core combination of cyber and physical space. Just like how industry 4.0 carries out the digital transformation of every industrial perspective, society 5.0 encourages mundane life to leap towards a digital revamp expanding across different tiers of the community. Indeed, the rapid change of information and Communication Technology along with the portrayal of society 5.0 as a global trend and a key aspect of the Science and Technology Basic plan, the interplay of the two proves to be a constant support for each other. This paper discusses about the future look of industry 4.0 and society 5.0 and elaborates on the challenges and opportunities rooted from them.",,,,,Engineering management; Digital transformation; Sustenance; Industry 4.0; Computer science; Industrialisation; Industrial Revolution; Plan (drawing); Information and Communications Technology; Analytics,,,,,http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9402219/9402221/09402498.pdf?arnumber=9402498 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=9402498,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iccci50826.2021.9402498,,10.1109/iccci50826.2021.9402498,3157561883,,0,007-893-540-948-00X; 015-008-734-610-504; 016-960-237-498-599; 019-763-285-018-963; 020-555-574-954-829; 027-192-978-746-115; 033-333-885-606-168; 062-757-415-379-846; 064-042-765-914-689; 072-329-848-195-489; 086-885-197-186-655; 088-865-245-126-222; 100-137-794-930-923; 102-424-326-687-39X; 104-963-683-392-202; 105-049-891-404-994; 107-308-686-388-40X; 113-767-551-070-365; 170-563-722-411-658,17,false,,

Tookey; Ali GhaffarianHoseini; Amirhosein GhaffarianHoseini,"<jats:p>The construction industry’s inherent fragmentation fuels Construction Supply Chain (CSC) complexity. Logistics form an essential part of the CSC in terms of costs and project management. In turn, transportation accounts for more than half the logistics costs due to construction materials being low-cost/high-volume, and most other logistics processes being business processes and not physical ones. Construction transport is almost entirely road bound, one of the least sustainable modes with externalities far out of proportion to its numbers. Ergo, its optimisation presents substantial greening (de-carbonisation) opportunity, with potentially far-reaching sustainability impacts. The ASI (Avoid-Shift-Improve) concept considers activity, modal structure, and energy intensity/efficiency as transport carbon components, providing a fundamental optimisation framework. 93% of New Zealand’s freight (a third of it construction related) is road bound, with 99% fossil-fuel (diesel) dependence.

How shared economy can perform a superlative role in augmenting the corporate sustainable performance is another interesting gap that needs to be unveiled. This study investigates the linkage between shared economy practices and corporate triple bottom line (TBL) in three core streams—environmental performance (ENVP), social performance (SP), and economic performance (EP)—using empirical data. An additional factor of industry 5.0 (i5.0) technologies was treated as a moderator between shared economy and TBL. The findings assured the positive nexus of shared economy (i.e., contract manufacturing services, professional services, data entry &amp; clerical services, creative and multimedia services, sales and marketing services, software development services, and writing or translation services) on TBL (i.e., ENVP, SP, and EP). The positive moderating influence of i5.0 technologies was further affirmed between the relationships of shared economy and TBL. The findings yield multidimensional insights for operational management to adopt shared economy and i5.0 practices to improve corporate TBL in today’s competitive era. In addition, this study accentuates the notion of shared economy by providing positive evidence from developing nations. The study also highlights insightful implications for managers along with future avenues for the researchers to conduct additional multi-directional studies worldwide. </jats:p>",12,2,215824402210946,215824402210946,Business; Sharing economy; Nexus (standard); Moderation; New economy; Marketing; Industrial organization; Economy,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440221094608,,10.1177/21582440221094608,,,0,000-776-628-195-009; 000-818-261-236-435; 003-438-619-894-518; 004-006-445-440-926; 007-307-036-306-863; 008-169-619-415-651; 008-621-703-725-466; 010-141-039-770-62X; 010-506-995-388-331; 010-849-289-960-171; 012-253-200-466-632; 014-350-475-723-690; 014-727-582-122-88X; 018-345-855-897-35X; 020-243-459-775-902; 020-586-257-221-471; 022-918-800-297-808; 027-938-343-459-516; 028-170-616-037-29X; 029-434-241-679-095; 030-487-106-944-436; 033-171-354-077-456; 033-737-224-249-360; 033-851-018-944-660; 034-055-149-209-518; 035-343-856-410-475; 039-198-104-080-036; 039-216-417-389-954; 042-339-152-816-663; 044-209-264-384-954; 048-092-008-205-493; 050-659-529-623-662; 054-268-201-012-881; 062-534-002-294-248; 063-884-128-799-395; 064-750-484-696-862; 064-916-137-475-413; 065-141-371-059-51X; 069-884-471-095-350; 070-273-057-201-456; 074-008-673-725-26X; 076-940-887-060-490; 077-314-610-708-82X; 081-491-836-564-277; 082-430-054-790-904; 082-629-209-913-998; 083-125-061-921-138; 087-306-310-684-160; 090-332-878-930-771; 095-322-543-910-640; 096-994-446-032-91X; 102-424-326-687-39X; 105-538-482-028-753; 106-377-304-980-209; 109-330-961-434-647; 109-927-900-009-331; 112-243-591-953-257; 117-787-872-394-604; 120-901-160-585-300; 129-324-374-869-536; 129-646-199-734-707; 140-463-210-737-260; 145-871-337-061-354; 150-739-442-590-808; 155-421-162-901-490; 155-643-440-875-282; 158-568-511-911-351; 158-935-422-665-12X; 160-944-910-939-034; 168-753-940-907-200; 170-005-163-700-405; 179-608-372-698-452,0,true,cc-by,gold
128-419-307-357-552,Multi-Scale Assessment of the Economic Impacts of Flooding: Evidence from Firm to Macro-Level Analysis in the Chinese Manufacturing Sector,2019-04-01,2019,journal article,Sustainability,20711050,MDPI AG,Switzerland,Xi Hu; Raghav Pant; Jim W. Hall; Swenja Surminski; Jiashun Huang,"We present an empirical study to systemically estimate flooding impacts, linking across scales from individual firms through to the macro levels in China. To this end, we combine a detailed firm-level econometric analysis of 399,356 firms with a macroeconomic input-output model to estimate flood impacts on China’s manufacturing sector over the period 2003–2010. We find that large flooding events on average reduce firm outputs (measured by labor productivity) by about 28.3% per year. Using an input-output analysis, we estimate the potential macroeconomic impact to be a 12.3% annual loss in total output, which amounts to 15,416 RMB billion. Impacts can propagate from manufacturing firms, which are the focus of our empirical analysis, through to other economic sectors that may not actually be located in floodplains but can still be affected by economic disruptions. Lagged flood effects over the following two years are estimated to be a further 5.4% at the firm level and their associated potential effects are at a 2.3% loss in total output or 2,486 RMB billion at the macro-level. These results indicate that the scale of economic impacts from flooding is much larger than microanalyses of direct damage indicate, thus justifying greater action, at a policy level and by individual firms, to manage flood risk.",11,7,1933,,Empirical research; Economic sector; Floodplain; Economics; Natural resource economics; Flooding (psychology); Economic impact analysis; Productivity; Scale (social sciences); Flood myth,,,,"St. Antony's College, University of Oxford; European Commission; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council",https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/100534/ https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/7/1933 https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jsusta/v11y2019i7p1933-d218995.html https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/7/1933/pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/196515473.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11071933,,10.3390/su11071933,2932002163,,0,002-199-418-778-455; 002-232-213-447-881; 003-777-742-922-525; 004-110-527-848-001; 006-262-118-172-667; 008-128-467-093-858; 014-538-173-799-934; 014-633-411-314-61X; 015-118-897-816-141; 017-564-088-930-334; 018-884-205-039-540; 022-306-112-266-760; 031-580-347-742-774; 032-307-520-377-432; 035-998-338-159-45X; 036-259-536-096-856; 037-310-947-988-821; 038-196-787-346-28X; 038-950-551-709-760; 043-488-731-053-870; 044-009-867-458-063; 044-893-017-201-376; 048-125-002-973-844; 049-633-165-420-619; 057-302-574-206-57X; 057-952-755-304-253; 067-092-963-652-696; 067-529-002-697-026; 072-901-026-059-01X; 073-497-874-542-56X; 075-442-434-893-061; 087-463-945-415-254; 089-649-460-325-849; 096-427-271-664-462; 104-728-694-241-530; 144-472-182-448-516; 145-581-989-589-706; 160-507-931-573-080; 169-113-246-589-944,8,true,cc-by,gold

At the same time, wireless communications are becoming crucial to smart manufacturing within the scope of Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 is a developing trend of high-speed data exchange in automation for manufacturing technologies and is referred to as the fourth industrial revolution. This trend requires fast, reliable, low-latency, and cost-effective data transmissions with fast synchronizations to ensure smooth operations for various processes. VLC is capable of providing reliable, low-latency, and secure connections that do not penetrate walls and is immune to electromagnetic interference. As such, this paper aims to show the potential of VLC for industrial wireless applications by examining the latest research work in VLC systems. This work also highlights and classifies challenges that might arise with the applicability of VLC and visible light positioning (VLP) systems in these settings. Given the previous work performed in these areas, and the major ongoing experimental projects looking into the use of VLC systems for industrial applications, the use of VLC and VLP systems for industrial applications shows promising potential.",9,12,2157,,Automation; Visible light communication; Electromagnetic interference; Scope (project management); Optical wireless; Computer science; Wireless; Information and Communications Technology; Telecommunications,,,,Horizon 2020,https://northumbria-test.eprints-hosting.org/id/document/273257 https://researchportal.northumbria.ac.uk/en/publications/visible-light-communications-for-industrial-applicationschallenge https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/9/12/2157/htm https://researchportal.northumbria.ac.uk/files/39897729/electronics-09-02157-v2.pdf https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/9/12/2157/pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/362990839.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics9122157,,10.3390/electronics9122157,3111288590,,0,001-295-302-541-978; 003-886-937-447-317; 005-585-755-143-674; 005-689-703-408-42X; 005-771-884-036-815; 006-907-893-118-878; 007-888-301-193-264; 008-023-963-020-411; 008-404-008-444-741; 009-581-709-682-623; 010-396-993-255-776; 010-402-738-806-583; 010-795-135-653-194; 011-077-825-505-973; 011-129-645-989-095; 011-843-051-919-047; 011-973-514-614-633; 013-853-095-137-591; 013-965-875-718-449; 014-014-100-814-024; 015-946-094-673-240; 016-402-490-651-722; 016-726-296-395-703; 017-415-713-662-955; 017-444-483-537-210; 017-922-771-237-988; 018-488-841-195-734; 019-739-439-041-454; 020-017-449-802-57X; 020-307-435-710-370; 020-580-113-023-145; 021-005-776-117-236; 022-011-600-040-906; 023-465-146-409-373; 023-914-675-223-145; 024-494-138-301-185; 024-990-668-392-208; 025-766-059-123-950; 026-380-570-072-673; 027-075-527-335-082; 028-174-739-162-216; 028-398-382-996-383; 028-573-718-470-621; 029-004-154-037-449; 029-621-538-666-870; 031-203-476-634-370; 031-721-655-733-278; 032-147-915-194-139; 032-657-638-942-783; 032-735-102-772-529; 033-244-426-609-541; 033-274-213-180-662; 033-320-841-894-978; 034-499-768-608-048; 035-553-466-535-243; 035-835-295-750-12X; 036-055-465-565-824; 036-819-217-681-84X; 037-486-070-555-999; 037-568-618-992-449; 038-270-546-991-109; 038-406-633-043-713; 040-389-188-043-204; 041-822-593-755-273; 041-999-636-043-158; 042-452-316-634-087; 043-455-992-944-005; 044-642-569-456-565; 044-877-012-478-835; 046-917-117-499-591; 048-152-610-866-747; 049-038-507-010-526; 049-583-774-399-293; 050-188-425-306-912; 050-997-950-548-215; 052-484-611-263-265; 053-289-666-047-677; 053-306-661-254-249; 054-324-922-995-682; 055-587-987-189-48X; 055-842-833-383-71X; 056-257-301-645-888; 056-685-037-542-804; 057-298-631-130-665; 058-693-555-538-891; 058-819-526-264-677; 059-263-707-236-611; 059-325-602-164-560; 059-345-031-889-346; 059-674-482-572-695; 060-129-342-788-365; 060-683-016-918-134; 062-232-255-022-28X; 062-716-279-884-491; 062-737-639-449-884; 062-760-407-185-74X; 065-743-962-266-965; 066-619-120-842-995; 067-692-253-332-785; 068-338-686-818-638; 068-645-611-992-623; 069-152-587-871-602; 069-236-662-292-167; 069-407-228-070-354; 069-950-521-975-675; 070-539-498-378-711; 072-357-998-469-56X; 072-603-156-089-465; 072-748-467-775-013; 073-192-731-763-114; 073-506-539-317-607; 073-963-217-245-384; 074-756-556-757-709; 075-132-515-900-573; 075-467-201-498-387; 076-072-873-565-570; 077-356-972-249-89X; 078-651-219-450-33X; 078-697-448-069-931; 082-661-955-585-527; 082-947-153-132-378; 083-201-456-373-190; 083-371-330-948-237; 083-579-385-490-828; 083-769-842-199-460; 084-187-176-729-859; 085-687-301-980-418; 085-793-760-767-818; 085-840-254-001-181; 086-959-572-774-395; 087-848-994-153-796; 088-818-412-419-865; 089-663-594-943-766; 089-801-955-872-602; 089-865-246-285-803; 090-540-000-860-441; 092-323-231-992-742; 094-976-416-538-58X; 098-952-889-146-868; 101-856-080-590-450; 102-424-326-687-39X; 103-001-104-183-489; 107-271-047-139-371; 108-275-468-824-654; 110-351-248-381-453; 110-550-134-896-856; 110-641-472-718-749; 112-553-229-487-891; 114-762-342-801-225; 116-334-056-876-594; 116-438-947-818-44X; 117-964-265-984-893; 119-677-215-435-029; 120-902-340-205-509; 122-525-990-773-171; 123-167-066-993-012; 123-894-479-808-509; 124-479-806-648-37X; 126-954-921-857-022; 130-103-712-690-376; 132-589-810-351-496; 134-597-731-467-354; 136-815-595-063-560; 137-042-125-417-285; 139-696-665-502-507; 141-320-979-384-896; 142-767-569-842-150; 149-123-179-326-688; 150-777-956-906-301; 151-285-189-365-510; 152-826-577-650-079; 154-123-663-400-676; 154-422-125-418-73X; 158-833-011-569-136; 158-906-834-532-347; 158-977-045-181-255; 160-801-734-658-437; 161-000-456-671-792; 169-866-362-853-315; 170-061-625-445-549; 172-795-633-788-475; 176-583-439-390-018; 189-802-340-166-39X; 193-311-056-197-816,21,true,cc-by,gold

Baburin,"<jats:p>The article examines the influence of natural history and socio-cultural processes on the formation of industrial areas within the borders of modern Russia and partially the Russian Empire and the USSR. Basically, the evolutionary approach is used in the version of cyclic genetic dynamics. To assess the long-term effects of the “path dependence”, we analyze the 150-year cycle of industrialization within the borders of Historical Russia. To do this, we use the mechanisms of spatial localization of Kondratiev cycles and associated technological structures of the first (first-second), second (third-fourth)) and the third (fifth) industrial revolution. As an information base, data on the number of people employed and the volume of industrial production (in comparable prices) are used, and for the XX century, data on the dynamics of fixed assets of industry are also used. The relationship between modernization schemes on the old basis (within the boundaries of old industrial areas) and in the areas of pioneer development is revealed. The stability of industry specializations within the grid of industrial areas is considered separately. Based on the results obtained, the conclusion is made about the stability of old industrial cores of localization of industrial potential, the continuity of the spectrum of their specializations (not the replacement of old industries with new ones, but the addition). There is also a repetition in the regions of the new development of the General scheme of the chosen path and the inherited track.</jats:p>",,3,26,39,Economics; Economic geography; Production (economics); Path dependence,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5922/1994-5280-2020-3-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.5922/1994-5280-2020-3-3,,10.5922/1994-5280-2020-3-3,3119247830,,0,021-121-543-879-270; 053-380-318-319-565; 054-915-064-259-180; 057-091-449-818-019; 058-477-259-753-451; 080-699-713-713-777; 128-758-293-802-470; 138-668-634-380-370,0,false,,

The flows increase diversity due to human contact across cultural boundaries that add complexity to Jakarta's society. Concerning the English language and culture classroom in Jakarta, the learners contribute to the diversity and bring in varieties of English language and culture. The learners are predominantly digital natives who earn English from games, media, and technology. On one hand, diversity becomes a competitive edge, though on the other hand diversity is the source of social capital in English language and culture classrooms in Jakarta. Giving room for the varieties is aligned with cosmopolitan pedagogy which allows dialogue of local diversities to ensure global community membership which is dominated by the global virtual community. The pedagogy has been put forward as a pathway towards intercultural communicative competence. Therefore, this study is interested to explore the trace of cosmopolitan pedagogy in the selected English classroom in Jakarta, Indonesia. Furthermore, this study shall reveal the reification of cosmopolitan pedagogy within the syllabus, teaching materials, language policies, and classroom practices. The result of this study shall put forward the pedagogy to nurture the digital native learners in Jakarta, Indonesia, to prepare the learners in virtual community which will dominate society 5.0.",,,,,Cultural diversity; Sociology; Digital native; Pedagogy; Communicative competence; Virtual community; Varieties of English; Diversity (politics); Syllabus; Social capital,,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=9573245 http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9571070/9573172/09573245.pdf?arnumber=9573245,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/isemantic52711.2021.9573245,,10.1109/isemantic52711.2021.9573245,3208150912,,0,014-124-973-269-368; 016-097-006-701-583; 029-290-182-291-030; 034-360-218-852-736; 047-428-136-709-936; 060-494-852-561-123; 074-278-862-878-863; 080-483-574-478-013; 081-998-847-783-937; 087-151-655-480-477; 104-765-087-530-341; 114-782-413-061-622; 127-462-323-831-477; 156-989-561-237-126,0,false,,

In modern manufacturing, system data are collected both from the field through sensors and by exploiting complex simulations. Data analysis techniques became crucial to build and maintain any efficient production line, while autonomous systems and robots are the main focus of researchers and practitioners. This pervasive use of artificial intelligence derived technologies pushed humans to the border of production systems. Industry 5.0 aims at bringing the attention back to humans in production lines while magnifying their interactions with intelligent systems. This new trend will impact the design of future manufacturing infrastructures, increasing their complexity. Engineers will need modeling and developing tools able to capture this complexity. In this paper, we analyze the modeling languages and tools being used, identifying their strengths and weaknesses. Then, we propose some possible directions to provide engineers with the expressive power needed to tackle the challenges posed by Industry 5.0.",,,01,08,Variety (cybernetics); Modeling language; Data science; Market research; Field (computer science); Computer science; Intelligent decision support system; Strengths and weaknesses; Robot; Production line,,,,"Ministry of Education, University and Research",https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/fdl/fdl2021.html#GaiardelliSLF21 https://iris.univr.it/handle/11562/1051315,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/fdl53530.2021.9568371,,10.1109/fdl53530.2021.9568371,3210087482,,0,004-108-953-159-783; 005-323-818-127-007; 010-121-126-907-817; 010-391-030-336-394; 011-812-943-546-360; 012-427-153-047-386; 017-415-713-662-955; 017-510-511-735-568; 021-606-380-161-111; 024-184-653-637-51X; 028-210-117-820-064; 029-635-949-739-840; 030-136-936-524-671; 036-273-164-113-723; 038-727-616-142-127; 040-237-725-643-430; 041-437-717-635-476; 051-339-975-336-51X; 056-490-397-717-268; 063-544-779-910-914; 071-788-380-906-199; 073-899-203-503-836; 081-143-176-106-498; 094-321-369-641-623; 098-158-086-899-649; 099-826-157-168-462; 117-015-466-519-416; 117-269-463-468-211; 120-539-772-672-326; 120-879-907-393-326; 122-520-280-898-276; 125-177-329-002-690; 136-639-649-072-770; 140-438-863-130-373; 151-628-728-979-821; 158-625-738-753-35X; 158-634-549-051-900; 172-804-518-376-450,1,false,,

Almost all technology developed and created comes from research carried out on an ongoing basis and using a scientific approach. Science learning is currently developing and adapting to the needs of the times. The development of science occurs by utilizing collaboration with other branches of science such as technology, mechanical engineering, and mathematics. The distinctive feature of collaboration that has become an important value in IR 4.0 also occurs in the field of education. Big Data, as the hallmark of Society 5.0, is the source of big data that makes education more effective and efficient. In addition, the use of Education Technology (EdTech) can also support collaborative transportation and use of data. MEXT (2018) makes a leading project as a form of planning and compilation of science learning towards Society 5.0 through 3 important and essential steps, including: providing diverse opportunities and learning spaces to achieve “fair, individually optimized learning”, ensuring that all students acquire basic academic abilities such as basic reading skills, mathematical thinking, and information literacy skills, are not involved in the humanity or knowledge gap. The success of science learning can be supported by several branches of science such as Physics, Computer science, Natural science, Mathematics and modeling, Teaching and learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, STEM-based classroom management, Robotic and game teaching in science education, Instructional technology and application in science education, Training and professional development for STEM teachers, STEM curriculum in science education, Computer-based learning, Learning Innovations and Evaluation, Design and implementation of a technology-rich learning environment, Distance learning on education.</jats:p>;                <jats:p>Therefore, I thank all participants for International Conference on Science Education and Technology (ICOSETH 2019) who have contributed their research to develop Science education to face Industrial Revolution 4.0 and Society 5.0.

The emergence of Society 5.0 era demands a balance between technology and the environment. But on the other hand, the emergence of the Society 5.0 era was not matched by the formation of digital ethics in society. The rise of cybercrime cases such as the spread of fake news (hoaxes), hate speech, and cyberbullying shows the lack of digital ethics in society. The formation of digital ethics is an important thing that must be done, one of which is through digital citizenship education in society. The method used in this research is qualitative with a case study approach. Data collection was carried out through observation and in-depth interviews with several main sources, namely the community board of Kampung Cyber and community members based on purposive sampling and snowball sampling techniques. The results showed that the emergence of the Kampung Cyber community became the main forum for the implementation of digital citizenship education in society, especially in shaping ethics. The application of norms in society becomes the main control for any deviant actions in the use of technology. It takes the development of competencies and digital ethical values that are in accordance with the era of Society 5.0, such as technological literacy, responsibility, honesty, critical thinking, problem solving, creativity, equality and local wisdom. The existence of a key figure as a model in social learning will shape people's behavior according to digital ethical competencies in the era of Society 5.0. In addition, it is necessary to create a good environment and strong ties in society that will encourage the successful formation of ideal and ethical digital citizenship in the era of Society 5.0.",9,5,948,956,Nonprobability sampling; Snowball sampling; Sociology; Globalization; Ideal (ethics); Honesty; Cybercrime; Public relations; Social learning; Information ethics,,,,,https://www.hrpub.org/journals/article_info.php?aid=10847,http://dx.doi.org/10.13189/ujer.2021.090507,,10.13189/ujer.2021.090507,3162604188,,0,,0,true,cc-by,gold

In this context, task-oriented dialogue systems allow workers to delegate simple tasks to industrial assets while working on other, more complex ones. The possibility of naturally interacting with these systems reduces the cognitive demand to use them and triggers acceptation. Most modern solutions, however, do not allow a natural communication, and modern techniques to obtain such systems require large amounts of data to be trained, which is scarce in these scenarios. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents KIDE4I (Knowledge-drIven Dialogue framEwork for Industry), a semantic-based task-oriented dialogue system framework for industry that allows workers to naturally interact with industrial systems, is easy to adapt to new scenarios and does not require great amounts of data to be constructed. This work also reports the process to adapt KIDE4I to new scenarios. To validate and evaluate KIDE4I, it has been adapted to four use cases that are relevant to industrial scenarios following the described methodology, and two of them have been evaluated through two user studies. The system has been considered as accurate, useful, efficient, not demanding cognitively, flexible and fast. Furthermore, subjects view the system as a tool to improve their productivity and security while carrying out their tasks.</jats:p>",12,3,1192,1192,Computer science; Human–computer interaction; Industry 4.0; Delegate; Task (project management); Process (computing); Productivity; Context (archaeology); Knowledge management; Software engineering; Artificial intelligence,,,,Basque Government; Basque Government,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app12031192,,10.3390/app12031192,,,0,001-071-025-762-576; 004-861-332-649-536; 011-505-875-238-365; 028-235-630-548-998; 107-480-603-224-237; 110-478-672-750-754; 123-361-003-280-807; 124-921-577-345-648; 148-851-285-676-488; 157-057-676-055-759,2,true,cc-by,gold

However, working closely with a robot may lead to the creation of stressful situations for the operator, which can negatively affect task performance. In Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), robots are expected to be socially intelligent, that is, capable of understanding and reacting accordingly to human social and affective clues. This ability can be exploited implementing affective computing, which concerns the development of systems able to recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affects. Social intelligence is essential for robots to establish a natural interaction with people in several contexts, including the manufacturing sector with the emergence of Industry 5.0. In order to take full advantage of the human-robot collaboration, the robotic system should be able to perceive the psycho-emotional and mental state of the operator through different sensing modalities (e.g. facial expressions, body language, voice, or physiological signals) and to adapt its behavior accordingly. The development of socially intelligent collaborative robots in the manufacturing sector can lead to a symbiotic human-robot collaboration, arising several research challenges that still need to be addressed. The goals of this paper are the following: (i) providing an overview of affective computing implementation in HRI; (ii) analyzing the state-of-art on this topic in different application contexts (e.g. healthcare, service applications, and manufacturing); (iii) highlighting research challenges for the manufacturing sector. </jats:p>",,,95440542211218,095440542211218,Robot; Human–computer interaction; Computer science; Human–robot interaction; Affective computing; Modalities; Social robot; Process (computing); Knowledge management; Artificial intelligence,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09544054221121888,,10.1177/09544054221121888,,,0,001-296-280-070-304; 002-319-674-456-184; 002-771-875-187-970; 004-337-183-941-849; 008-417-859-083-967; 008-889-597-802-698; 010-358-528-127-296; 012-216-751-652-877; 012-603-390-719-879; 013-072-402-935-111; 013-244-367-634-046; 014-241-041-009-876; 014-408-229-090-129; 016-292-842-862-570; 016-693-057-650-297; 016-740-556-781-944; 017-740-508-081-966; 018-565-271-792-276; 019-373-212-232-893; 021-473-516-796-858; 022-834-272-454-903; 023-448-017-549-199; 023-633-111-490-861; 024-059-687-141-747; 025-470-041-898-704; 027-220-060-433-874; 028-765-061-135-402; 029-024-434-421-654; 030-997-397-302-643; 034-416-572-175-694; 038-397-803-771-413; 039-663-373-790-395; 039-921-617-495-712; 040-117-026-075-781; 044-867-867-426-652; 046-751-662-137-02X; 048-215-752-069-802; 049-783-671-957-498; 053-487-567-963-79X; 054-339-354-869-048; 055-437-409-057-465; 060-681-723-321-098; 060-880-139-042-526; 061-829-900-906-99X; 061-831-382-481-495; 062-853-759-824-595; 063-957-744-634-142; 064-138-810-036-202; 064-162-104-673-618; 066-760-188-202-831; 069-282-938-480-167; 070-348-690-453-468; 072-607-419-268-181; 072-917-825-210-712; 073-153-888-455-855; 073-516-821-339-278; 073-701-972-124-383; 074-826-226-569-466; 077-669-122-403-683; 078-297-698-497-290; 079-907-658-137-081; 081-352-942-574-997; 084-688-266-180-711; 087-157-957-268-743; 088-243-777-175-133; 092-387-701-247-302; 093-110-220-908-522; 098-150-923-941-220; 098-244-758-281-659; 100-891-688-805-138; 101-294-019-273-737; 101-555-046-927-567; 104-414-457-934-454; 105-245-349-443-692; 110-352-060-681-264; 110-981-775-298-017; 116-783-289-698-518; 121-958-933-823-475; 135-945-854-644-300; 139-556-758-250-420; 142-261-405-548-248; 162-855-446-683-474; 165-017-863-496-553; 167-148-923-567-724; 167-588-389-601-468; 174-203-266-942-821; 177-449-630-057-255; 179-717-452-517-466; 185-166-015-668-548,0,false,,

In other words, the supply chain uses technology to create integration between people, processes, and products. SMEs owners, manufacturers, and service organizations can access unprecedented, new levels of data, which can make it easy to understand, control, and improve every aspect of their operations. In the present study, existing research work on the models and assessment readiness criteria for the adoption of industry 4.0 are over-viewed. In I4.0, hybrid organizations are a type of organizations that have two wings of social and environmental mission and economic wing. The business models of these organizations have blurred the line between for-profit and non-profit organizations so that hybrid organizations can fall into both for-profit / non-profit categories. Hybrid Entrepreneurs Seek Organizational Organizations and Markets to Address Specific Social and Environmental Issues. The characteristics of these organizations are creating value for healthy living, environmental and social justice, environmental sustainability, quality products and services.

Hence, increased movement of population is taking place from rural to urban areas. But this movement is increasingly leading to the creation of peri-urban areas around major cities with underdeveloped infrastructural facilities and compromised health and sanitation services.

These core values will give spirit or motivation to everyone in the organization and finally to the community in growing a human-centered monotheistic society 5.0. This article aimed to examine the phases of implementing the Islamic value-based HR Model in companies. The model used was the HR model with Islamic values and the meaning of prayer, as well as a harmonious corporate culture, resulting in the expected HR performance. This study used qualitative research methods with the object of research are two companies that have implemented Islamic values in managing the company. The technique of collecting data was triangulation, namely research instrument,  in-depth interviews and secondary data analysis. Data analysis was inductive. The application of the Islamic value-based HR model goes through two phases, namely the ""Mecca"" phase and the ""Medina"" phase. Companies in the Mecca phase need to consistently carry out an integrated corporate culture internalization program, namely as values, decision-making patterns and attitudes. Internalization of culture by using Islamic values and the meaning of prayer to influence at the individual level, work units and companies in general can open hearts, minds and wills so that job satisfaction and employee commitment can be achieved. Companies in the Medina phase have shared values that have been entrenched and internalized which have an influence on HR performance. With the company's rapid development, culture as identity; fastener; a source of inspiration, pride and resources; driving force and as a pattern of behavior needs to be maintained and passed on to the next generation. </jats:p>",1,1,28,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.56174/pjieb.v1i1.6,,10.56174/pjieb.v1i1.6,,,0,,0,false,,

The method and approach of the research used is library research. Collection of data using documentation, i.e. from books, papers, articles, journals and so on relevant. Data analysis uses content analysis, to obtain credible inventions that can be used or researched based on context. To maintain the accuracy of the assessed and to prevent misinformation disclosed in the analysis of data, it is checked between libraries from the references used. In addition to rereading the libraries used are also very important as well as paying attention to peer comments. The results showed that the technological role in PKn-learning is very helpful to the learning process, becoming a means of creation, innovation, and self-development for independent and directional learning. PKn Interactive Learning in the Era of Industrial Revolution 4.0 helps accelerate the learning process if used wisely according to learning material needs. The use of Mobile Learning in PKn learning can optimize accuracy in capturing learning materials, comparative source means in learning materials, and able to inspire learning motivation.",8,1,36,42,Interactive Learning; Computer science; Multimedia,,,,,http://journal.ummat.ac.id/index.php/CIVICUS/article/view/1849/pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/304200660.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.31764/civicus.v8i1.1849,,10.31764/civicus.v8i1.1849,3014464277,,0,,0,true,,gold

Mouroutsos; Dimitrios Koulouriotis; Antonios Gasteratos,"<jats:p>The rise of the fourth industrial revolution aspires to digitize any traditional manufacturing process, paving the way for new organisation schemes and management principles that affect business models, the environment, and services across the entire value chain. During the last two decades, the generated advancements have been analysed and discussed from a bunch of technological and business perspectives gleaned from a variety of academic journals. With the aim to identify the digital footprint of Industry 4.0 in the current manufacturing ecosystem, a systematic literature survey of surveys is conducted here, based on survey academic articles that cover the current state-of-the-art. The 59 selected high-impact survey manuscripts are analysed using PRISMA principles and categorized according to their technologies under analysis and impact, providing valuable insights for the research and business community. Specifically, the influence Industry 4.0 exerts on traditional business models, small and medium-sized enterprises, decision-making processes, human–machine interaction, and circularity affairs are investigated and brought out, while research gaps, business opportunities, and their relevance to Industry 5.0 principles are pointed out.</jats:p>",10,9,746,746,Relevance (law); Variety (cybernetics); Systematic review; Industry 4.0; Manufacturing; Business model; Business; Knowledge management; Marketing,,,,European Commission,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/machines10090746,,10.3390/machines10090746,,,0,001-265-134-592-321; 003-913-088-984-839; 004-145-919-596-763; 004-475-276-116-659; 006-076-495-214-915; 006-617-002-106-561; 006-848-615-858-449; 009-219-509-047-252; 009-681-033-139-791; 010-191-791-723-448; 011-259-223-852-350; 011-298-009-144-582; 012-313-055-301-920; 013-287-665-466-861; 014-356-639-091-333; 014-934-290-898-725; 016-948-561-963-366; 019-026-189-807-460; 020-581-472-422-02X; 022-396-341-133-891; 025-016-433-045-559; 025-111-295-042-100; 028-528-278-772-219; 029-984-749-194-685; 030-219-829-832-189; 032-446-197-585-556; 033-541-372-628-755; 033-891-588-686-065; 038-904-037-813-023; 040-089-897-542-861; 042-151-874-988-008; 042-503-108-899-432; 043-211-916-651-410; 044-976-542-021-772; 046-446-925-840-307; 046-731-395-529-820; 047-188-377-878-829; 050-815-540-538-129; 052-178-343-401-717; 054-538-253-062-474; 058-129-365-032-761; 058-584-841-214-713; 059-327-547-420-726; 062-384-740-672-078; 063-316-150-808-125; 064-911-828-088-495; 068-356-244-846-913; 070-047-008-873-090; 074-473-632-503-437; 078-105-153-032-072; 078-697-180-365-720; 084-249-962-919-116; 088-424-854-659-039; 089-230-166-614-452; 090-218-470-242-562; 091-833-989-269-586; 099-993-498-730-415; 100-118-205-098-996; 105-672-868-849-631; 106-214-017-971-530; 109-152-233-288-638; 110-006-925-937-299; 111-197-312-287-538; 113-786-738-207-126; 113-811-562-357-842; 114-855-635-376-990; 115-442-497-162-193; 120-929-073-793-931; 124-707-104-600-736; 127-443-614-736-396; 129-475-105-628-804; 129-946-196-716-663; 134-477-067-632-705; 135-553-141-898-826; 144-790-711-872-00X; 146-473-356-444-943; 147-205-562-995-709; 150-142-202-641-838; 170-831-297-351-794; 184-899-754-144-889; 188-711-839-991-014; 188-771-360-176-100,0,true,cc-by,gold

Its efficient functioning depends on the implementation of SDG activities and the development of industry (first-fourth/fifth industrial revolution). Due to the likelihood of different priorities in the implementation of the sustainable development goals, it is important to build such relationships, e.g. in the supply chain, so that their implementation could take place under similar conditions. Digitization, or the circular economy concept (CE), create an opportunity for the SME sector to build relationships as part of industry networks, for instance, where the managed supply chain would have a common and realistic goal to achieve. This goal will be a priority in business models based on sustainable development. The article presents the results of research regarding the furniture industry in Poland (key industry, referred to as smart specialization). The results of the analysis show that the industry has a large production potential, and the natural resources used in it are constantly increasing. However, there are doubts raised by the lack of stability in the dynamics of the sold production in the industry. Ultimately, the business model of the industry supply chain should focus on the environmental aspect (sustainable management of the raw material supply chain) and on eco-friendly consumption (sustainable management of the product supply chain), so that it can be managed in a sustainable way.</jats:p>",29,3,227,234,Environmental economics; Business; Industry 4.0; Sustainable supply chain; Statistical analysis; Furniture industry; Natural resource; Sustainable development; Sustainability,,,,,https://sciendo.com/article/10.2478/mspe-2021-0028 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MSPE...29..227W/abstract https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/mspe-2021-0028 https://bazekon.uek.krakow.pl/rekord/171624158,http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/mspe-2021-0028,,10.2478/mspe-2021-0028,3176588589,,0,004-354-593-478-345; 011-053-116-114-295; 013-044-719-719-355; 018-402-956-890-614; 020-171-452-840-951; 021-315-943-430-048; 029-347-882-391-037; 041-227-869-131-490; 042-704-326-369-30X; 044-054-748-132-469; 044-968-660-415-369; 053-262-593-876-369; 060-973-085-586-626; 063-795-614-122-262; 070-621-486-013-363; 075-771-045-127-838; 081-648-774-299-190; 082-963-215-399-060; 083-685-083-819-498; 100-890-534-337-672; 101-444-577-009-739; 103-277-511-768-123; 106-645-111-629-04X; 112-538-540-416-089; 147-795-555-777-175; 148-482-715-509-006; 199-441-316-870-311,3,true,cc-by,gold

It is proved that with the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic the number of operating enterprises in Ukraine increased by 1,65%. At the same time, the number of unprofitable enterprises increased by 28,6%. Odesa oblast, Kirovohrad oblast and Kyiv are the regions most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine. It is determined that the loss of profits from the COVID-19 pandemic in large enterprises is 10-25%, and in small enterprises 25-50%. It is proved that the declining trend of profitability of operating activities of domestic enterprises accelerated further in the COVID-19 pandemic and reached 3,9% in 2020. Quarantine restrictions imposed in Ukraine led to the suspension of domestic enterprises, which faced additional problems. Among such problems are: the need to restructure the current business model of enterprises, reduce staff, increase production costs, reduce sales and other problems. It was found that smart companies did not face the problems of business organization and profitability under quarantine restrictions. Such enterprises timely fully ""digitized"" business processes based on modern information and communication technologies and other technologies of Industry 5.0; have high innovation activity; in the structure of the enterprise created its own research laboratory for the implementation of innovative developments; are energy and cost saving; constantly reduce the time of launch of a new product on the market, improve product quality. Examples of efficient and profitable domestic smart enterprises in various industries are given. For example, smart enterprises in the field of insurance increased the number of contracts concluded in Ukraine for compulsory civil liability insurance of vehicle owners in electronic form by 3,2 times compared to 2019; Retail enterprises increased the share of sales via the Internet by 2,1%, non-cash payments increased by 36% of the total retail trade in Ukraine.</jats:p>",,73,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.32843/bses.73-7,,10.32843/bses.73-7,,,0,,0,false,,
146-117-974-697-162,THE IMPACT OF NEW TRADE AGENDA TO MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF INDONESIA AND JAPAN IN SHORT AND LONG TERM,2017-10-31,2017,journal article,Buletin Ekonomi Moneter dan Perbankan,24609196; 14108046,"Bank Indonesia, Central Banking Research Department",,Amalia Adininggar Widyasanti,"The swings of global trade in recent decades have been resulted from the global economic crisis and unfavorable condition of global situation. Deterioration of private demand -- as a result of economic crisis and increase of unemployment – has been the main reason of worsening global trade. This condition has, of course, affected economic performance of countries through trade channels. Furthermore, the recent trade agenda following to Trump administration has created another uncertainty to the world economy. This paper studies the impact of new trade agenda, which is represented by Trump’s plan on trade policy, to the world economy as well as to Indonesian and Japanese economy in particular. The analysis is based on computable general equilibrium of GTAP model version 6, with two scenarios: (i) Trump Trade Agenda when implementing 45 and 35 percent tariff to China and Mexico; (ii) Trade Hit List when imposing tariff to the 16 countries in the trade hit list. Impacts of both scenarios are examined in short run and long run. The results suggest that both scenarios in the short run will not create any significant effect to global economy as whole nor to Indonesian and Japan in particular. However, their impacts to the global economy, Indonesia, and Japan will be substantial in the long run. Therefore, Indonesia and Japan in particular should concern on providing sound economic policies to reduce the risk of new trade agenda to these economies in the long run. Some policy recommendation provided in this paper are: (i) Japan should focus on improving technological innovation to realize the implementation of society 5.0 and industry 4.0 as scheduled; (ii) Indonesia should facilitate more investment to its economy and provide more government investment to induce accumulation of capital stock in the future. Furthermore, efficiencies and technological adoption should also be main concern of the Indonesian government to induce productivity of the economy and help mitigate the global risks in the long run.",20,2,181,202,Commercial policy; Economics; Trade barrier; International economics; Short run; Computable general equilibrium; World economy; Foreign direct investment; Free trade; Economic integration,,,,,https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/download/8825.pdf https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/res_display.asp?RecordID=5435 http://www.journalbankindonesia.org/index.php/BEMP/article/view/811 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/234039028.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.21098/bemp.v20i2.811,,10.21098/bemp.v20i2.811,2767024960,,0,019-646-269-458-632; 075-316-510-480-748,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

148-063-470-925-522,Digital transformation of peatland eco-innovations ('Paludiculture'): Enabling a paradigm shift towards the real-time sustainable production of 'green-friendly' products and services.,2022-05-29,2022,journal article,The Science of the total environment,18791026; 00489697,Elsevier,Netherlands,Neil J Rowan; Niall Murray; Yuansong Qiao; E O'Neill; Eoghan Clifford; Damià Barceló; Deborah M Power,"The world is heading in the wrong direction on carbon emissions where we are not on track to limit global warming to 1.5 °C; Ireland is among the countries where overall emissions have continued to rise. The development of wettable peatland products and services (termed 'Paludiculture') present significant opportunities for enabling a transition away from peat-harvesting (fossil fuels) to developing 'green' eco-innovations. However, this must be balanced with sustainable carbon sequestration and environmental protection. This complex transition from 'brown to green' must be met in real time by enabling digital technologies across the full value chain. This will potentially necessitate creation of new green-business models with the potential to support disruptive innovation. This timely paper describes digital transformation of paludiculture-based eco-innovation that will potentially lead to a paradigm shift towards using smart digital technologies to address efficiency of products and services along with future-proofing for climate change. Digital transform of paludiculture also aligns with the 'Industry 5.0 - a human-centric solution'. However, companies supporting peatland innovation may lack necessary standards, data-sharing or capabilities that can also affect viable business model propositions that can jeopardize economic, political and social sustainability. Digital solutions may reduce costs, increase productivity, improve produce develop, and achieve faster time to market for paludiculture. Digitisation also enables information systems to be open, interoperable, and user-friendly. This constitutes the first study to describe the digital transformation of paludiculture, both vertically and horizontally, in order to inform sustainability that includes process automation via AI, machine learning, IoT-Cloud informed sensors and robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and blockchain for cyber-physical systems. Thus, the aim of this paper is to describe the applicability of digital transformation to actualize the benefits and opportunities of paludiculture activities and enterprises in the Irish midlands with a global orientation.",838,Pt 3,156328,156328,Sustainability; Interoperability; Paradigm shift; Greenhouse gas; Digital transformation; Environmental economics; Digital Revolution; Business,Climate change; Digital transformation; Disruption; Natural-based solutions; Peatlands; Sustainability innovation,Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Humans; Industry; Soil,Soil,Interreg Europe,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156328,35649452,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156328,,,0,000-199-440-246-890; 003-077-460-637-876; 003-221-940-874-540; 003-734-508-497-153; 004-035-208-237-513; 004-052-595-749-061; 005-656-370-316-138; 006-115-631-054-389; 009-853-404-769-548; 010-236-953-800-634; 014-230-429-366-446; 015-481-960-493-901; 015-938-864-684-190; 017-415-713-662-955; 017-885-877-239-033; 018-291-306-971-771; 020-825-438-669-588; 021-691-489-511-284; 022-521-555-821-286; 023-701-350-507-394; 024-494-874-340-457; 024-716-790-722-969; 025-400-859-604-422; 026-084-858-769-529; 026-095-956-825-372; 026-408-094-586-607; 028-441-642-703-163; 028-809-165-996-938; 037-659-121-714-391; 037-833-584-977-519; 041-469-728-502-229; 041-892-211-741-41X; 042-096-056-677-25X; 046-562-542-091-52X; 051-497-678-798-076; 051-885-971-789-026; 052-591-552-841-013; 052-645-170-849-539; 056-791-179-270-081; 057-393-975-196-786; 058-810-636-458-981; 058-988-906-951-417; 059-356-429-761-258; 064-138-810-036-202; 064-492-707-800-120; 065-010-914-611-965; 066-932-733-337-191; 067-012-709-850-897; 068-352-266-416-553; 068-772-332-080-607; 069-819-766-532-975; 070-597-933-698-37X; 070-655-896-411-482; 071-152-974-312-669; 073-645-884-929-014; 076-110-707-101-775; 078-587-543-457-564; 079-604-164-254-167; 080-070-290-654-200; 080-504-729-503-86X; 082-093-169-349-743; 082-873-562-872-052; 086-289-108-660-714; 086-458-182-169-856; 087-982-922-387-638; 092-295-342-742-644; 092-655-468-792-272; 093-269-638-847-207; 097-500-322-356-449; 101-983-659-058-457; 102-286-835-467-181; 102-806-828-789-218; 109-271-396-864-507; 113-716-858-712-000; 116-673-114-514-767; 117-360-942-941-608; 117-642-795-346-23X; 126-257-237-474-283; 127-586-345-199-26X; 132-229-990-743-892; 134-887-710-239-93X; 135-001-594-144-079; 141-462-988-495-612; 145-313-633-857-991; 147-460-449-262-595; 155-407-272-307-336; 161-820-817-503-764; 164-931-769-098-880; 176-908-870-472-195,5,true,,hybrid

Digital transformation will create new values and is becoming a pillar of industrial policy in many countries. In anticipation of such global trends, “Society 5.0” was presented as a core concept in the 5th Science and Technology Basic Plan, adopted by the Japanese Cabinet in January 2016. It was identified as one growth strategy for Japan. Society 5.0 is also a core part of “The Investment for the Future Strategy 2017: Reform for Achieving Society 5.0” as part of its Fifth Science and Technology Basic Plan (FY16 to FY20), announced in April 2016, the Government of Japan aims to realize what it calls “Society 5.0,” or “Super Smart Society.” Society 5.0 provides a common societal infrastructure for prosperity based on an advanced service platform. The idea of progress has often been associated with modernity and social theory itself. In the bibliographical research carried out, as a curiosity the Wikipedia itself (in a consultation held on April 14, 2018) has referred to the concept of Industry 4.0, which raises interest worldwide in several, but it still does not have the concept of Society 5.0. In this paper, we can see that there is a lack of knowledge about the concept of Society 5.0. From a longitudinal perspective: “So, just what is Society 5.0? Taking a long view of history, I think we can define Society 1.0 as groups of people hunting and gathering in harmonious coexistence with nature, Society 2.0 as forming groups based on agricultural cultivation, increasing organization and Nation-building, Society 3.0 is a society that promotes industrialization through the Industrial Revolution, making mass production possible, and Society 4.0 as an information society that realizes increasing added value by connecting intangible assets as information networks. Society 5.0 is an information society built upon Society 4.0, aiming for a prosperous human-centered society.” Society 5.0 achieves a high degree of convergence between cyberspace (virtual space) and physical space (real space). In the past information society (Society 4.0), people would access a cloud service (databases) in cyberspace via the Internet and search for, retrieve, and analyze information or data. In Society 5.0, a huge amount of information from sensors in physical space is accumulated in cyberspace. In cyberspace, this big data is analyzed by artificial intelligence (AI), and the analysis results are fed back to humans in physical space in various forms. In the past information society, the common practice was to collect information via the network and have it analyzed by humans. In Society 5.0, however, people, things, and systems are all connected in cyberspace and optimal results obtained by AI exceeding the capabilities of humans are fed back to physical space. This process brings new value to industry and society in ways not previously possible. It is a presentation that is based on very recent publications, but which also has a prospective component, which always generates some in determination and uncertainty. Also, for this reason, it is a contribution that seeks above all else to contribute to this very urgent and necessary discussion.",10,2,1,6,Digital transformation; Political science; Prosperity; Industry 4.0; Information society; Cyberspace; Public relations; Industrialisation; Information and Communications Technology; Big data,,,,,https://www.hilarispublisher.com/abstract/japanrsquos-society-50-going-beyond-industry-40-33082.html https://www.hilarispublisher.com/open-access/japanrsquos-society-50-going-beyond-industry-40.pdf,https://www.hilarispublisher.com/abstract/japanrsquos-society-50-going-beyond-industry-40-33082.html,,,3119880852,,0,,7,false,,

Fernández-Caramés,"Industry 5.0 follows the steps of the Industry 4.0 paradigm and seeks for revolutionizing the way industries operate. In fact, Industry 5.0 focuses on research and innovation to support industrial production sustainability and place the well-being of industrial workers at the center of the production process. Thus, Industry 5.0 relies on three pillars: it is human-centric, it encourages sustainability and it is aimed at developing resilience against disruptions. Such core aspects cannot be fully achieved without a transparent end-to-end human-centered traceability throughout the value chain. As a consequence, Auto-Identification (Auto-ID) technologies play a key role, since they are able to provide automated item recognition, positioning and tracking without human intervention or in cooperation with industrial operators. Although the most popular Auto-ID technologies provide a certain degree of security and productivity, there are still open challenges for future Industry 5.0 factories. This article analyzes and evaluates the Auto-ID landscape and delivers a holistic perspective and understanding of the most popular and the latest technologies, looking for solutions that cope with harsh, diverse and complex industrial scenarios. In addition, it describes a methodology for selecting Auto-ID technologies for Industry 5.0 factories. Such a methodology is applied to a specific use case of the shipbuilding industry that requires identifying the main components of a ship during its construction and repair. To validate the outcomes of the methodology, a practical evaluation of passive and active UHF RFID tags was performed in an Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV) under construction, showing that a careful selection and evaluation of the tags enables product identification and tracking even in areas with a very high density of metallic objects. As a result, this article serves as a useful guide for industrial stakeholders, including future developers and managers that seek for deploying identification and traceability technologies in Industry 5.0 scenarios.",9,,140700,140730,Value chain; Engineering management; Traceability; Productivity; Resilience (network); Computer science; Shipbuilding; Sustainability; Identification (information); Industrial production,,,,"Auto-Identification for Intelligent Products Research Line of the Navantia-Universidade da Coruña Joint Research Unit; Centro de Investigación de Galicia ‘‘CITIC,’’ funded by Xunta de Galicia and the European Union",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9568924/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/access/access9.html#Fraga-LamasVF21,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/access.2021.3119775,,10.1109/access.2021.3119775,3207468962,,0,001-278-005-207-805; 001-546-860-043-918; 004-166-427-330-988; 005-009-895-542-778; 005-120-454-948-399; 006-401-754-649-451; 006-473-931-536-785; 006-597-493-672-65X; 008-901-499-326-236; 009-319-552-038-229; 009-811-414-488-648; 010-678-180-101-919; 010-972-533-756-45X; 012-980-074-133-335; 013-906-709-625-300; 014-005-608-022-509; 015-376-955-790-27X; 015-379-736-621-533; 015-904-952-310-302; 017-992-423-449-064; 019-127-221-119-979; 019-507-714-158-41X; 020-411-988-724-22X; 021-381-653-186-206; 022-940-214-318-814; 024-216-957-807-956; 024-759-937-247-438; 025-016-433-045-559; 025-812-684-521-30X; 028-468-987-605-219; 028-878-826-824-156; 029-500-643-247-60X; 030-153-628-264-104; 030-454-393-823-694; 030-596-147-948-081; 032-669-882-780-518; 033-922-553-502-499; 034-456-604-262-749; 034-756-651-364-224; 035-001-577-402-886; 035-980-512-441-018; 036-966-645-054-578; 038-520-662-449-164; 040-155-961-291-028; 041-354-227-907-615; 041-428-887-893-385; 041-619-870-618-354; 042-093-217-014-059; 046-088-451-219-238; 047-081-220-569-112; 047-332-984-826-186; 047-501-098-246-691; 049-992-401-043-662; 050-132-665-727-967; 050-255-293-285-52X; 051-725-650-520-728; 052-224-103-560-692; 052-390-775-001-328; 052-494-377-392-470; 053-397-444-734-488; 054-456-489-723-014; 055-750-444-809-889; 056-073-085-085-970; 056-870-976-321-182; 059-888-951-393-15X; 060-837-277-507-922; 063-267-317-875-891; 063-464-410-845-817; 064-027-231-154-130; 066-453-436-263-175; 067-101-261-890-173; 067-720-682-234-265; 068-285-232-144-871; 070-095-101-153-65X; 070-443-361-568-040; 070-988-548-518-983; 072-866-616-899-739; 074-208-995-036-260; 074-922-158-294-244; 075-119-075-675-854; 075-996-258-734-495; 082-377-263-801-104; 082-499-278-147-374; 087-809-166-122-677; 088-281-655-337-496; 089-546-495-818-57X; 094-470-848-660-142; 094-605-271-493-575; 095-415-504-907-329; 096-939-794-456-629; 097-251-112-529-343; 099-512-497-462-340; 099-984-216-091-666; 101-492-691-728-717; 102-368-937-447-332; 105-325-269-383-124; 108-613-585-717-080; 109-714-723-126-043; 110-336-541-237-666; 111-060-687-206-768; 111-243-882-085-06X; 112-065-907-512-820; 112-092-847-584-112; 113-580-898-517-445; 118-897-021-077-022; 121-609-557-812-186; 127-492-767-676-786; 135-317-873-756-837; 137-151-051-197-074; 140-831-046-514-167; 141-142-753-807-009; 141-197-464-395-341; 142-097-324-189-026; 142-499-916-630-147; 142-884-955-765-627; 143-622-521-619-91X; 143-947-051-557-480; 150-233-135-089-265; 152-712-839-538-824; 154-291-711-271-876; 156-182-043-768-747; 161-314-741-186-763; 162-854-426-677-97X; 164-180-530-939-997; 172-328-304-723-678; 173-061-938-041-130; 179-974-650-785-864; 181-538-214-596-312; 189-894-145-764-360,9,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

Students are more likely to be introduced to the basic concepts of ethnoscience without involving how to integrate ethnoscience into science learning. The impact is that students’ scientific literacy is low. This is what underlies researchers to apply the Local Wisdom Integrated Science (LWIS) learning model by using local Madurese content to train students’ scientific literacy. The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in student scientific literacy after implementing the LWIS learning model in ethnoscience learning with local Madurese content. The method used was pre-experimental study with one group pretest-posttest design. When the study was carried out in the even semester of the 2019/2020 academic year by taking 22 students via purposive sampling technique as a sample of all students in class 6A of science education, Trunojoyo University, Madura. Analysis of data using descriptive statistics and paired sample t test. The results showed that there were different in the scientific literacy of the students using the LWIS learning model before and after studying ethnoscience with local Madurese material. The entire LWIS syntax helps train students' scientific literacy by including self-awareness of the importance of local Madurese content as a learning context. Ethnoscience can be integrated into science learning through the STEAM approach. The contribution of STEAM to the LWIS learning model and self-awareness is very significant in developing ethnoscience learning for local Madurese content from elementary, middle, and tertiary level.",7,2,103,112,Nonprobability sampling; Mathematics education; Psychology; Class (computer programming); Ethnoscience; Context (language use); Descriptive statistics; Science education; Literacy; Scientific literacy,,,,,https://journal.trunojoyo.ac.id/penasains/article/view/8445 https://journal.trunojoyo.ac.id/penasains/article/download/8445/LWIS%20Model https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/348690269.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.21107/jps.v7i2.8445,,10.21107/jps.v7i2.8445,3096010399,,0,,0,true,cc-by,gold

Starting from the preliminary study already realized on the different user-robot collaboration categorizations present in the literature (Formati et al, 2021), the new contribution, through the review of the still insufficient regulatory framework, ergonomic factors and robotic systems existing in the manufacturing field, returns the definition of further specifications about the collaboration modalities. In the current technological ecosystem, through the discipline of design is possible to prefigure and reinforce the collaborative processes through the introduction of new protocols and tools to support the regulatory standards, synthesis and evolution of the investigated categorizations, in order to optimize the production system as a whole and improve the working conditions of the operator with the robotic systems in terms of predictability, reliability, and usability.</jats:p>",,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.54941/ahfe1001653,,10.54941/ahfe1001653,,,0,,0,false,,

The inclusion of human interaction with digital realities, extended reality (XR) technologies, such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), can play an essential role in Industry 5.0. While rapid advances in XR technologies are solidifying and finding their place in the product and production development process, terminology and classification scheme remain under-determined. As a result, there have been numerous classifications of XR technologies from different perspectives, but little widespread agreement. They have been classified by their level of immersion or how well they meet a specific purpose (such as training). In addition to that, the classifications are usually made for one particular field (e.g. marketing, healthcare, engineering, architecture, among others). Therefore, to set the basis for future research, it is essential to identify and outline the dimensions that intervene in product and production design in regards to XR facilitated collaboration. With the ideas proposed in this paper, we want to identify basic concepts that classify a collaborative XR system by analyzing how users interact with the environment and other users.

C. Ng; Takayuki Hirose; Hideki Nomoto,"<jats:p>Globalization and mass customization are commonly translated into increased levels of complexity in manufacturing systems. One of the main reasons is the increased number of variables, parameters, and interrelations on the shop floor. This intrinsic complexity can grow exponentially when considering the manufacture of large-size products with high levels of variability and variants: the mass production of large recreational motorboats with high levels of customization and low production volumes, mass customization. With the increasing role of sustainability and concepts of Industry 5.0, focusing not just on improving production systems but also human wellbeing, quick decision making becomes essential. Data and digitalization are becoming the cornerstone for system improvement, and digital data availability and analysis can facilitate the utilization of computerized tools to support decision making and maximize the performance of complex systems. For that purpose, simulation can be a powerful analytical tool to design, maintain, and improve complex manufacturing systems. Simulation techniques usually allow handling the size and complexity commonly associated with manufacturing systems. However, in systems with highly customized and large-size products, manual processes, and limited floor space, the implementation of simulation techniques is not straightforward, especially considering the aspects of variability, data collection, model validation, and system reconfiguration. With a particular focus on large-size products and limitations of a constrained existing facility layout, this paper presents the implementation of a simulation-based reconfiguration assessment considering manual production, assembly, and internal logistics requirements. Going through an industrial case study of large recreational motorboats manufacturing, the paper analyses the system analysis, data collection, implementation, and validation of the methodology step by step. Considering different what-if scenarios, the focus is on the capacity reconfiguration using Discrete-Event Simulation. The results can serve as a guideline for decision-makers and stakeholders working with complex mass customization manufacturing systems and space-constrained facility layouts.</jats:p>",,,,,Mass customization; Control reconfiguration; Computer science; Production (economics); Industrial engineering; Product (mathematics); Personalization; Raw data; Systems engineering; Manufacturing engineering,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/atde220130,,10.3233/atde220130,,,0,,0,true,,gold

Indonesian citizens share the suffering of the disaster and their experience through the news. However, Indonesian media reports the news of forest fire in a different way related to their respective media agendas and the adoption of Industry 5.0 cultures. The study of news construction of mass media on forest fires is crucial because it relates to government policymaking. This research aims to determine the media agenda in constructing forest fires that occur in Indonesia related to the development of Industry 5.0. It applies a mixed-method of qualitative content analysis of published news during October 2019-January 2020 and newsroom ethnography of three national online news media. Media agenda-setting factors observed in univariate analysis are news focus, news sources, forest fire-prevention, the impact of a forest fire, and the event of a forest fire. This paper is a working paper and has not yet concluded the results because it needs further investigation on newsroom ethnography.

It contributes to the in-depth development of the noosphere, the emergence of new industries and a qualitative transformation of production and distribution relations. The paper examines the impact of digitalization on transformational changes in the economy. As noted at the 14th G20 Summit, the main goals of digitalization are the development of innovations, focused on the development of society 5.0, ensuring the free flow of data and at the same time solving problems, related to information security and the protection of intellectual property rights, as well as bridging the digital gap and promoting the digitalization of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and the development of smart cities.&#x0D;; The research methodology is based on theoretical and methodological analysis of the literature, statistical, comparative analysis, as well as synthesis, generalization and systems analysis.&#x0D;; The study has revealed differences between the national approach and world experience in the interpretation of digitalization. For instance, in Ukraine the phenomenon involves, first of all, «digitization» in the field of data collection and analysis. At the same time, the concept of digitalization in developed countries is considered as the modernization of the manufacturing sector based on the implementation of information and communication technologies in order to reduce the capital and material intensity of products to increase competitiveness. In addition, the level of development of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) as one of the indicators of the information society has been analyzed. As a result, it was found, that about 80 % of all central banks in the world have been working on projects to issue their own digital currency. The basic requirements for national CBDC have been systematized.&#x0D;; The practical significance, presented in the paper, lies in making recommendations for policy implementation of national economy digitalization. It is important, first of all, to «digitize» the real manufacturing sector, but not only create all sorts of «remote access services», clearly define the government position on cryptocurrencies and continue to implement the project of e-hryvnia (digital currency of National Bank of Ukraine) introduction.</jats:p>",6,4(62),,,Information society; Digitization; Economic system; Informatization; Digital economy; Transformational leadership; Modernization theory; Industry 4.0; Digital transformation; Business; Industrial organization; Economy; Economics,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.15587/2706-5448.2021.248124,,10.15587/2706-5448.2021.248124,,,0,,0,true,cc-by,gold

To maintain production and adjust quickly to technological transformation, innovative work-based learning approaches are emphasized. Intelligent machines are becoming capable of interaction and collaboration with humans. They not only introduce a new type of learnable workforce to manufacturing but may open opportunities to enhance learning of all learners. Symbiotic relationships of humans and machines have wide potential for human-centric manufacturing (aka Industry 5.0). Moreover, connecting smart devices and deploying self-learning solutions is envisioned to increase flexibility of manufacturing, thus changing work division between humans and machines. Where humans and machines collaborate, the term Reciprocal Learning has been coined to describe the process of bidirectional learning. While a definition of Reciprocal Learning exists the boundary conditions of the concept are still ambiguous. In this paper, a framework for Reciprocal Learning in Human-Machine Collaboration for Industry 5.0 is presented to clarify what it is and what it isn’t. The approach is based on a multi-agent system perspective, comprising human and machine agents. Finally, an outlook on future research is presented.</jats:p>",,,207,225,Flexibility (engineering); Reciprocal; Workforce; Computer science; Industry 4.0; Artificial intelligence; Manufacturing; Knowledge management; Process (computing); Engineering; Human–computer interaction,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.30844/wagb_2022_11,,10.30844/wagb_2022_11,,,0,,0,false,,

Balashova,"<jats:p>The research objective of the present article is to study new world trends in industrial deve¬lopment and the reaction speed of national governments, companies and workers to technological changes. As research methods, analysis and synthesis of current world trends were applied, as well as special methods were used: expert assessments of international organizations were analyzed, a comparative and economic-statistical analysis was carried out. As a result, the distinctive features of Industry 5.0 are highlighted – this is the coexistence of industry and new social and environmental trends and needs. Change is inevitable: green energy and sustainable products will initially be a monopoly factor and benefit insiders. It is emphasized that in order to achieve global competitiveness, companies need to transform established business models and invest in technology and network forms of business, taking into account social goals: in addition to creating new jobs and ensuring flexible employment, we are talking about personalization of goods and greening. The poli¬tical and economic goals of the fifth industrial revolution and the direction of technological innovations are considered. It is emphasized that technology, according to the new approach, should serve people and society, which means that the technology used in production adapts to the needs and diversity of industry workers. The leaders are artificial intelligence, quantum information and semiconductors. Technological transformation is based on the development of the following areas: individual technologies for human-machine interaction, biotechnology and smart materials, artificial intelligence, digital twins, data transmission, storage and analysis technologies, as well as energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, storage and autonomy. It is an ecosystem-based innovation policy with a flexible focus on results. It is noted that technological transformation will help solve a number of unique social problems. It puts a bold focus from individual technologies to a system approach that allows the industry to achieve social goals beyond job creation and growth, and puts the well-being of industry workers at the center of the production process. In conclusion, the techno-social nature of the fifth revolution is revealed, with technology as tools and social needs as the ultimate goal.</jats:p>",22,2,141,147,Industrial organization; Technological revolution; Diversity (politics); Digital transformation; Business; Technological change; Order (exchange); Sustainable development; Competitive advantage; Big data; Economics; Marketing,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.14529/ctcr220213,,10.14529/ctcr220213,,,0,,0,true,,gold

In terms of focus and topics selected for the PBL experiences, it is necessary to put forward the relevance of global challenges and to nurture a compromise for sustainability and ethical behaviour, while bringing students as close as possible to real multifaceted engineering problems. As regards connections with other educational methodologies, PBL and service learning (SL) are bound to hybridization and may benefit from innovative approaches, like the use of flipped classrooms, the promotion of gamification or the support of online resources and e-/b-/m-learning tools and methods. Complete PBL experiences will also synergize with and contribute to open-source engineering movements, like the “makers” movement, and will benefit from open software and hardware tools for increased educational equity. This chapter analyses and discusses trends in PBL methodologies, in connection with these new industrial and educational paradigms.</jats:p>",,,,,Transformative learning; Project-based learning; Engineering education; Service-learning; Engineering ethics; Promotion (chess); Engineering; Equity (law); Nature versus nurture; Compromise; Engineering management; Computer science,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.102844,,10.5772/intechopen.102844,,,0,125-795-343-058-314; 136-036-567-993-098,0,true,,hybrid

A Cross-Country Empirical Analysis",2022-01-01,2022,book chapter,Advances in Sustainability Science and Technology,26626829; 26626837,Springer Singapore,,Aura Domil; Valentin Burca; Oana Bogdan,"Over time, industrial revolutions have marked human existence and the work environment, impacting efficiency, effectiveness, and productivity. In the new promoted concept, Industry 5.0, it is expected that humans interact with robots, known as cobots, in a collaborative working space using innovative technologies. This chapter brings some new insights on the way the components of Industry 5.0 readiness model influence value added reported by countries, for the period between 2017 and 2019, on four levels of analysis, namely: (i) country gross value added; (ii) environmental activities value added; (iii) ICT sector value added; (iv) labour productivity. Our results prove that selected components of the Industry 5.0 readiness model determine a positive marginal effect on the value added reported by countries. We also registered a significant influence on the development of the circular economy, in strong relation with the development of the knowledge economy. This highlights the fact that the results of the research are efficiently implemented on manufacturing operations by highly skilled employees, leading to increase firms’ performance, improving at the same time the cooperation between humans and smart machines, as stated in the Industry 5.0 framework.KeywordsHuman-centric approachSustainable developmentIndustry 5.0Economic assessmentResilienceFactor analysisReadiness IndexEnvironmental value addedLabour productivity",,,233,256,Productivity; Value (mathematics); Industrial organization; Added value; Index (typography); Business; Work (physics); Perspective (graphical); Industry 4.0; Economics,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-7365-8_9,,10.1007/978-981-16-7365-8_9,,,0,001-395-188-545-307; 002-398-645-119-451; 005-609-792-919-05X; 007-997-484-072-926; 010-191-791-723-448; 017-415-713-662-955; 017-690-014-022-445; 022-364-586-886-756; 024-845-525-387-208; 030-885-939-483-658; 031-827-047-258-990; 034-191-620-199-646; 044-257-323-155-323; 044-976-542-021-772; 049-816-999-056-296; 065-776-376-781-367; 067-715-932-083-994; 071-973-445-852-166; 079-330-047-262-55X; 080-645-998-976-111; 100-124-216-391-558; 102-024-085-249-950; 103-000-517-608-073; 103-127-499-232-604; 106-174-712-124-858; 140-933-913-297-672; 146-346-698-365-266; 151-367-882-448-620; 152-325-633-965-046; 153-133-342-515-563,2,false,,

The researchers investigated how an educator can utilize artificial intelligence and optimize it into a STEM-based learning process. STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math. The United States initiated it to combine the four disciplines integrated into a problem-based learning method and everyday contextual events. Artificial intelligence is an intelligence added to a system managed in a scientific context. Artificial intelligence is created and put into a machine (computer) to do work like humans. Several fields that use artificial intelligence include expert systems, computer games (games), fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks, and robotics. The researchers employed the literature review or library research by reviewing the results of various studies and collecting data from assorted references and sources. In conclusion, implementing artificial intelligence in STEM-based creative learning can be an alternative for an educator in the learning process. Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to help educators in the creative learning process by implementing long-life education and showing behavioral changes in a better direction cognitively, affectively, and psychometrically, especially in the era of society 5.0.</jats:p>",6,2,433,440,Artificial intelligence; Process (computing); Context (archaeology); Computer science,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.24042/tadris.v6i2.10135,,10.24042/tadris.v6i2.10135,,,0,,0,true,cc-by-sa,gold

Literasi Indonesia,,null Muhammad Ihsaan Rizqulloh,"<jats:p>Business digitization is the change of communication, interaction, and business functions to digital. In business applications, digitization changes the business processes, functions, and business models applied to digital technology. One of the most successful ways to deal with the digital revolution is business digitization in the 5.0 society era. The concept of society 5.0 is related to the National Economic Recovery, which aims to build a human-centered society where economic development and problem-solving can be achieved. The role of business digitization during the Covid-19 pandemic is very influential on the Indonesian economy, especially for government programs that have used digital systems and supported Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). This study uses a qualitative descriptive approach, using secondary data obtained from the Central Statistics Agency, journals, books, and other sources relevant to the research. Based on the research results, there is a very significant change in business digitization in the era of society 5.0, where digital business is more promising than conventional concepts.</jats:p>",1,2,120,126,Digitization; Agency (philosophy); Unemployment; Government (linguistics); Business model; Business; Business process,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.47540/ijqr.v1i2.366,,10.47540/ijqr.v1i2.366,,,0,,1,true,cc-by-sa,hybrid

Malaria is one of the oldest pandemics and still causing numerous deaths. Normally there is surge in the cases once the rainy season comes and it continues little over the rainy season. Normally multi-regression analysis-based empirical models have used to model the incidence and the rainfall, temperature, and relative humidity. Though the models developed were useful for public health departments, they often gave less accurate results than desired, and a need was felt to explore data science for a non-parametric solution. In this study we employed machine learning-based approaches and evaluated the results. The data came from Sundargarh District of the province of Odisha, India. Climate data used in the study include (1) block-wise station rainfall (RF) observation data, (2) gridded surface temperature (T2) data, and (3) Relative humidity (RH) data. High resolution gridded (with a horizontal resolution of 0.1°) ECMWF reanalysis land (ERA5-Land) data were used for observed temperature and relative humidity. The rainfall data was sourced from the Special Relief Commissioners’ web portal in Odisha. Malaria incidence data were collected from the state's Directorate of Public Health. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and J48 algorithm of Machine Learning were used to successfully predict malaria incidents. The two techniques’ performance evaluation was done using the classifier accuracy, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Kappa, and ROC scores. Classifier techniques such as the tenfold cross-validation and Percentile split (66%) and user-defined test options were used to divide the data into a training set and testing set. The study found out that the prediction accuracy in tenfold cross-validation with J48 decision tree classifiers was generally higher than the MLP. The results were encouraging, especially for the potential utilization of the model to predict future malaria incidence with higher confidence with access to weather forecasts. It was established that there is a medium-level malaria incidence in Odisha during periods of low rainfall, medium temperature, and lower relative humidity. Medium rain, high temperature, and low relative humidity are also associated with medium cases of malaria. Also, high temperatures, higher rainfall, and low relative humidity are characterized by a medium level of malaria incidence. Most importantly, it was established that high malaria incidence is associated with high or medium rainfall, low or medium temperature, and medium or very high relative humidity.KeywordsMachine learningMultilayer perceptron (MLP)J48 algorithmSpatial epidemiologyGIS for healthClimateHealth",,,165,197,Geography; Machine learning; Environmental science,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-9476-9_9,,10.1007/978-981-16-9476-9_9,,,0,003-503-688-633-520; 004-686-677-261-662; 006-221-469-547-271; 007-182-469-611-680; 010-115-613-249-654; 011-094-413-122-268; 014-235-948-497-344; 017-357-600-189-978; 018-543-341-977-173; 018-875-886-117-115; 024-240-843-412-964; 024-516-902-244-222; 026-546-180-872-402; 032-369-567-944-08X; 034-519-119-843-924; 035-063-468-948-752; 036-585-376-442-628; 038-648-202-823-568; 040-432-986-883-233; 047-558-132-917-485; 049-118-681-886-443; 051-766-494-380-890; 052-046-360-026-758; 055-455-785-047-980; 058-798-994-947-751; 058-853-690-617-840; 062-044-034-471-155; 062-866-636-340-294; 063-452-659-455-832; 065-992-858-104-058; 066-455-391-863-861; 069-463-248-180-418; 074-645-394-887-495; 087-455-315-205-578; 089-994-789-817-141; 091-762-640-524-69X; 099-010-186-686-590; 099-899-160-525-317; 105-953-539-446-488; 112-295-760-165-716; 116-105-301-791-940; 124-651-129-451-773; 126-609-710-536-58X; 129-177-304-679-991; 135-956-570-972-453; 136-532-178-114-005; 140-296-563-965-087; 146-446-682-779-446,0,false,,

Nowadays, several authors discuss the need to bring workers back to the center of the decision-making about implementing the new technologies in what is being called Industry 5.0 (I5.0). A key factor of using these new concepts is that it must make sense, and the new information generated by these technologies must have a precise use; otherwise, it will be considered waste. The Lean approach is already recognized as the best approach to identify and eliminate waste from production systems. Not only that, but it allows decisions about process improvement to be human-centric. Thus, this article aims to present the main aspects and evolution of I4.0 and I5.0 over time, using the Lean approach as the analysis lenses.&#x0D;; Study design/methodology/approach: In order to identify the mains aspects of I4.0 and I5.0, we develop a consistent literature review using the Systematic Search Flow (SSF).&#x0D;; Findings: As a result, it was possible to identify the evolution from I4.0 to I5.0, In I4.0, the main focus was on developing new technologies, combine them with classic Lean tools (e.g. Kanban 4.0, Poka-Yoke 4.0) and implement Cyber-Physical Systems. In I5.0, the focus is to use these new technologies together with shop floor workers to continuously improve production processes. Not only that, but in I5.0, the protagonist becomes (or return to become) the shop floor workers to lead the improvements, as is in the Toyota Kata approach.&#x0D;; Originality/value: This work presents a new way of interpreting the progression of concepts from I4.0 to I5.0. In addition, the focus on workers for problem solving is returning to the center of the discussion. Together with the technologies of I4.0, this represents a new area for future research.</jats:p>",11,,,,Industry 4.0; Kanban; Lean manufacturing; Cyber-physical system; Emerging technologies; Computer science; Process (computing); Production (economics); Perspective (graphical); Process management; Focus (optics); Knowledge management; Engineering; Manufacturing engineering,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.53615/2232-5697.11.145-155,,10.53615/2232-5697.11.145-155,,,0,,1,true,cc-by-sa,gold

This has two implications: (1) the further advancement and evolution of knowledge and innovation are requiring a co-evolution with democracy or knowledge democracy, and (2) ecology, ecological sensitivity, and environmental protection are a necessity for the survival of humanity, but they should also be regarded as drivers for further knowledge production and innovation development. This implies that for an innovation system to be a Quadruple and Quintuple Helix Innovation System, the government and the political system, addressing the innovation system, must be democratic in substance, and not only in form. This indicates how a Quadruple and Quintuple Helix differs from Triple Helix approaches to innovation. Furthermore, within the framework of Quadruple and Quintuple Helix, the “Democracy of Climate” for innovation and the “Democracy of Knowledge” are combined together in creating a nexus. Implications for strategy, policy, and practice are manifold, also incorporating aspects of Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0.",,,1,30,Triple helix; Neoclassical economics; Helix; Nexus (standard); Government; Economics; Political system; Innovation system; Democracy; Entrepreneurship,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-021-00813-x,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-021-00813-x,,,3177023060,,0,000-822-603-173-465; 002-769-430-371-000; 003-623-061-566-332; 006-037-296-021-481; 006-458-937-938-122; 007-971-265-021-699; 008-880-163-041-448; 010-162-760-623-206; 011-878-922-944-695; 012-750-062-281-425; 013-085-946-745-001; 014-396-351-330-266; 014-408-859-245-463; 015-098-569-195-264; 015-365-120-464-050; 015-438-738-495-734; 016-614-622-441-095; 017-371-122-099-089; 017-415-713-662-955; 018-225-989-657-232; 018-282-224-169-000; 019-531-458-043-997; 028-028-892-088-002; 033-944-614-999-433; 034-783-839-685-525; 036-285-006-299-516; 038-655-340-251-727; 038-846-644-231-911; 040-252-352-426-753; 040-778-348-220-273; 041-437-717-635-476; 043-434-429-197-466; 044-385-421-528-476; 045-683-618-122-316; 047-946-263-596-778; 049-514-992-846-857; 051-969-308-907-346; 051-975-164-698-08X; 051-996-378-965-713; 052-750-868-077-299; 056-049-545-647-082; 059-009-932-291-672; 062-223-632-958-151; 064-911-828-088-495; 065-768-850-650-365; 067-256-259-033-371; 067-657-975-259-248; 073-123-784-675-864; 075-639-472-070-33X; 075-742-629-719-738; 076-573-165-380-300; 078-095-766-223-262; 079-243-720-152-380; 079-263-307-315-834; 079-919-116-621-379; 080-889-748-635-876; 086-026-667-468-927; 087-262-281-823-616; 089-187-658-916-00X; 091-928-035-899-634; 093-779-978-973-429; 098-807-165-934-454; 100-549-579-714-540; 102-209-767-634-670; 102-458-672-600-731; 102-861-736-374-631; 105-506-827-634-796; 109-279-999-636-550; 109-778-713-586-989; 110-459-268-431-213; 110-545-874-743-074; 113-724-467-093-61X; 114-423-455-829-244; 116-328-367-735-253; 117-357-964-775-519; 118-879-792-570-641; 119-730-544-716-817; 120-094-718-338-889; 124-068-342-141-899; 125-601-357-301-698; 125-795-343-058-314; 132-333-206-400-256; 133-607-804-091-774; 134-548-748-198-735; 134-588-663-182-60X; 135-038-723-068-121; 135-553-141-898-826; 137-894-769-087-410; 137-990-144-076-885; 138-332-915-687-580; 146-038-040-082-222; 150-661-354-927-688; 155-920-474-732-40X; 158-070-665-594-661; 160-606-043-902-329; 168-732-857-851-354; 170-049-396-285-999; 172-812-948-733-729; 173-118-643-332-904; 175-785-932-198-352; 179-589-522-413-475,0,false,,

Research),2411796x; 20794665,Publishing House Science,,Коринна Сергеевна Костюкова,"Purpose: this article includes the review of the Japanese policy on the national economy Digital Transformation, using the case of implementation of artificial intelligence for production and services, description and analysis of the current results, as well as identification of obstacles to achieve the expected results. Methods: the article is based on the analysis of scientific and analytical materials to the problem of research. The factual basis is the framework documents of the Cabinet of Japan, media, reports on research conducted by Japanese research institutes. Results: the article provides a brief review and analysis of the Japanese public policy of the development of AI technology, summarizes the interim results of the measures taken, identifies problematic factors that prevent the achievement of the expected results. The hypothesis is put forward about the insufficiency of government efforts to monitor and analyze the activities already implemented, the lack of practice of taking into account failures in the formation of new programs and projects. Recently, significant attention to the development of AI technology is paid in Russia. In 2019, Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the ""National strategy for the development of AI until 2030"". It is expected that the using of digital technologies, will increase the competitiveness of the national economy, improve the welfare of society. In this regard, the study of Japan's experience as one of the technological leaders in the development and using of digital transformation, is especially important. Conclusions and Relevance: To solve the current socio-economic problems, Japan government relies on the development of the advanced technologies. At the same time, the government continues to develop measures to stimulate the cooperation of the academic and industrial sectors to conduct joint R&D on priority technologies. However, due to the ""closed"" nature of Japanese corporations and the relative independence of government plans in determining the technological priorities development, the corporate sector is reluctant to follow government recommendations on the using new technologies in management and production processes, as well as joint projects with the academic sector are not large-scale and are rather formal. This situation indicates the continuing unpreparedness of key NIS participants for the perception of the advanced technologies and digital transformation.",10,4,516,529,Public policy; Digital transformation; Business sector; Government; Political science; Cabinet (file format); Emerging technologies; Interim; Abenomics; Public relations,,,,,https://www.mir-nayka.com/jour/article/view/976 https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/politika-tsifrovoy-transformatsiya-yaponii-na-primere-razvitiya-tehnologii-iskusstvennogo-intellekta https://www.mir-nayka.com/jour/article/download/976/868 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/276535669.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.18184/2079-4665.2019.10.4.516-529,,10.18184/2079-4665.2019.10.4.516-529,2997915297,,0,007-343-070-457-970; 009-429-491-311-662; 013-282-220-731-906; 033-478-777-808-480; 065-454-644-476-405; 068-165-609-347-454; 081-810-499-687-924; 085-371-017-012-953; 095-773-535-256-100; 096-150-888-610-596; 105-606-187-469-603; 116-204-232-173-244; 121-773-274-862-508; 152-408-964-038-240,2,true,cc-by,gold

The manufacturing industry is currently moving towards the integration of productivity enhancements and sustainable human employment. Such a transformation has deeply changed the human–machine interaction (HMI), among which digital twin (DT) and extended reality (XR) are two cutting-edge technologies. A manufacturing DT offers an opportunity to simulate, monitor, and optimize the machine. In the meantime, XR empowers HMI in the industrial field. This paper presents an XR application framework for DT-based services within a manufacturing context. This work aims to develop a technological framework to improve the efficiency of the XR application development and the usability of the XR-based HMI systems. We first introduce four layers of the framework, including the perception layer with the physical machine and its ROS-based simulation model, the machine communication layer, the network layer containing three kinds of communication middleware, and the Unity-based service layer creating XR-based digital applications. Subsequently, we conduct the responsiveness test for the framework and describe several XR industrial applications for a DT-based smart crane. Finally, we highlight the research challenges and potential issues that should be further addressed by analyzing the performance of the whole framework.</jats:p>",12,12,6030,6030,Industry 4.0; Computer science; Context (archaeology); Digital transformation; Middleware (distributed applications); Application layer; Manufacturing engineering; Engineering; Systems engineering,,,,Business Finland,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app12126030,,10.3390/app12126030,,,0,001-501-694-057-716; 004-085-738-535-206; 004-420-242-506-255; 005-912-139-679-809; 006-892-043-785-704; 009-851-433-625-819; 013-961-199-230-836; 014-206-084-650-088; 017-415-713-662-955; 019-377-897-064-068; 020-250-142-306-281; 021-473-871-108-925; 024-294-681-700-659; 029-369-428-965-288; 032-273-512-707-734; 035-358-475-696-790; 042-139-189-848-822; 046-727-219-981-488; 048-092-008-205-493; 051-794-592-567-825; 052-219-484-209-348; 056-667-310-722-226; 058-724-297-052-90X; 059-424-427-267-469; 061-458-859-607-380; 061-607-719-092-975; 064-138-810-036-202; 065-186-992-988-265; 069-524-132-610-400; 071-234-216-800-144; 079-725-390-592-069; 084-970-472-358-639; 085-360-548-865-679; 095-096-161-740-778; 096-370-400-671-817; 104-963-683-392-202; 109-202-790-784-741; 113-830-545-572-413; 113-990-898-518-052; 119-628-533-980-603; 120-749-568-596-544; 169-612-087-067-722; 181-383-343-326-198; 199-963-221-016-954,1,true,cc-by,gold

Looking forward to the fifth industrial revolution it is likely that there will be a paradigm change in how industry will evolve given the tools of industry 4.0; the internet of things, digitization, blockchain, advanced materials, additive manufacture, artificial intelligence and robotics, drones, energy technology, biotechnology, neurotechnology and virtual and augmented reality.",,,432,441,Automation; Manufacturing engineering; Engineering; Neurotechnology; Augmented reality; Manufacturing; Industry 4.0; Digitization; Paradigm shift; Industrial Revolution,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-31343-2_38,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-31343-2_38,,10.1007/978-3-030-31343-2_38,2981675328,,0,008-678-766-846-721; 022-852-661-752-479; 043-730-030-865-991; 063-983-256-176-321; 112-238-474-841-735; 114-749-512-846-746; 142-792-735-104-044,21,false,,

Aditia; R.P. Bastari; L. Agung,"Osamu Tezuka is known as a pioneer of modern manga. His works such as Tetsuwan Atom, Black Jack, and Kimba The White Lion have been translated into various languages and have received many prestigious awards in the field of comics. In 1989, Tezuka passed away, leaving a cultural legacy not only for manga but also for the comics world. Phaidon is a manga created under the name of Tezuka and published in 2020. The interesting thing about Paidon is that its creation was done by Artificial Intelligence and staff from Tezuka Pro. This process is relatively new in comics because, generally, comics are made by an artist/group. This research focuses on Paidon as a case study to build a model of how visual idioms are constructed. The method used is the visual analysis by Gillian Rose, which covers aspects of production, image, and audience, where each aspect includes technological, compositional, and social modalities. This study concludes that the preservation of deceased artists required capable human resources to mimic the visual language; the AI took the role of a production apparatus. This might be one production method in the future. However, without the capabilities of human resources, Paidon would not achieve a maximum visual approach.",,,225,229,Comics; Art; Visual arts; White (mutation); Art history; Literature,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9781003263135-45,,10.1201/9781003263135-45,,,0,,0,false,,

Quantum science completed more than 100 years of existence with pioneers research made by Max Planck to explain black body radiation. This theory, historically speaking, is new by comparison with classical physics. However, quantum physics is revolutionary. It adds novel scientific concepts about our universe and the atomic world, breaking some existing concepts of Isaacs Newton’s Laws in classic physics and Pierre Laplace’s calculus. Contribution for the quantum mechanics provided by notorious scientists such as Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein paved the way for quantum computation and quantum communications. Nowadays, quantum mechanics are being engineered to quantum technologies to start a new scientific revolution and perhaps move our society for Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0. It is known that by 2030 the Big Data will be even more prominent with the number of devices connected to the Internet. Therefore, it is vital to engineering a 6G Radio that is cognitive, fast to predict events, and prevent incidents. For this, 6G Radio must have Artificial Intelligence operating with machine learning with the combined quantum computer superpower to process and harness the incommensurable amount of big data in favor of excellent service level agreements (SLAs) and Quality of Experience (QoE).

A resilient manufacturing strategy based on the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks plays an essential role in facilitating production and supply chain recovery. IIoT contains confidential data and private information, and many security issues arise through vulnerabilities in the infrastructure. The traditional centralized IIoT framework is not only of high cost for system configuration but also vulnerable to cyber-attacks and single-point failure, which is not suitable for achieving the resilient manufacturing vision in Industry 5.0. Recently, researchers are seeking a secure solution of middleware based on blockchain technology integration for decentralized IIoT, which can effectively protect the consistency, integrity, and availability of IIoT data by utilizing the auditing and tamper-proof features of the blockchain. This paper presented a review of secure blockchain middleware for decentralized IIoT towards Industry 5.0. Firstly, the security issues of conventional IIoT solutions and the advantages of blockchain middleware are analyzed. Secondly, an architecture of secure blockchain middleware for decentralized IIoT is proposed. Finally, enabling technologies, challenges, and future directions are reviewed. The innovation of this paper is to study and discuss the distributed blockchain middleware, investigating its ability to eliminate the risk of a single point of failure via a distributed feature in the context of resilient manufacturing in Industry 5.0 and to solve the security issues from traditional centralized IIoT. Also, the four-layer architecture of blockchain middleware presented based on the IIoT application framework is a novel aspect of this review. It is expected that the paper lays a solid foundation for making IIoT blockchain middleware a new venue for Industry 5.0 research.</jats:p>",10,10,858,,,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Fund of Guangdong Province; Natural Science Fund of Guangdong Province; Natural Science Fund of Guangdong Province,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/machines10100858,,10.3390/machines10100858,,,0,000-261-027-537-103; 000-872-274-775-136; 001-025-672-211-909; 001-561-372-119-667; 002-114-422-056-521; 002-906-031-014-709; 003-169-385-977-587; 003-216-340-688-115; 007-553-069-846-19X; 007-943-326-313-110; 008-737-890-599-569; 009-068-005-552-129; 009-232-132-724-44X; 010-339-265-603-049; 013-281-428-291-079; 013-325-592-750-03X; 013-768-322-718-382; 014-448-058-704-128; 014-566-355-592-06X; 014-576-766-124-702; 014-825-574-378-884; 015-218-998-128-071; 016-007-049-512-326; 016-100-817-828-259; 017-394-293-618-324; 019-768-331-540-502; 020-013-299-917-583; 020-530-487-263-965; 021-386-049-291-029; 021-418-156-065-231; 023-133-537-535-501; 024-550-020-211-33X; 024-934-625-349-73X; 025-753-733-708-676; 026-153-304-940-749; 026-534-171-939-646; 028-123-009-840-038; 029-171-255-183-638; 029-381-953-625-267; 029-714-672-913-302; 030-905-864-113-905; 032-500-844-217-691; 034-797-930-862-008; 035-234-337-632-014; 035-234-684-101-98X; 036-132-852-559-789; 036-510-341-898-901; 036-601-600-371-463; 038-895-789-054-515; 040-843-493-429-83X; 040-897-456-290-027; 041-097-380-557-768; 048-758-220-269-775; 052-142-088-397-065; 053-861-123-946-275; 055-342-161-049-071; 057-689-909-095-090; 059-333-593-152-401; 060-317-465-188-456; 060-345-256-979-997; 061-203-150-269-869; 062-614-115-931-397; 064-661-893-399-960; 066-143-370-967-909; 067-459-677-354-645; 067-738-623-411-466; 068-386-989-777-307; 068-907-907-069-034; 070-209-091-447-891; 072-419-424-049-655; 072-587-016-279-817; 073-413-378-211-234; 078-060-382-076-312; 079-962-282-480-456; 087-493-680-373-657; 088-281-655-337-496; 092-564-408-629-605; 096-615-822-223-953; 101-696-242-768-320; 101-996-505-439-153; 103-535-795-864-289; 104-206-873-828-080; 105-055-826-711-737; 105-554-702-157-021; 110-446-885-974-317; 114-116-684-871-032; 115-621-396-169-875; 117-387-081-015-644; 120-111-733-175-565; 121-069-410-268-88X; 121-223-565-842-498; 121-670-906-167-035; 122-406-590-315-532; 124-893-251-163-486; 129-227-139-583-699; 129-770-753-140-155; 134-356-496-514-896; 144-796-391-638-165; 146-032-697-704-412; 147-085-466-685-811; 147-513-850-078-029; 156-790-086-009-432; 158-550-690-868-786; 159-173-902-176-796; 166-495-781-650-37X; 167-092-631-409-345; 174-334-582-241-824; 174-491-947-859-029; 175-122-775-119-632,0,true,cc-by,gold

The paper presents the issue of the importance of personalized production in the perspective of contemporary customer requirements (including personalization of available products) and technological solutions that fit into the trends of modern industrial revolutions. In particular, the article focuses on the conditions and methods of organizing the work in a modular approach with the use of solutions that are key features of Industry 4.0 and 5.0, so that they effectively carry out production orders formulated as part of individual customer orders, thus implementing mass production. As an example illustrating the issue at hand, the model of production of personalized doors and windows in a production plant belonging to a company from the SME sector was presented.KeywordsPersonalized productionMass customizationMass personalizationIndustry 4.0Industry 5.0",,,1,13,Mass customization; Production (economics); Modular design; Automation; Personalization; Manufacturing engineering; Doors; Meaning (existential); Engineering; Industry 4.0; Key (lock); Industrial production; Computer science; Business,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-09360-9_1,,10.1007/978-3-031-09360-9_1,,,0,000-848-828-558-011; 000-976-651-554-969; 015-526-136-271-426; 017-415-713-662-955; 025-974-274-214-35X; 030-944-072-199-706; 031-105-777-707-028; 033-274-213-180-662; 033-541-372-628-755; 048-092-008-205-493; 049-816-999-056-296; 053-751-516-497-397; 064-138-810-036-202; 065-063-956-505-57X; 070-820-595-385-133; 075-662-363-625-645; 083-125-061-921-138; 096-017-941-794-37X; 098-057-334-025-658; 137-341-988-943-248; 151-010-629-726-891,0,false,,

Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menganalis kebijakan pemerintah tentang pengembangan guru di era society 5.0 dengan mengunakan sumber data atau referensi yang berupa buku, jurnal, prosiding dan lain-lain yang secara umum disebut library research. Terdapat beberapa kondisi dan penyebab dari rendahnya kualitas profesi guru, antara lain:  1) Belum tercapainya standarisasi kualifikasi akademik guru minimal D4/S1 sebagaimana tercantum dalam Permendiknas Nomor 16 Tahun 2007, 2) Pengembangan kompetensi guru yang seringkali terhambat karena faktor internal dan eksternal, 3) Rekrutmen guru yang tidak efektif,4) Kesejahteraan guru berupa penghasilan yang masih sangat kecil dan tidak sebanding dengan tugas guru sebagai pembentuk watak dan peradaban manusia.Walaupun kebijakan-kebijakan strategis dari pemerintah yang berkaitan dengan keempathal tersebut sudah ada, namun implementasinya masih sangat kurang apalagi jika dihubungkan dengan kebutuhan era society 5.0 yang menuntut profesionalisme guru yang handal dalam menyiapkan generasi unggul masa kini dan masa yang akan datang.; Kata kunci: kebijakan pemerintah, pengembangan guru, era society 5.0; The era of society 5.0 is a continuation of the era of the industrial revolution 4.0 which further emphasizes the side of humanism in solving social problems including education by integrating virtual and reality. This study aims to analyze government policies on teacher development in the era of society 5.0 by using data sources or references in the form of books, journals, proceedings, and others which are generally called library research. There are several conditions and causes for the low quality of the teaching profession, including: 1) The standardization of minimum academic qualifications of D4/S1 teachers has not been achieved as stated in Permendiknas No. 16 of 2007, 2) Teacher competence is often hampered due to internal and external factors, 3) Ineffective teacher recruitment, 4) Teacher welfare in the form of income which is still very small and not comparable to the teacher's duty as a form of human character and civilization. Even though strategic policies from the government relating to these five things already exist, their implementation is still lacking, especially when connected with the needs of the 5.0 era society which demands reliable professionalism in preparing superior generations today and in the future. </jats:p>",2,2,117,136,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.35719/jieman.v2i2.33,,10.35719/jieman.v2i2.33,,,0,,0,true,cc-by-sa,hybrid

This paper provides a novel study focused on the human aspects involved in industrial HRC by exploring the effects of various HRC setting factors. In particular, this paper aims at investigating the impact of industrial HRC on user experience, affective state, and stress, assessed through both subjective measures (i.e., questionnaires) and objective ones (i.e., physiological signals). A collaborative assembly task was implemented with different configurations, in which the robot movement speed, the distance between the operator and the robot workspace, and the control of the task execution time were varied. Forty-two participants were involved in the study and provided feedbacks on interaction quality and their affective state. Participants’ physiological responses (i.e., electrodermal activity and heart rate) were also collected non-invasively to monitor the amount of stress generated by the interaction. Analysis of both subjective and objective responses revealed how the configuration factors considered influence them. Robot movement speed and control of the task execution time resulted to be the most influential factors. The results also showed the need for customization of HRC to improve ergonomics, both psychological and physical, and the well-being of the operator.</jats:p>",106,2,,,,,,,"Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10846-022-01744-8,,10.1007/s10846-022-01744-8,,,0,001-371-430-906-291; 003-895-722-847-457; 004-877-171-081-463; 007-277-985-466-338; 009-766-493-751-167; 009-962-238-587-011; 011-797-116-120-363; 012-603-390-719-879; 016-693-057-650-297; 018-470-980-839-733; 019-322-807-781-410; 031-311-188-755-66X; 043-376-461-731-259; 046-502-883-588-409; 048-196-188-279-348; 048-215-752-069-802; 049-429-316-643-847; 049-783-671-957-498; 052-480-466-586-464; 054-817-235-104-118; 056-487-069-992-810; 060-681-723-321-098; 060-880-139-042-526; 064-600-226-148-683; 066-760-188-202-831; 067-748-140-319-824; 071-788-380-906-199; 073-807-077-611-754; 081-790-694-130-042; 084-688-266-180-711; 094-300-412-136-41X; 094-962-488-513-157; 096-239-462-922-956; 098-150-923-941-220; 101-555-046-927-567; 104-414-457-934-454; 106-470-097-774-176; 108-826-021-393-366; 115-698-393-672-251; 116-783-289-698-518; 119-327-602-496-18X; 129-316-555-610-005; 179-717-452-517-466,0,false,,

The present industrial wave—Industry 4.0—by using its enabling technologies and principles holds great potential to develop sustainable manufacturing paradigms which require balancing out the three fundamental elements —products, processes, and systems. Yet, numerous stakeholders, including industrial policy and decision makers, remain oblivious of such potential and requirements. Thus, this bibliometric study is aimed at presenting an overview of the broad field of research on the convergence of sustainable manufacturing and Industry 4.0 under the umbrella of “Sustainable Manufacturing 4.0”, which has yet to be developed. It includes the dissemination of original findings on pathways and practices of Industry 4.0 applied to the development of sustainable manufacturing, contributing a bibliometric structure of the literature on the aforementioned convergence to reveal how Industry 4.0 could be used to shift the manufacturing sector to a more sustainable-based state. An initial research agenda for this emerging area has accordingly been presented, which may pave the way for having a futuristic view on Sustainable Manufacturing 5.0 in the next industrial wave, i.e., Industry 5.0.</jats:p>",13,24,13956,13956,Manufacturing; Sustainable development; Business; Field (mathematics); Sustainability; Advanced manufacturing; Industrial organization; Manufacturing engineering; Engineering,,,,University of Technology Malaysia,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132413956,,10.3390/su132413956,,,0,000-154-268-929-69X; 004-112-055-239-935; 004-281-239-042-907; 004-317-549-500-629; 004-412-636-978-087; 004-771-471-010-549; 005-129-164-135-956; 005-648-248-699-892; 006-952-833-525-052; 007-592-719-575-515; 009-146-056-724-526; 010-977-783-106-567; 011-383-825-368-599; 011-575-011-664-790; 015-679-631-932-815; 016-819-194-616-838; 024-386-504-876-926; 024-841-938-591-401; 025-131-859-546-629; 025-253-322-092-116; 026-049-078-551-98X; 026-219-615-660-807; 028-368-253-186-571; 031-540-666-653-73X; 034-344-593-328-178; 036-175-603-962-622; 038-196-787-346-28X; 040-270-893-791-832; 041-437-717-635-476; 045-407-274-782-634; 046-239-928-578-285; 047-707-723-812-745; 048-887-796-847-647; 049-872-293-794-955; 051-735-211-995-456; 053-277-395-582-29X; 059-424-427-267-469; 060-697-636-862-597; 065-407-962-300-016; 065-697-272-243-331; 068-843-345-096-320; 070-047-008-873-090; 072-236-779-686-90X; 072-974-520-873-188; 079-725-390-592-069; 082-092-502-486-561; 087-147-779-068-60X; 090-048-373-299-947; 095-096-161-740-778; 097-206-601-127-115; 098-906-417-385-804; 102-424-326-687-39X; 102-443-972-671-847; 102-861-736-374-631; 107-131-568-310-15X; 108-317-963-192-028; 109-120-948-156-499; 118-108-400-383-703; 118-401-703-686-43X; 119-451-551-173-601; 125-760-277-546-861; 125-972-278-293-709; 126-014-294-266-089; 127-021-195-266-886; 132-434-066-780-80X; 136-831-130-559-080; 138-808-668-276-565; 146-118-783-422-427; 152-146-421-913-400; 156-759-342-367-728; 160-750-127-610-231; 171-625-720-713-000,9,true,cc-by,gold
179-384-538-745-707,EDITORIAL AND INDEX,2021-06-18,2021,journal article,Journal on Innovation and Sustainability RISUS,21793565,Pontifical Catholic University of Sao Paulo (PUC-SP),,Arnoldo José de Hoyos Guevara,"<jats:p>This time we start with several papers regarding the new wave of the Digital Era and the ICT Revolution, starting with the general Framework of Global and Remote Communication that represents on the context of an expanding Globalization the way we are opening to a new world with great opportunities, but that also brings some risks like the Moral Challenges of the advanced technologies of the 4th Industrial Revolution, that hopefully may be overcome in the 5th Industrial Revolution with the kind of Society 5.0 that is emerging in Japan. Moreover, advances in the Digital Era may also foster citizenship development as shown in the next paper; but at the same time represent a challenge regarding professional skills needed in particular for startups that are growing rapidly in number and size everywhere; so this is context of the next paper. Next paper is a study on the Quality of Life at work based on Leadership Models that in particular shows the positive impacts of a more Participatory Leadership. Next paper shows, through a survey of 396 companies in Brazil, that only a small number of organizations deal with the process of retaining professionals identified as potential successors that no doubt could be very relevant for the organization. Regarding Human Resources next paper is a study based on a Semantic Analysis about possibilities that are opening already, at the recruitment and selection process, by using Artificial Intelligence. Next paper seeks to find relationships between motivation and engagement and project management by means of a bibliometric analysis. For this purpose, was performed a cluster analysis of 529 articles using VOXviewer indicated that motivation in projects is strongly linked to professional development and growth, with increased interest in sustainability and in the relationship with stakeholders represented by the internal and external community of projects; and regarding Organizational Culture next paper shows, through a survey of 109 Organizations in Brazil, the importance of integrating Cultural Diversity in Organizations that may not only help to improve social conditions but also lead to recruiting better talents and leads to greater customer orientation, greater employee satisfaction and better decision making representing a win-win strategy. Still regarding Organizational Culture, and based on Quinn and Rohrbaugh’s model, next paper focus impacts on Competitive Strategy in the Banking Segment following Quinn and McGrath approach. Next paper is a statistical study regarding Fidelity in the Physical Fitness Business, using Logistic Regression and unidirectional ANOVA, that surprisingly show that frequency of use was the most relevant variable related to customer retention, rather than price and membership length. Today’s economic impacts of COVID-!9 is leading Public Policies in Governments like Brazil to drastically reduce Investments in Science and Technology that may end up decreasing the Human Development Index – HDI, as shown by next paper based on a previous study of the performance indicators in Science, Technology and Innovation CT&amp;I in 14 countries including some like Brazil. Today, 55% of the world's population lives in urban areas, a proportion that is expected to increase to 68% by 2050; as a matter of fact by 2050, two-thirds of all humanity will live in urban areas; and higher changes have actually been in Latin America and the Caribbean with 81.2% of the population already living in urban areas, up from 41.3% in 1950. Hence particularly in these regions sustainable development will become fundamental for the management of cities, so next paper dealing with a small city in southern Brazil may be helping as Best Practice Case. The city was able, through Team Works, to developed a Municipal Goals Plan based on the Sustainable Development Goals - SDG and in less than 4 years (2017-2020) 90% of which were reached through Work Teams driven basically by: The engagement of those responsible for2RISUS – Journal on Innovation and Sustainability, São Paulo, v. 12, n.2, p. 1-3, abr./mai. 2021 - ISSN 2179-3565Administrative Management, The importance of planning, at both strategic and operational levels, and the commitment of the teams in the execution of the actions. Actually, Brazil for some time has being already counting with an Open Sustainable Cities Program that help cities to develop its own strategies accordingly. Next paper is a survey of 48 companies in Brazil that using Crunchbase and Iramuteq technologies found three classes of business blockchain impact on Business models: A distributed value structure, a governance structure and an application structure aimed at encrypted and tokens. Next paper coming from Ukraine shows an approach for modelling a System of Balanced Criteria of Business Process Management (BPM), focused on large data volumes with a basic processes implemented using the cloud computing service — math.semestr, that may be promising in terms of automation of business process management. Last paper comes from Malaysia and deals with a trial on Home Buyers´ Willingness to Pay (WTP), using an on-line survey constructed using the LMA design tool provided in the ‘support.CEs’ package that showed that even a small and diversified sample of 20 respondents dealing with home buyer preferences for sustainable housing and analyzed using the package’s clogit function may give some results even for the measurement of a higher number of variables.</jats:p>",12,2,1,3,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.23925/2179-3565.2021v12i2p1-3,,10.23925/2179-3565.2021v12i2p1-3,,,0,,0,true,cc-by,gold

These technologies improve working conditions and increase productivity and the quality of industry production. However, they can also improve life and society as a whole. A new perspective is oriented towards social well-being and it is called Society 5.0. Industry 4.0 supports the transition to the new society, but other drivers are also needed. To guide the transition, it is necessary to identify the enabling factors that integrate Industry 4.0. A conceptual framework was developed in which these factors were identified through a literature review and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) methodology. Furthermore, the way in which they relate was evaluated with the help of the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) methodology. The proposed framework fills a research gap, which has not yet consolidated a strategy that includes all aspects of Society 5.0. As a result, the main driver, in addition to technology, is international politics.",6,11,115,,Conceptual framework; Process management; Productivity; Industry 4.0; Production (economics); Quality (business); Computer science; Sustainability; Big data; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/6/11/115 https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/6/11/115/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/data6110115,,10.3390/data6110115,3213193771,,0,001-153-564-508-98X; 002-071-806-060-733; 002-087-337-637-531; 002-317-319-444-753; 003-780-080-948-490; 004-384-911-083-910; 005-819-418-408-810; 006-420-218-506-370; 008-546-666-839-140; 008-854-196-856-708; 009-739-939-773-640; 009-925-932-430-898; 010-490-333-591-716; 011-322-961-973-954; 011-433-174-516-14X; 011-922-319-735-712; 012-905-328-214-187; 013-792-516-751-21X; 014-253-688-185-713; 014-945-902-524-083; 015-072-988-310-524; 015-956-367-071-86X; 016-113-600-021-035; 017-714-406-684-732; 018-234-872-234-652; 021-199-347-876-38X; 023-148-700-512-732; 023-950-217-848-103; 024-646-810-718-131; 026-236-796-746-144; 026-789-706-388-591; 027-194-470-119-742; 027-402-623-487-954; 029-824-583-460-943; 030-090-006-127-177; 032-659-678-378-549; 032-786-307-143-021; 033-361-026-855-789; 033-626-148-746-733; 034-269-270-122-370; 034-338-733-740-375; 036-182-918-009-380; 036-622-826-258-036; 036-784-682-767-502; 037-222-210-713-428; 037-601-419-467-037; 037-806-294-134-050; 040-016-826-435-930; 040-260-866-359-447; 040-853-602-922-973; 040-997-425-075-007; 041-240-993-858-28X; 041-340-647-149-542; 041-443-022-105-584; 041-694-109-480-092; 042-344-288-448-667; 042-417-040-062-765; 044-171-509-096-125; 045-741-087-107-346; 047-282-359-222-480; 048-190-590-775-158; 048-857-633-144-245; 049-596-098-032-340; 050-663-702-011-531; 051-488-098-252-531; 053-225-435-393-801; 054-055-675-342-007; 055-682-225-662-213; 055-960-037-369-543; 056-315-854-501-780; 057-840-249-656-815; 062-769-551-583-014; 063-483-909-050-195; 064-217-977-724-782; 066-670-179-313-83X; 069-667-174-544-526; 070-324-737-054-426; 071-032-802-591-968; 072-556-107-404-263; 074-586-621-031-13X; 077-128-451-912-604; 080-544-902-475-134; 081-642-492-620-997; 081-798-833-690-792; 090-473-375-138-749; 092-258-596-395-205; 096-008-607-656-129; 096-699-900-348-171; 096-853-306-718-283; 098-301-517-119-464; 101-206-685-011-023; 101-811-595-792-810; 107-030-917-099-135; 111-623-101-260-414; 111-916-849-103-565; 114-128-667-881-595; 114-431-546-523-46X; 115-632-812-483-585; 116-133-374-665-169; 123-890-869-492-732; 127-414-207-459-552; 127-510-241-977-855; 127-988-986-578-86X; 128-850-452-856-217; 128-922-969-038-217; 135-317-873-756-837; 137-123-225-023-018; 139-428-930-350-022; 139-477-880-661-623; 145-611-230-988-589; 145-647-081-098-64X; 148-411-664-914-82X; 158-065-515-628-065; 160-965-659-934-980; 165-151-777-965-445; 168-172-311-339-516; 173-487-078-491-112; 177-151-062-200-794; 178-726-548-583-204; 183-881-578-907-231,4,true,cc-by,gold

However, changes caused by introduction of modern technologies, and increasing complexity of products and production, directly affect the industrial enterprises and workers. The critics of the Industry 4.0 paradigm emphasized its orientation to new technologies and digitalization in a technocratic way. Therefore, the new industrial paradigm Industry 5.0 appeared very soon and automatically triggered a debate about the role of, and reasons for applying, the new paradigm. Industry 5.0 is complementing the existing Industry 4.0 paradigm with the orientation to the worker who has an important role in the production process, and that role has been emphasized during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this research, there is a brief discussion on main drivers and enablers for introduction of these new paradigms, then a literature-based analysis is carried out to highlight the differences between two paradigms from three important aspects—people, organization, and technology. The conclusion emphasizes the main features and concerns regarding the movement towards Industry 5.0, and the general conclusion is that there is a significant change of the main research aims from sustainability towards human-centricity.

This pushes us towards the hybridization of manufacturing plants promoting a full collaboration between humans and robots. However, there are currently very few workplaces where effective Human–Robot Collaboration takes place. Layout designing plays a key role in assuring safe and efficient Human–Robot Collaboration. The layout design, especially in the context of collaborative robotics, is a complex problem to face, since it is related to safety, ergonomics, and productivity aspects. In the current work, a Knowledge-Based Approach (KBA) is adopted to face the complexity of the layout design problem. The framework resulting from the KBA allows for developing a modeling paradigm that enables us to define a streamlined approach for the layout design. The proposed approach allows for placing resource within the workplace according to a defined optimization criterion, and also ensures compliance with various standards. This approach is applied to an industrial case study in order to prove its feasibility. A what-if analysis is performed by applying the proposed approach. Changing three control factors (i.e., minimum distance, robot speed, logistic space configuration) on three levels, in a Design of Experiments, 27 layout configurations of the same workplace are generated. Consequently, the inputs that most affect the layout design are identified by means of an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The results show that only one layout is eligible to be the best configuration, and only two out of three control factors are very significant for the designing of the HRC workplace layout. Hence, the proposed approach enables the designing of standard compliant and optimized HRC workplace layouts. Therefore, several alternatives of the layout for the same workplace can be easily generated and investigated in a systematic manner.</jats:p>",11,24,12147,12147,Robot; Page layout; Context (archaeology); Computer science; Human–robot interaction; Industrial engineering; Human–computer interaction; Engineering; Artificial intelligence; Manufacturing engineering,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app112412147,,10.3390/app112412147,,,0,006-393-134-147-357; 012-603-390-719-879; 014-423-283-713-265; 016-693-057-650-297; 017-415-713-662-955; 019-026-189-807-460; 024-991-963-648-020; 026-088-223-648-182; 026-196-739-064-493; 026-354-264-284-345; 036-833-757-046-610; 041-537-459-230-131; 042-882-010-184-116; 042-944-923-273-878; 047-733-204-885-810; 050-948-726-982-075; 052-460-089-716-80X; 053-281-081-843-997; 056-549-990-082-578; 064-734-202-867-898; 067-620-731-341-596; 074-655-004-300-177; 075-221-346-173-364; 085-270-948-232-150; 086-100-048-928-245; 092-260-960-444-046; 093-259-014-765-407; 095-598-472-748-240; 099-125-780-663-236; 100-542-614-991-622; 100-891-688-805-138; 100-992-784-850-783; 103-213-387-161-347; 103-291-441-215-806; 104-736-659-943-73X; 105-355-912-098-881; 107-514-494-874-646; 116-781-863-765-035; 117-392-145-119-140; 118-117-584-262-256; 121-915-962-673-322; 122-209-874-729-144; 124-137-998-295-58X; 126-244-896-522-135; 141-545-186-048-953; 144-302-827-359-931; 146-522-103-522-868; 164-443-597-457-185; 174-683-435-068-334; 177-698-648-541-51X,4,true,cc-by,gold

IIoT devices could help manufacturing companies to observe various production statuses hence improving production efficiency. However, its limitation on resources and features makes robust security implementation a big challenge. Implementing a secure, general and scalable system to adopt across industries is one of the most critical topics for IIoT. This paper proposed a blockchain-based system architecture to auto-update, monitor, and fix the IIoT devices' software. We take the software status snapshots and store them as a blockchain ledger to protect the software's integrity and the software from unauthorized modification. To achieve auto-update and auto fix, we also simulate the concept of a blockchain contract to create the ledger whenever there are changes. As a result, the changes could continuously be tracked. The performance and scalability are also evaluated. The result shows that the system could also be deployed in larger-scale IIoT devices. The software update and fix could be guaranteed authenticated, and the unauthorized software could be monitored and detected.",,,,,Blockchain; Scalability; Computer science; Software; Computer security; Software system; Software engineering; Embedded system,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iemcon53756.2021.9623179,,10.1109/iemcon53756.2021.9623179,,,0,,0,false,,

Based on the available sample of precedents, a statistically reliable decision rule has been developed, on the basis of which a method for recognizing the severity of the condition of new patients can be developed. As an assessment of the severity of the newborn, the probability of its assignment to the corresponding group of patients was used.

The safety and reliability of deep learning-driven systems are still a question under research. The safety of an autonomous guided vehicle is dependent on the proper selection of sensors and the transmission of reflex data. Several academics worked on sensor-based difficulties by developing a sensor correction system and fine-tuning algorithms to regulate the system’s efficiency and precision. In this paper, the introduction of vision sensor and its scene terrain classification using a deep learning algorithm is performed with proposed datasets during sensor failure conditions. The proposed classification technique is to identify the mobile robot obstacle and obstacle-free path for smart logistic vehicle application. To analyze the information from the acquired image datasets, the proposed classification algorithm employs segmentation techniques. The analysis of proposed dataset is validated with U-shaped convolutional network (U-Net) architecture and region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) architecture model. Based on the results, the selection of 1400 raw image datasets is trained and validated using semantic segmentation classifier models. For various terrain dataset clusters, the Mask R-CNN classifier model method has the highest model accuracy of 93%, that is, 23% higher than the U-Net classifier model algorithm, which has the lowest model accuracy nearly 70%. As a result, the suggested Mask R-CNN technique has a significant potential of being used in autonomous vehicle applications. </jats:p>",44,13,2574,2587,Computer science; Convolutional neural network; Artificial intelligence; Segmentation; Classifier (UML); Deep learning; Terrain; Motion planning; Computer vision; Obstacle; Pattern recognition (psychology); Machine learning,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01423312211062972,,10.1177/01423312211062972,,,0,017-375-771-198-51X; 021-360-232-245-594; 029-455-317-577-240; 037-209-759-987-50X; 037-732-454-119-863; 040-907-625-643-732; 043-712-251-986-27X; 050-196-614-928-315; 052-671-505-218-595; 059-108-746-014-683; 059-706-283-252-318; 067-864-177-074-523; 075-431-590-797-916; 075-520-176-783-847; 093-897-163-742-694; 109-137-747-859-244; 123-701-088-574-502; 133-601-758-534-88X; 151-396-031-576-889,1,false,,

DTs can bring benefits e.g., increase visibility, safety, and accessibility of the system. Further, digital experimentation can reduce time and cost. Though, application of DT technologies involves challenges i.e., model accuracy or errors in transferring data or codes between the DT and the physical twin. Many studies on DTs focus on industrial applications. However, DT technology has potential for implementation of digital labs in education. This aspect of DTs is of rising importance as distance education has increased over the last decade and access to physical laboratories can be restricted due to factors such as the Covid-19 pandemic. Thus, there is a need to study the use of DT technology in higher education. To address this, we investigate possibilities and challenges of applying DT technology in education to conduct industrial-like labs virtually. A case of an automation line, with full scale industrial equipment, based at a research center, is focused. Results emphasize that the application of DT technologies require multi-domain expertise to understand the consequences of every single decision in the design process on every piece of equipment involved, making the modelling process complex and time consuming. Thus, when applied in education, test procedures need to be designed to focus on students’ motivation, improved learning and understanding of production systems. DTs are considered enabling technologies supporting the concept of Industry 5.0, thus stressing the human-centric aspects of advancing Industry 4.0. The predicted application of DTs emphasizes the need for educational curricula that include laboratory applications and theoretic understanding of DT technologies. This study focusses the application of DT technologies in higher education curricula, but the result of the study can contribute to other areas such as automation and virtual commissioning towards smarter manufacturing.</jats:p>",,,,,Automation; Process (computing); Domain (mathematical analysis); Industry 4.0; Engineering; Computer science; Engineering management,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/atde220165,,10.3233/atde220165,,,0,,0,true,,gold

192-397-051-503-54X,Sustainable Human–Machine Collaborations in Digital Transformation Technologies Adoption: A Comparative Case Study of Japan and Germany,2022-08-25,2022,journal article,Sustainability,20711050,MDPI AG,Switzerland,Young Won Park; Junjiro Shintaku,"<jats:p>The Digital Transformation (DX) megatrend is fundamentally disrupting and changing the nature of work, business, and industry at a rapid pace. Although the notion of DX has garnered much research interest from practitioners, scholarship on this topic is somehow lagging behind, possibly because of the lack of theoretical frameworks on DX. Recently, most Japanese firms have begun to use diverse digital technologies to sustain their competitive advantages. However, the return of investment on digital technologies has not been as high as expected for some firms. Furthermore, as the visions of Industry 5.0 describe sustainable, resilient, and human-centered future factories that will require smart and resilient capabilities both from next-generation manufacturing systems and human operators, it is necessary to design resilient human–machine collaborations within factories. To this end, this paper presents a research model between DX technologies and scientific problem-solving in terms of deduction, induction, and abduction inference structures as an approach to resilient human–machine collaborations. The purpose of this research is to analyze the difference in the utilization pattern of the digital technology of American, German, and Japanese firms based on three types of decision-making methods. Next, we apply this framework in a comparative case study of two Japanese firms and one German firm, where we find that there is a difference in DX technologies utilization among the Japanese and German firms. We assert that the utilization of IoT technology in the United States and Germany is pursuing IoT with the aim of autonomous control, whereas Japanese firms prioritize robot–human collaboration. Finally, we discuss how our findings contribute to the burgeoning field of resilient human–machine collaborations by showing the distinct roles of deduction, induction, and abduction inference structures. Furthermore, our research contributes to international comparative studies to identify the difference in national IT utilization. Lessons and implications are discussed.</jats:p>",14,17,10583,10583,Lagging; Digital transformation; German; Pace; Industrial organization; Vision; Industry 4.0; Business; Computer science; Marketing,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su141710583,,10.3390/su141710583,,,0,002-085-045-445-344; 003-399-150-768-506; 006-947-132-272-228; 007-157-342-877-831; 009-851-433-625-819; 012-218-887-216-344; 022-613-542-030-336; 023-790-190-496-186; 025-838-880-494-316; 031-235-778-832-782; 036-555-670-584-005; 041-406-317-756-787; 053-089-404-364-449; 056-485-524-375-867; 061-012-983-689-452; 063-390-375-334-464; 067-050-661-116-219; 068-833-488-459-388; 081-596-379-437-686; 087-501-199-643-670; 088-321-242-569-049; 102-113-825-126-978; 102-226-089-425-46X; 115-232-897-230-33X; 143-724-850-069-880; 146-473-356-444-943; 148-879-759-455-156; 157-213-706-957-756; 171-092-306-725-218,0,true,cc-by,gold

The proposal of Industry 5.0 begins to take the coordinated development between human and various production factors as one of the key points of corporate sustainable management. Therefore, this paper studies the optimization of medical enterprise’s operations management considering enterprise CSR under Industry 5.0. A mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is developed to maximize the CSR with the consideration of the impact of precision medical technologies such as surgical robots (SRs) and 3D bone printing on employee social welfare, corporate profits, social environment, and customer surplus value. An improved variable neighborhood tabu search (IVNTS) algorithm which combines the variable neighborhood tabu search (VNTS) algorithm and simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is designed to solve the model, and numerical experiments are analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed IVNTS.

In extreme climates when the received signals are severely attenuated, the accuracy of classification of this technology is known to decrease remarkably; while neural nets have enhanced performance, they only function properly when trained with large numbers of evaluated based. Therefore, in extreme climates, where adequate samples are hard to procure, reasonable sensor exactness is still unspecified. We look at the possible application of anomaly detection methods based on machine learning. This study examines the performance of a top-down, phenomenology model generated using a neural net and large global average monthly temperature data. The neural network algorithm accurately forecasts an increase and drop in temperature throughout the next ten years by generating explicit depictions using the month-to-month temperature records of 30 years. In this paper, we constructed a deep classification system for the convolutional neural network and showed how beneficial deep learning is to address the problems of climate patterns.",,,385,394,Convolutional neural network; Artificial neural network; Deep learning; Computer science; Climate change; Anomaly detection; Internet of Things; Software deployment; Wireless sensor network; Artificial intelligence; Comprehension; Machine learning,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-2980-9_30,,10.1007/978-981-19-2980-9_30,,,0,015-882-946-838-00X; 026-188-681-611-940; 029-968-307-002-121; 030-252-624-379-880; 038-887-728-114-115; 039-092-946-980-115; 040-601-075-773-986; 047-431-928-315-959; 054-829-927-681-213; 058-400-879-756-332; 058-472-246-478-312; 060-515-391-672-33X; 065-771-493-998-028; 069-733-224-070-73X; 070-774-928-465-111; 074-597-483-279-519; 075-543-178-247-871; 087-478-723-127-080; 091-575-430-452-751; 098-972-464-406-597; 102-750-567-617-441; 112-063-913-978-660; 119-397-967-338-890; 130-432-965-964-977; 133-363-537-119-85X; 148-084-140-950-832; 156-995-005-558-376; 168-422-348-213-852,0,false,,
