limitation in fossil fuel supplies. The algae industrial revolutions have proved to be a significant step to realize the growing need for energy and achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs). In this review, the production and processing of algae from an industry point of view and the algae processing in Industry 4.0 as well as a paradigmatic shift from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 were well-delineated. Moreover, numerous aspects in the algae industry have been discussed, including economic and environmental analysis of algae bioenergy production, customization of the algae-derived bioenergy, algae cultivation and modifications in the cultivating approach. Genetic engineering tools implemented in the algae culture for bioenergy and by-products generation was also studied, and area of focusing such as the desired algae strain and its detection through automated genetic manipulation and genetic modification. Furthermore, the impacts of the Industry 5.0 on the new market opportunities and environment aspect as well as the possibility of achieving SDGs were significantly studied.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"MY"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"155043079"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.440435.2"},{"type":"ror","value":"04mz9mt17"}],"name":"University

abroad concept of Industry 4.0. It starts with the historic evolution of industry, separated by date landmarks and approaches the last transition between 3.0 to 4.0.Apart from the differences between industry models, production data stats show a huge and important transformation in the amount of data related to manufacturing and how that knowledge is processed. The paper also aims to put on debate the lack of solutions regarding the knowledge extraction of data from machines and systems, needed for data analytics.Approaches with cyber-physical systems, machine learning, virtual environments, Industrial IoT1 and augmented reality, in an industrial scale, are some of the strategies to power the reading and interpretation of data, in order to promote industrial efficiency.Real context industrial applications are taken into account in order to state the importance of collected data in the efficiency of a production process. Exploring technologies and concepts to improve digital twins systems, perception and perceived systems as well as maintenance processes are some of the explored implemented strategies that make Industry 4.0. Some possible strategies are presented, as well as the transition for Industry 5.0.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"PT"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"60858718"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.7311.4"},{"type":"fundref","value":"100007689"},{"type":"ror","value":"00nt41z93"}],"name":"University of Aveiro"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Miguel","initials":"M","last_name":"Oliveira"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"PT"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"60858718"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.7311.4"},{"type":"fundref","value":"100007689"},{"type":"ror","value":"00nt41z93"}],"name":"University of Aveiro"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Daniel","initials":"D","last_name":"Afonso"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2019-07-19T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"18","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Knowledge extraction"},{"name":"Data collection"},{"name":"Augmented reality"},{"name":"Data analysis"},{"name":"Data science"},{"name":"Industry 4.0"},{"name":"Context (language use)"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Reading (process)"},{"name":"Big data"}],"funding":[],"issue":"2019","keywords":[],"lens_id":"003-942-017-596-890","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"conference proceedings article","references":[{"lens_id":"016-303-567-431-004"},{"lens_id":"018-220-981-976-340"},{"lens_id":"041-437-717-635-476"},{"lens_id":"195-786-986-400-616"}],"scholarly_citations_count":6,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[],"publisher":"ACM","title_full":"Proceedings of the 2019 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Information Technology"},"source_urls":[{"type":"html","url":"https://ria.ua.pt/handle/10773/26502"},{"type":"html","url":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3352411.3352414"},{"type":"html","url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3352411.3352414"},{"type":null,"url":"https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/dsit/dsit2019.html#OliveiraA19"},{"type":"pdf","url":"https://ria.ua.pt/bitstream/10773/26502/1/D004.pdf"},{"type":"pdf","url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3352411.3352414"},{"type":"core_fulltext","url":"https://core.ac.uk/download/231954004.pdf"}],"start_page":"12","title":"DSIT - Industry Focused in Data Collection: How Industry 4.0 is Handled by Big Data","volume":null,"year_published":2019},{"abstract":"We are still in the midst of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), with more manufacturing lines being labeled as smart thanks to the integration of advanced ICT in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). While I4.0 aims to provision cognitive CPS systems, the nascent Industry 5.0 (I5.0) era goes a step beyond, aiming to build cross-border, sustainable, and circular value chains benefiting society as a whole. An enabler of this vision is the integration of data and AI in the industrial decision-making process, which does not exhibit yet a coordination between the Operation and Information Technology domains (OT/IT). This work proposes an architectural approach and an accompanying software prototype addressing the OT/IT convergence problem. The approach is based on a two-layered middleware solution, where each layer aims to better serve the specific differentiated requirements of the OT and IT layers. The proposal is validated in a real testbed, employing actual machine data, showing the capacity of the components to gracefully scale and serve increasing data volumes.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering (DISI), University of Bologna, Viale Risorgimento 2, 40136 Bologna, Italy."}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Lorenzo","initials":"L","last_name":"Patera"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering (DISI), University of Bologna, Viale Risorgimento 2, 40136 Bologna, Italy."}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Andrea","initials":"A","last_name":"Garbugli"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering (DISI), University of Bologna, Viale Risorgimento 2, 40136 Bologna, Italy."}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Armir","initials":"A","last_name":"Bujari"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering (DISI), University of Bologna, Viale Risorgimento 2, 40136 Bologna, Italy."}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Domenico","initials":"D","last_name":"Scotece"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering (DISI), University of Bologna, Viale Risorgimento 2, 40136 Bologna, Italy."}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Antonio","initials":"A","last_name":"Corradi"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2021-12-28T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":null,"fields_of_study":[{"name":"Enabling"},{"name":"Testbed"},{"name":"Middleware (distributed applications)"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Process (computing)"},{"name":"Cyber-physical system"},{"name":"Industry 4.0"},{"name":"Convergence (economics)"},{"name":"Software"},{"name":"Information and Communications Technology"},{"name":"System integration"},{"name":"Software engineering"}],"funding":[],"issue":"1","keywords":[{"value":"Industry 5.0"},{"value":"OT/IT integration"},{"value":"cloud continuum"},{"value":"cyber–physical systems"},{"value":"machine-to-machine"},{"value":"smart manufacturing"}],"lens_id":"004-345-655-576-30X","mesh_terms":[{"mesh_heading":"Industry","mesh_id":"D007221","qualifier_id":null,"qualifier_name":null},{"mesh_heading":"Information Technology","mesh_id":"D000073256","qualifier_id":null,"qualifier_name":null},{"mesh_heading":"Software","mesh_id":"D012984","qualifier_id":null,"qualifier_name":null}],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"013-024-374-365-732"},{"lens_id":"023-178-507-463-18X"},{"lens_id":"046-168-936-322-452"},{"lens_id":"050-997-950-548-215"},{"lens_id":"051-794-592-567-825"},{"lens_id":"054-337-564-111-551"},{"lens_id":"060-317-465-188-456"},{"lens_id":"098-064-383-401-264"},{"lens_id":"101-811-273-263-30X"},{"lens_id":"123-003-416-766-610"},{"lens_id":"123-760-662-586-373"}],"scholarly_citations_count":6,"source":{"country":"Switzerland","issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"14248220"},{"type":"print","value":"14243210"}],"publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","title_full":"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"190","title":"A Layered Middleware for OT/IT Convergence to Empower Industry 5.0 Applications.","volume":"22","year_published":2021},{"abstract":"The industrial revolution has changed the socio-economic civilisation of mankind. It started dating back in the late 1700s and has been in continuous evolution since then. Presently, we are experiencing the latest industrial revolution, known as Industry 4.0. Among others, ubiquitous technologies probably have been the most influential in the implementation of Industry 4.0. This has led to a new manufacturing paradigm known as ubiquitous manufacturing. This chapter presents an in-depth discussion on different aspects of ubiquitous manufacturing. In addition to the history of industrial revolutions and the fundamentals of ubiquitous manufacturing, the topics such as production planning and scheduling, automated material handling system, and dynamic manufacturing are meticulously discussed from the perspective of the real-life scenarios, in the age of ubiquitous manufacturing. The ubiquitous technologies that have enabled ubiquitous manufacturing are reviewed in detail. Several other related and advanced manufacturing technologies such as cloud manufacturing, cloud robotics, global manufacturing, lean manufacturing, agile manufacturing, additive manufacturing, chaordic manufacturing, etc. are duly accentuated. A futuristic view on Industry 5.0 is also presented.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"IN"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"155837530"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.444419.8"},{"type":"ror","value":"04ds0jm32"}],"name":"National

The introduction of green behavior through ecoliteracy is very important for children through the role of adults. Children must have an awareness of loving the environment so that when the child has the awareness to love the environment, the child will happily show behavior to protect the universe. Study Methods This is a literature review of various sources related to ecoliteracy that are relevant to embedding green behavior in early childhood. There are several interesting ways to introduce green behavior through ecoliteracy in early childhood which are obtained from the results of the study of relevant studies, among others, by using storytelling methods, conducting field trips or field trips, and carrying out project activities to preserve the surrounding environment.","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Eka","initials":"E","last_name":"Setiawati"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":null,"initials":null,"last_name":"Usmaedi"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Ayi Teiri","initials":"AT","last_name":"Nurtiani"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":null,"initials":null,"last_name":"Nuryati"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Agustinus Tandilo","initials":"AT","last_name":"Mamma"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":null,"initials":null,"last_name":"Sirjon"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":null,"initials":null,"last_name":"Yusdiana"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Suci Aprilyati","initials":"SA","last_name":"Ruiyat"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Ayu","initials":"A","last_name":"Fajarwati"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Anggi","initials":"A","last_name":"Rahmani"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Dedi","initials":"D","last_name":"Aryadi"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":null,"initials":null,"last_name":"Hartuti"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Yuni Nuraeni","initials":"YN","last_name":"Setiana"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":null},"end_page":"1558","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Sociology"},{"name":"TRIPS architecture"},{"name":"Storytelling"},{"name":"Early childhood"},{"name":"Study methods"},{"name":"Environmental ethics"}],"funding":[],"issue":"11","keywords":[],"lens_id":"004-830-845-391-516","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"unknown","value":"09758453"}],"publisher":null,"title_full":"Systematic Reviews in Pharmacy"},"source_urls":[{"type":"pdf","url":"https://www.sysrevpharm.org/articles/develop-green-behaviour-through-ecoliteracy-for-early-children.pdf"},{"type":"html","url":"https://www.sysrevpharm.org/abstract/develop-green-behaviour-through-ecoliteracy-for-early-children-66802.html"}],"start_page":"1551","title":"Develop Green Behaviour through Ecoliteracy for Early Children","volume":"11","year_published":2020},{"abstract":"Female genital mutilation (FGM) or female circumcision is a traditional practice among various tribes in Africa including Nigeria. Under this paper I have highlighted the pros and cons in favour and those oppose to the practice. The practitioners argued for its continuation because it was an important cultural heritage that marks the transition of a girl from childhood to adulthood while the abolitionists wanted it to be abolished because it violates human rights. I have adopted a doctrinal method of research under this paper to look into the veracity of the arguments of both sides. The prevailing opinion is that FGM or female circumcision violated both constitutionally guaranteed rights like rights to life, health, physical integrity, dignity, etc and human rights treaties and Conventions like United Nations Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Covenant on Civil and Political rights, the Maputo Protocol, etc. in view of this the practice should be abolished.      Keywords: Female, Genital, Mutilation, Circumcision, Cutting, Women’s Right.

Rather than replacing humans, Industry 5.0 explores how humans and robots can best complement one another's unique strengths. However, realizing this vision requires an in-depth understanding of how workers view the positive and negative attributes of their jobs, and the place of robots within it. In this paper, we explore the relationship between work attributes and automation goals by engaging in field research at a manufacturing plant. We conducted 50 face-to-face interviews with assembly-line workers $(\\mathrm{n}=50)$ , which we analyzed using discourse analysis and social constructivist methods. We found that the work attributes deemed most positive by participants include social interaction, movement and exercise, (human) autonomy, problem solving, task variety, and building with their hands. The main negative work attributes included health and safety issues, feeling rushed, and repetitive work. We identified several ways robots could help reduce negative work attributes and enhance positive ones, such as reducing work interruptions and cultivating physical and psychological well-being. Based on our findings, we created a set of integration considerations for organizations planning to deploy robotics technology, and discuss how the manufacturing and HRI communities can explore these ideas in the future.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"US"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"188538660"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.266190.a"},{"type":"fundref","value":"100007493"},{"type":"ror","value":"02ttsq026"}],"name":"University of Colorado Boulder"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Katherine S.","initials":"KS","last_name":"Welfare"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"US"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"188538660"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.266190.a"},{"type":"fundref","value":"100007493"},{"type":"ror","value":"02ttsq026"}],"name":"University of Colorado Boulder"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Matthew R.","initials":"MR","last_name":"Hallowell"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"US"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"63966007"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.116068.8"},{"type":"fundref","value":"100006919"},{"type":"wikidata","value":"q49108"},{"type":"ror","value":"042nb2s44"}],"name":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Julie A.","initials":"JA","last_name":"Shah"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"US"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"36258959"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.266100.3"},{"type":"fundref","value":"100007911"},{"type":"ror","value":"0168r3w48"}],"name":"University of California, San Diego"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Laurel D.","initials":"LD","last_name":"Riek"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":null},"end_page":"84","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Field research"},{"name":"Variety (cybernetics)"},{"name":"Psychology"},{"name":"Task analysis"},{"name":"Work (electrical)"},{"name":"Workforce"},{"name":"Work experience"},{"name":"Knowledge management"},{"name":"Autonomy"},{"name":"Discourse analysis"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"006-082-033-375-192","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"conference proceedings article","references":[{"lens_id":"001-121-290-926-132"},{"lens_id":"002-584-751-652-291"},{"lens_id":"003-793-700-759-176"},{"lens_id":"004-354-297-930-966"},{"lens_id":"004-771-471-010-549"},{"lens_id":"012-370-295-968-16X"},{"lens_id":"012-710-005-889-438"},{"lens_id":"013-420-504-189-875"},{"lens_id":"014-398-665-908-576"},{"lens_id":"016-782-552-400-986"},{"lens_id":"017-089-665-436-038"},{"lens_id":"018-601-301-453-597"},{"lens_id":"022-425-262-957-817"},{"lens_id":"024-649-196-865-724"},{"lens_id":"029-101-543-228-171"},{"lens_id":"032-254-293-408-115"},{"lens_id":"036-704-073-047-822"},{"lens_id":"041-526-359-881-654"},{"lens_id":"042-211-564-277-43X"},{"lens_id":"042-534-131-021-574"},{"lens_id":"042-588-618-550-033"},{"lens_id":"046-013-428-757-779"},{"lens_id":"046-875-312-520-293"},{"lens_id":"048-522-436-982-27X"},{"lens_id":"055-472-948-144-561"},{"lens_id":"056-728-662-820-803"},{"lens_id":"059-474-784-814-112"},{"lens_id":"065-623-633-767-666"},{"lens_id":"067-038-345-648-879"},{"lens_id":"068-013-611-636-252"},{"lens_id":"070-801-412-682-60X"},{"lens_id":"071-095-229-290-158"},{"lens_id":"073-128-134-887-817"},{"lens_id":"079-223-098-124-911"},{"lens_id":"084-969-912-500-793"},{"lens_id":"086-419-127-879-925"},{"lens_id":"088-721-426-301-445"},{"lens_id":"090-334-590-886-301"},{"lens_id":"091-725-872-061-572"},{"lens_id":"091-954-013-787-526"},{"lens_id":"095-811-393-275-086"},{"lens_id":"098-346-104-521-26X"},{"lens_id":"098-620-854-119-009"},{"lens_id":"101-113-684-704-95X"},{"lens_id":"103-597-914-038-179"},{"lens_id":"104-096-765-444-763"},{"lens_id":"111-141-823-258-031"},{"lens_id":"115-210-856-810-410"},{"lens_id":"120-441-241-892-092"},{"lens_id":"124-114-062-999-318"},{"lens_id":"134-932-989-205-250"},{"lens_id":"137-441-705-929-277"},{"lens_id":"138-223-939-384-207"},{"lens_id":"140-006-634-478-430"},{"lens_id":"142-048-600-326-867"},{"lens_id":"150-246-476-000-161"},{"lens_id":"161-172-850-367-669"},{"lens_id":"168-959-595-262-053"},{"lens_id":"171-596-748-965-859"},{"lens_id":"178-184-306-028-968"},{"lens_id":"178-912-373-262-853"},{"lens_id":"179-120-475-949-307"},{"lens_id":"193-364-789-473-151"},{"lens_id":"198-305-974-153-055"}],"scholarly_citations_count":26,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[],"publisher":"IEEE","title_full":"2019 14th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)"},"source_urls":[{"type":"html","url":"https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/hri/hri2019.html#WelfareHSR19"},{"type":"html","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8673139/"}],"start_page":"75","title":"HRI -

The opportunities can contribute to the sustainable performance of the supply chains and their territories. The Industry 4.0 can also generate challenges like the social inequalities related to the position of the man in the labor market by replacing the human workforce with the machines. Therefore, the man-machine relationship in the Industry 4.0 era is analyzed as a gap in the literature. Therefore, as a way to fill this gap, the authors of this article suggest the exploration of the research focused on the Society 5.0. Also known as “super-smart society,” this recent theme appeared in Japan in April 2016. According to Fukuda (2020), in addition to the focus on the technological development, the Society 5.0 also aims at the quality of life and the social challenge resolutions.,This article contributes to the analysis of the Industry 4.0 technologies as facilitators in the sustainable supply chain performance. It addresses the impacts of the Industry 4.0 technologies applied to the supply chains in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it analyzes the research gaps and limitations found in the literature. The result of this study can add value and stimulate new research studies related to the application of the Industry 4.0 technologies as facilitators in the supply chain sustainable performance. It can encourage the studies related to the COVID-19 impacts on the sustainable supply chains, and it can promote the research development on the relationship among the man, the machine and the labor in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Carina","initials":"C","last_name":"Acioli"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Annibal

(HRM) systems is a sine qua non for any organization for successfully adopting and implementing Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). However, these systems are required to ensure non-biased, efficient, transparent and secure environment. Blockchain, a technology based on distributed digital ledgers, can help facilitate the process of successfully effectuating these specifications. A detailed literature review has been conducted to identify the current status of usage of Information Technology in the domain of Human Resource Management and how Blockchain can help achieve a smart, cost-effective, efficient, transparent and secure factory management system. A Blockchain based Recruitment Management System (BcRMS) as well as Blockchain based Human Resource Management System (BcHRMS) algorithm have been proposed. From the analysis of the results obtained through the case study, it is evident that the proposed system holds definite advantages compared to the existing recruitment systems. Future research directions have also been identified and advocated.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"KR"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"104338594"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.411612.1"},{"type":"ror","value":"04xqwq985"}],"name":"Inje University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Mehedi Hassan","initials":"MH","last_name":"Onik"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"BH"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"300940544"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.448808.8"},{"type":"ror","value":"00h15ta02"}],"name":"AMA International University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"H.","initials":"H","last_name":"Miraz"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"KR"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"104338594"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.411612.1"},{"type":"ror","value":"04xqwq985"}],"name":"Inje University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Chul-Soo","initials":"C","last_name":"Kim"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":null},"end_page":"6","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Engineering management"},{"name":"Information technology"},{"name":"Human resource management system"},{"name":"Management system"},{"name":"Human resource management"},{"name":"Industry 4.0"},{"name":"Blockchain"},{"name":"Factory (object-oriented programming)"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Process (engineering)"},{"name":"Industrial Revolution"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"006-411-480-299-202","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":1,"publication_type":"conference proceedings article","references":[{"lens_id":"007-553-069-846-19X"},{"lens_id":"019-678-031-064-832"},{"lens_id":"027-177-624-795-31X"},{"lens_id":"030-236-109-234-935"},{"lens_id":"040-723-261-173-592"},{"lens_id":"054-614-088-841-213"},{"lens_id":"081-365-052-727-317"},{"lens_id":"086-219-547-937-793"},{"lens_id":"088-632-570-317-877"},{"lens_id":"089-363-390-670-335"},{"lens_id":"111-448-482-795-037"},{"lens_id":"117-219-057-745-062"},{"lens_id":"132-314-003-307-090"},{"lens_id":"136-965-945-109-201"},{"lens_id":"177-107-873-531-089"},{"lens_id":"186-307-980-097-241"}],"scholarly_citations_count":42,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[],"publisher":"Institution of Engineering and Technology","title_full":"Smart Cities Symposium 2018"},"source_urls":[{"type":"html","url":"http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv181203237M/abstract"},{"type":"html","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03237"},{"type":"pdf","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.03237"},{"type":"core_fulltext","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03237"}],"start_page":"1","title":"A Recruitment and Human Resource Management Technique Using Blockchain Technology for Industry 4.0","volume":null,"year_published":2018},{"abstract":"<jats:p>Risk management is one of the topical areas in construction project management research. However, no attempt has been made in the past decades to explore the emerging themes in this area. This paper reviews the research trends in risk management in construction. The bibliometric data of 1635 publications between 1979 and 2022 were extracted from Scopus using a set of keywords. The study used VOSviewer and Gephi to conduct a scientometric analysis on the extracted publications. The review outcome indicates a significant increase in publications on risk management in construction, with about 205 publications recorded between 2021 and 2022 alone. Based on this analysis, it is projected that the next decade will see significant research on risk management, especially as the construction industry moves towards Industry 5.0 with many uncertainties. Further, the most productive countries of risk management studies in construction include China, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Hong Kong. Emerging key research areas are discussed using network diagrams and clusters. These areas include the processes in risk management, risk analytical models and techniques, sources of risk and uncertainties, effective knowledge-based systems for improved risk management, risk contingency in construction contracts, risk-integrated project planning and scheduling, and stakeholder management. The findings of this study inform researchers on the current progress of risk management studies in construction and highlight possible research directions that can be considered.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"AU"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I63525965"},{"type":"ror","value":"03t52dk35"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.1029.a"}],"name":"Western Sydney University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Robert","initials":"R","last_name":"Osei-Kyei"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Timur","initials":"T","last_name":"Narbaev"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Godslove","initials":"G","last_name":"Ampratwum"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-08-31T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"1342","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Risk management"},{"name":"Stakeholder"},{"name":"Project risk management"},{"name":"IT risk management"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Risk analysis (engineering)"},{"name":"Risk management framework"},{"name":"Scopus"},{"name":"Risk assessment"},{"name":"Risk management plan"},{"name":"Engineering"}],"funding":[{"country":null,"funding_id":null,"org":"Science Committee of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan"}],"issue":"9","keywords":[],"lens_id":"006-449-016-985-018","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"001-894-368-767-122"},{"lens_id":"003-912-384-463-283"},{"lens_id":"004-348-751-680-442"},{"lens_id":"005-925-984-223-051"},{"lens_id":"008-346-389-577-405"},{"lens_id":"010-171-819-922-943"},{"lens_id":"013-123-944-981-275"},{"lens_id":"018-067-060-066-520"},{"lens_id":"022-185-892-291-255"},{"lens_id":"022-409-042-563-509"},{"lens_id":"025-889-332-248-667"},{"lens_id":"027-571-651-572-301"},{"lens_id":"027-981-553-410-415"},{"lens_id":"030-772-480-390-843"},{"lens_id":"035-292-136-057-557"},{"lens_id":"042-061-286-379-055"},{"lens_id":"046-727-219-981-488"},{"lens_id":"047-134-478-431-993"},{"lens_id":"047-564-268-551-866"},{"lens_id":"048-274-932-822-419"},{"lens_id":"048-536-146-197-924"},{"lens_id":"050-068-788-406-609"},{"lens_id":"057-062-781-863-898"},{"lens_id":"057-407-520-193-786"},{"lens_id":"063-907-427-205-680"},{"lens_id":"064-622-226-235-864"},{"lens_id":"067-164-171-987-113"},{"lens_id":"067-697-467-605-585"},{"lens_id":"068-963-905-554-251"},{"lens_id":"069-572-718-065-071"},{"lens_id":"075-362-012-742-087"},{"lens_id":"084-521-600-908-380"},{"lens_id":"086-865-887-177-192"},{"lens_id":"089-271-182-897-916"},{"lens_id":"090-809-401-873-322"},{"lens_id":"093-999-172-956-296"},{"lens_id":"094-145-717-742-27X"},{"lens_id":"096-877-648-034-697"},{"lens_id":"098-015-124-763-403"},{"lens_id":"103-117-579-810-903"},{"lens_id":"107-518-655-388-824"},{"lens_id":"113-892-296-467-80X"},{"lens_id":"116-382-252-458-396"},{"lens_id":"117-958-925-859-887"},{"lens_id":"122-499-073-680-182"},{"lens_id":"144-883-798-820-546"},{"lens_id":"162-061-485-260-234"},{"lens_id":"162-123-368-418-70X"},{"lens_id":"165-969-546-748-436"},{"lens_id":"193-408-680-898-115"},{"lens_id":"195-989-268-216-224"},{"lens_id":"197-970-059-894-726"}],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"unknown","value":"20755309"}],"publisher":"MDPI AG","title_full":"Buildings"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"1342","title":"A Scientometric Analysis of Studies on Risk Management in Construction Projects","volume":"12","year_published":2022},{"abstract":"The widespread digitization and dynamic development of the technologies of the fourth industrial revolution, leading to the dehumanization of industry, have increased the interest of the scientific community in aspects of industrial humanization, sustainability and resilience.

A bibliometric analysis of Web of Science using Vosviewer tools, Excell and content analysis of selected papers were applied. The most important results include the determination of the dynamics of the increase in the number of publications in the segment of Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0. The article indicates the weaknesses of the concept of Industry 4.0, especially in the area of the role of man in smart factories and sustainable development. Thus, the framework of the concept of Industry 5.0 was identified. In addition, the bibliometric analysis carried out allowed the identification of an important stream of employee skill development.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Department of Production Engineering, Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland."}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Sandra","initials":"S","last_name":"Grabowska"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Department of Engineering Management and Logistic Systems, University of Zielona Gora, Zielona Gora, Poland."}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Sebastian","initials":"S","last_name":"Saniuk"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Department of Industrial Informatics, Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland."}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Bożena","initials":"B","last_name":"Gajdzik"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-04-27T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"3144","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Digitization"},{"name":"Sustainability"},{"name":"Industry 4.0"},{"name":"Identification (biology)"},{"name":"Sustainable development"},{"name":"Industrial Revolution"},{"name":"Strengths and weaknesses"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Knowledge management"}],"funding":[],"issue":"6","keywords":[{"value":"Human centric"},{"value":"Human factors"},{"value":"Industry 4.0"},{"value":"Industry 5.0"},{"value":"Resilient"},{"value":"Sustainability"}],"lens_id":"006-649-350-429-398","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"002-995-208-654-267"},{"lens_id":"003-304-795-752-398"},{"lens_id":"006-082-033-375-192"},{"lens_id":"017-415-713-662-955"},{"lens_id":"031-788-368-038-551"},{"lens_id":"036-652-321-315-178"},{"lens_id":"043-663-364-756-376"},{"lens_id":"047-344-167-153-151"},{"lens_id":"048-872-880-871-621"},{"lens_id":"049-291-448-765-548"},{"lens_id":"049-816-999-056-296"},{"lens_id":"051-719-689-499-873"},{"lens_id":"054-842-941-091-224"},{"lens_id":"061-508-236-488-840"},{"lens_id":"071-666-089-865-306"},{"lens_id":"076-303-271-715-610"},{"lens_id":"078-407-023-029-477"},{"lens_id":"089-064-920-667-118"},{"lens_id":"102-424-326-687-39X"},{"lens_id":"103-012-161-375-712"},{"lens_id":"104-963-683-392-202"},{"lens_id":"113-830-545-572-413"},{"lens_id":"122-479-711-922-142"},{"lens_id":"125-795-343-058-314"},{"lens_id":"138-332-915-687-580"},{"lens_id":"140-109-678-513-738"},{"lens_id":"141-625-096-824-701"},{"lens_id":"169-380-214-360-631"},{"lens_id":"170-912-030-345-381"}],"scholarly_citations_count":6,"source":{"country":"Hungary","issn":[{"type":"print","value":"01389130"},{"type":"electronic","value":"15882861"}],"publisher":"Springer Netherlands","title_full":"Scientometrics"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"3117","title":"Industry 5.0: improving humanization and sustainability of Industry 4.0.","volume":"127","year_published":2022},{"abstract":"Introduction: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is of paramount importance for the early diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and MRI findings are part of the MS diagnostic criteria.

increasingly known as a significant concern around the world. It has been described as a constituent activity that contributes to a significant impact on the environment. However, the concept of sustainable management is yet to be well received by the hotel industry in Malaysia. This paper aims to study the growing idea of Sustainable Facilities Management (SFM) adoption, specifically in the hotel industry. This paper provides valuable information on the theory of SFM evolution, including the meta-analysis on the SFM developing, trends and researchers around the world. This paper identified a total of 15 hospitality initiatives utilized around the globe, with only nine of them are currently employed and adopted by the hotel industry. These initiatives are essential that need to be implemented in a hotel organization to gain successful and holistic SFM practices adoption.Keywords: Sustainable; Sustainability Facilities Management (SFM); Hotel. eISSN: 2398-4287 © 2019.

Thus, causing waste that fills the land and sea. Not only waste from humans, but the Indonesian sea also produces marine biota waste that is usually stranded on the coasts. Waste of marine life on Santolo Beach, Garut, produces a negative impact on public health and causes environmental disturbance if left around the beach as only a part of it is decomposed in the soil and the rest remains as waste. The purpose of this paper is to design jewelry that also has a traceable supply chain, and can also contribute to the welfare of the environment and local community of Sagaranten, Sukabumi. This can be interpreted as halal jewellery. The author interprets and reinterprets the ethical halal to be applied to jewelry to be Halal in the context of Sustainable Product Design (SPD). This SPD will demonstrate the meaning of halal jewelry by processing, environmentally friendly materials as well as various other considerations in the social and economic fields to achieve sustainable profit-making products.","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"G.

In this chapter, the applications of supercritical fluid technology and algal biomass technology are highlighted. Supercritical fluid technology is a carbon-neutral technology that is highly unique and versatile which supports the notions of biomanufacturing in the bioeconomy concept. Besides replacing conventional extraction methods, supercritical fluids can be applied towards enzymatic pretreatment and activation, biological membrane synthesis and bioalcohol recovery due to its non-reactive, non-flammable and clean separation properties. On the other hand, the potential of algal biomass technology in bioenergy production such as bio-lipids and biohydrogen can be exploited due to the intrinsic properties of microalgae that acts as a backbone in the bioremediation of gaseous greenhouse gases. Furthermore, microalgae technology can be integrated into existing traditional refineries to act similar to a separator that captures unwanted emissions and converts them into value-added products.","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Yee Ho","initials":"YH","last_name":"Chai"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Guo Yong","initials":"GY","last_name":"Yew"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Suzana","initials":"S","last_name":"Yusup"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Pau Loke","initials":"PL","last_name":"Show"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2021-05-19T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"286","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Biohydrogen"},{"name":"Supercritical fluid"},{"name":"Bioenergy"},{"name":"Biochemical engineering"},{"name":"Oil refinery"},{"name":"Biomanufacturing"},{"name":"Biomass"},{"name":"Extraction methods"},{"name":"Environmental science"},{"name":"Greenhouse gas"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"009-241-255-760-322","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"book chapter","references":[{"lens_id":"087-682-287-335-34X"}],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[],"publisher":"CRC Press","title_full":"The Prospect of Industry 5.0 in Biomanufacturing"},"source_urls":[{"type":"html","url":"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781003080671-12-12/state-art-technologies-industry-5-0-yee-ho-chai-guo-yong-yew-suzana-yusup-pau-loke-show"}],"start_page":"257","title":"State-of-the-Art Technologies in Industry 5.0","volume":null,"year_published":2021},{"abstract":"The society increasingly based on digital culture is already an unavoidable reality. This paper aims to contribute, in a preliminary way, to understand several of the implications in Sociology that this propagation of digital culture involves through a bibliographical review. We analyse several implications in dimensions such as the very purpose of Sociology (highlighting digital literacy and the level of democracy) and social research (addressing issues raised by the big date, the interdisciplinary dialogue between Sociology and other scientific areas, and new ethical dilemmas). We conclude that there are profound implications both in the research object and in the research processes of Sociology, which we will develop in later phases of the dissemination of this research. As a major implication, the reflective capacity of sociological knowledge is central to the preparation for this new reality, but, at the same time, also to a well-founded critical understanding of digital society.","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Carlos Miguel","initials":"CM","last_name":"Ferreira"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2019-04-22T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"106","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Sociology"},{"name":"Digital literacy"},{"name":"Research Object"},{"name":"Digital culture"},{"name":"Digital society"},{"name":"Social research"},{"name":"Democracy"},{"name":"Engineering ethics"}],"funding":[],"issue":"3","keywords":[],"lens_id":"009-261-537-498-842","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"022-146-159-357-985"},{"lens_id":"057-465-955-232-831"},{"lens_id":"065-454-781-114-304"}],"scholarly_citations_count":3,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"23248041"},{"type":"print","value":"23248033"}],"publisher":"Redfame Publishing","title_full":"International Journal of Social Science Studies"},"source_urls":[{"type":"pdf","url":"https://redfame.com/journal/index.php/ijsss/article/download/4221/4397"},{"type":"html","url":"https://redfame.com/journal/index.php/ijsss/article/view/4221/4397"},{"type":"html","url":"https://ideas.repec.org/a/rfa/journl/v7y2019i3p101-106.html"},{"type":"core_fulltext","url":"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/228083965.pdf"}],"start_page":"101","title":"Sociology and Digital Culture","volume":"7","year_published":2019},{"abstract":"<jats:p>Smart machine companions such as artificial intelligence (AI) assistants and collaborative robots are rapidly populating the factory floor. Future factory floor workers will work in teams that include both human co-workers and smart machine actors. The visions of Industry 5.0 describe sustainable, resilient, and human-centered future factories that will require smart and resilient capabilities both from next-generation manufacturing systems and human operators. What kinds of approaches can help design these kinds of resilient human–machine teams and collaborations within them? In this paper, we analyze this design challenge, and we propose basing the design on the joint cognitive systems approach. The established joint cognitive systems approach can be complemented with approaches that support human centricity in the early phases of design, as well as in the development of continuously co-evolving human–machine teams. We propose approaches to observing and analyzing the collaboration in human–machine teams, developing the concept of operations with relevant stakeholders, and including ethical aspects in the design and development. We base our work on the joint cognitive systems approach and propose complementary approaches and methods, namely: actor–network theory, the concept of operations and ethically aware design. We identify their possibilities and challenges in designing and developing smooth human–machine teams for Industry 5.0 manufacturing systems.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"FI"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I87653560"},{"type":"ror","value":"04b181w54"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.6324.3"}],"name":"VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Eija","initials":"E","last_name":"Kaasinen"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":null}],"name":"Finnish Industrial Union, 00531 Helsinki, Finland"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Anu-Hanna","initials":"A","last_name":"Anttila"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"FI"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I87653560"},{"type":"ror","value":"04b181w54"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.6324.3"}],"name":"VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Päivi","initials":"P","last_name":"Heikkilä"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"FI"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I87653560"},{"type":"ror","value":"04b181w54"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.6324.3"}],"name":"VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Jari","initials":"J","last_name":"Laarni"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"FI"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I87653560"},{"type":"ror","value":"04b181w54"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.6324.3"}],"name":"VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Hanna","initials":"H","last_name":"Koskinen"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"FI"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I87653560"},{"type":"ror","value":"04b181w54"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.6324.3"}],"name":"VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Antti","initials":"A","last_name":"Väätänen"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-02-26T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"2773","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Factory (object-oriented programming)"},{"name":"Vision"},{"name":"Teamwork"},{"name":"Human–machine system"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Knowledge management"},{"name":"Industry 4.0"},{"name":"Joint (building)"},{"name":"Human intelligence"},{"name":"Engineering"},{"name":"Process management"},{"name":"Engineering management"},{"name":"Artificial intelligence"},{"name":"Systems engineering"}],"funding":[],"issue":"5","keywords":[],"lens_id":"009-851-433-625-819","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"004-244-741-588-494"},{"lens_id":"005-744-982-702-558"},{"lens_id":"008-461-355-056-410"},{"lens_id":"011-706-935-997-445"},{"lens_id":"012-069-194-614-925"},{"lens_id":"017-459-070-179-170"},{"lens_id":"021-378-205-052-792"},{"lens_id":"022-023-237-030-946"},{"lens_id":"024-789-607-081-823"},{"lens_id":"024-895-641-633-117"},{"lens_id":"029-170-236-791-182"},{"lens_id":"036-542-045-061-441"},{"lens_id":"038-958-306-682-775"},{"lens_id":"039-234-402-137-091"},{"lens_id":"040-523-322-834-731"},{"lens_id":"045-830-443-220-746"},{"lens_id":"061-508-236-488-840"},{"lens_id":"061-974-448-733-340"},{"lens_id":"067-406-388-589-502"},{"lens_id":"081-034-990-695-773"},{"lens_id":"085-026-809-878-651"},{"lens_id":"117-812-700-190-439"}],"scholarly_citations_count":6,"source":{"country":"Switzerland","issn":[{"type":"print","value":"20711050"}],"publisher":"MDPI AG","title_full":"Sustainability"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"2773","title":"Smooth and Resilient Human–Machine Teamwork as an Industry 5.0 Design Challenge","volume":"14","year_published":2022},{"abstract":"<jats:p>The presented article points to the combination of mixed reality with advanced robotics and manipulators.

Digital twin (DT), referring to the virtual representation of a physical object, is well-perceived as a key driver in the development of PI-based Supply Chain Management (SCM). Due to the capabilities of real-time monitoring and evaluation of large-scale complex systems, significant research efforts have been made to exploit values of PI/DT in SCM. Despite this, the current literature remained largely unstructured and scattered due to a lack of systematic literature reviews to synergise research findings, analyse the evolution of research fronts and extract emerging trends in the field. To address this issue, the paper deploys a bibliometric knowledge mapping approach to provide a bird's eye view of the current research status in the PI/DT-SCM area. Using CiteSpace's keyword co-occurrence network, 518 journal articles are clustered into 10 key research streams on PI/DT applications in: job shop scheduling, smart manufacturing design, PI-based SCM, manufacturing virtualisation, information management, sustainability development, data analytics, manufacturing operations management, simulation and optimisation, and assembly process planning. Based on citation burst rate, keywords representing research frontiers of the PI/DT are detected and their temporal evolutions are discussed. Likewise, some identified emerging research trends are production process and system, robotics, computer architecture, and cost. Finally, seven future research directions are suggested, which emphasise on several PI/DT-related issues, including business ecosystem, sustainability development, SC downstream management, cognitive thinking in Industry 5.0, citizen twin in digital society, and SC resilience.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"GB"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I55060895"},{"type":"ror","value":"00bmj0a71"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.36316.31"}],"name":"University

framework rooted in society 5.0 perspectives in Taiwan. The SSWM-related causal interrelationships within the proposed hierarchical structure, and critical barriers for the practical improvement and enhancement of SSWM performance are identified as preference enriching both literature and practices. In nature, the hierarchical structure is with the causal interrelationships under uncertainties. The perspective empowers the creation of a new biosphere based on technological progress, but in the sustainable solid waste management field, it is difficult to encounter and shape the systematized processes due to barriers and challenges. To address this shortcoming, this study evaluates the technical challenges faced in the field of sustainable solid waste management toward society 5.0. The valid attributes are usually described the qualitative information. The fuzzy Delphi method is applied to acquire the valid and reliable attributes. Fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory experiment is to visualize the causal interrelationships among the attributes. Choquet integral with respect to the nonadditive attributes over the valid set provides an overall perspective function. The results establish an understanding of sustainable solid waste management barriers in the perspectives under uncertainties. Community uncertainty, policy and regulation problems, city architecture, and technology interaction are the factors that influence sustainable performance. In practices, (1) diverse disciplines and sectors in local, national, and global communities; (2) a lack of mobility and reliability; (3) mass production and mass consumption; (4) an insufficient level of artificial intelligence application; and (5) failures related to data management and security hinder the improvement of sustainable solid waste management toward society 5.0. The social and technical perspectives are indicated as the top priorities to improve SSWM performance.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"TW"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"143578492"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.252470.6"},{"type":"ror","value":"038a1tp19"}],"name":"Asia University (Taiwan)"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Tat-Dat","initials":"T","last_name":"Bui"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"TW"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"143578492"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.252470.6"},{"type":"ror","value":"038a1tp19"}],"name":"Asia University (Taiwan)"},{"addresses":[{"country_code":"TW"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"184693016"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.254145.3"},{"type":"ror","value":"00v408z34"}],"name":"China Medical University (Taiwan)"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Ming-Lang","initials":"M","last_name":"Tseng"}],"chemicals":[{"mesh_id":"D062611","registry_number":"0","substance_name":"Solid Waste"}],"date_published":{"date":"2021-10-14T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"29","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Choquet integral"},{"name":"Risk analysis (engineering)"},{"name":"Architecture"},{"name":"Technological change"},{"name":"Data management"},{"name":"Structure (mathematical logic)"},{"name":"Production (economics)"},{"name":"Preference"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Function (engineering)"}],"funding":[],"issue":"11","keywords":[{"value":"Choquet integral"},{"value":"Fuzzy Delphi method"},{"value":"Fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory"},{"value":"Society 5.0 perspective"},{"value":"Sustainable solid waste management"}],"lens_id":"010-873-590-010-001","mesh_terms":[{"mesh_heading":"Artificial Intelligence","mesh_id":"D001185","qualifier_id":null,"qualifier_name":null},{"mesh_heading":"Refuse Disposal","mesh_id":"D012037","qualifier_id":null,"qualifier_name":null},{"mesh_heading":"Reproducibility of Results","mesh_id":"D015203","qualifier_id":null,"qualifier_name":null},{"mesh_heading":"Solid Waste","mesh_id":"D062611","qualifier_id":null,"qualifier_name":null},{"mesh_heading":"Uncertainty","mesh_id":"D035501","qualifier_id":null,"qualifier_name":null},{"mesh_heading":"Waste Management","mesh_id":"D018505","qualifier_id":null,"qualifier_name":null}],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"011-914-928-178-27X"},{"lens_id":"015-543-302-548-721"},{"lens_id":"019-096-526-386-120"},{"lens_id":"019-763-285-018-963"},{"lens_id":"019-945-777-878-166"},{"lens_id":"025-994-936-829-651"},{"lens_id":"030-108-731-276-821"},{"lens_id":"034-204-621-111-626"},{"lens_id":"036-297-026-204-017"},{"lens_id":"039-709-279-022-980"},{"lens_id":"045-959-768-453-254"},{"lens_id":"046-372-943-496-280"},{"lens_id":"047-297-572-744-247"},{"lens_id":"048-856-582-248-970"},{"lens_id":"054-721-501-846-186"},{"lens_id":"055-554-280-488-450"},{"lens_id":"055-972-303-070-981"},{"lens_id":"060-308-760-342-386"},{"lens_id":"060-864-133-839-198"},{"lens_id":"062-757-415-379-846"},{"lens_id":"063-374-877-312-433"},{"lens_id":"066-041-618-466-167"},{"lens_id":"068-249-176-115-17X"},{"lens_id":"070-417-358-705-893"},{"lens_id":"070-842-827-776-000"},{"lens_id":"073-222-646-090-810"},{"lens_id":"079-919-116-621-379"},{"lens_id":"081-144-427-432-971"},{"lens_id":"085-780-393-602-137"},{"lens_id":"085-855-980-761-312"},{"lens_id":"087-614-892-791-322"},{"lens_id":"092-407-096-308-44X"},{"lens_id":"109-974-366-952-574"},{"lens_id":"110-475-164-406-97X"},{"lens_id":"116-755-794-349-118"},{"lens_id":"121-843-353-245-98X"},{"lens_id":"123-072-180-836-086"},{"lens_id":"123-106-661-516-297"},{"lens_id":"125-228-861-646-57X"},{"lens_id":"128-088-669-124-955"},{"lens_id":"134-116-139-715-961"},{"lens_id":"134-679-223-732-173"},{"lens_id":"138-283-362-828-380"},{"lens_id":"147-293-091-229-102"},{"lens_id":"155-331-610-682-393"},{"lens_id":"171-424-541-004-742"},{"lens_id":"180-813-779-294-458"}],"scholarly_citations_count":8,"source":{"country":"Germany","issn":[{"type":"unknown","value":"16147499"},{"type":"print","value":"09441344"}],"publisher":"Springer Science + Business Media","title_full":"Environmental science and pollution research international"},"source_urls":[{"type":"html","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34648164/"},{"type":"html","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-021-16962-0/tables/1"}],"start_page":"1","title":"Understanding the barriers to sustainable solid waste management in society 5.0 under uncertainties: a novelty of socials and technical perspectives on performance driving.","volume":"29","year_published":2021},{"abstract":"Mathematization of research is one of the most effective methods of virtual substantiation of foodstuff recipe and technology. This approach allows creating a product that meets consumer's individual needs, i.e. personalized foodstuff (ethnicity, cultural preferences, regional and environmental characteristics, lifestyle), and at the same time reducing the time and cost of decision-making. The article discusses the hypothesis that the “digital twin” of a food product is a virtual model of the product, namely its mathematical model (simulation model). A simulation model is a logical and mathematical description of a food product that is used to conduct a computerized experiment in order to design desired characteristics and properties. The “digital twin” combines all variety of factors from chemical composition, functional and technological properties to organoleptic indicators. The application of the “digital twin” model of the foodstuff will allow: (1) reacting quickly to changes in the composition, properties and types of raw ingredients, (2) adjusting the product recipe in response to changes in consumer preferences, (3) designing products with a given chemical composition, nutritional value and functional orientation, (4) creating functional, specialized products taking into account the metabolism of nutrients (ethnicity, cultural preferences, health status and clinical factors). Products adapted to the needs of small categories of people will help reducing the risks for those who already have diseases, and will meet the needs of those who would like to make their diet more appropriate to individual needs. The proposed approach to creating a model of the “digital twin” of the foodstuff includes several stages. The first stage involves optimization of the nutritional and biological value of the designed product. The second stage is related to designing the food product’s structural forms. But even if the recipe of a food product is optimally selected in the first stage, it does not guarantee its transformation during processing into a stable system with the required structural, mechanical, functional and technological parameters. Evaluation of the developed food product’s efficiency is possible only by analysing numerous and various parameters and indicators. It is convenient to generalize (convolute) many parameters and indicators into a single quantitative dimensionless indicator. To assess the quality and adequacy of the food product, it is suggested to use an integral indicator in the form of additive convolution – the ‘functional’ of the food product quality.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"V.

The general scheme of the integrated model of sustainable and socio-humanitarian development in the global system is proposed, which the authors call the noosphere model of sustainable and safe development as an important fundamental platform for the design and creation of AIS. In the XXI century education, science and innova- tive technologies becomes the «basis» of the spiritual and material reproduction of man, transforming the society of the XXI century into an educational society, ensures compliance with the law of advanced development of human quality, quality of social intelligence and quality of educational systems in society. noosphere evolution (Субетто, 2008). Industry 4.0 is the next stage in the digitalization of production technologies with the accelerated introduction of new developments and cyberphysical systems, which is changing business models. Accordingly, Industry 4.0 as a separate segment of digital manufacturing technologies takes its place among other digital sectors. The analysis of the Strategies and Concepts developed in the world in modern directions: innovative economy, digital economy, artificial intelli- gence, Industry 4.0 and others is carried out in the work. The problem is to determine the initial fundamental para- meters of order and their prospects in the global world, the definition and principles of artificial intelligence systems (AIS), its structure and important aspects and principles of future science and technology in analysis and synthesis ba- sed on synergetic approaches, innovative, information, converged technologies, taking into account the design of future and viable and safe and sustainable development in the context of Industry 4.0, DE and Society 5.0. The main scientific and technological factors in the 21st century will be the development of: Artificial Intelligence, Nano Technologies, Bio-Media Technologies, Cognitive Technologies and Socio-Humanitarian Technologies. More specifically – this is the modern development of Innovative Technologies: «NBIC SH». Therefore, it is necessary to note the importance of taking into account the principle of I2K2+SH, ie: Intellectualization, Integration, Convergence, Coevolution and Socio- humanitarian technologies. It is important and necessary to take into account modern principles of designing a su- stainable and secure AIS and solving the problem of Harmonization between 2 worlds: Real and Virtual, especially in their hybridization. Our immediate future is a hybrid nonlinear world. Note that digitalization, artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics will be the main drivers of global economic growth by 2030E. An important paradigm and platform is the Integrated System: for Industry 4.0, DE and AI, taking into account the complex principle of I2K2+SH.

As an example, we looked at the resource-sharing problem typical of economic activities and assumed the distribution of individual actions to define the (1) norm function fostered through mutual comparison of value/action ratio based on the equity theory (progressive tax-like), (2) norm function proportional to resource utilization (proportional tax-like) and (3) fixed norm function independent of resource utilization (fixed tax-like). By carrying out numerical simulation, we showed that the progressive tax-like norm function (i) does not increase disparity for the distribution of the actions, unlike the other norm functions, and (ii) has high resource productivity and low Gini coefficient. Therefore the progressive tax-like norm function has the highest sustainability and fairness.","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Takeshi","initials":"T","last_name":"Kato"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Yasuyuki","initials":"Y","last_name":"Kudo"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Junichi","initials":"J","last_name":"Miyakoshi"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Jun","initials":"J","last_name":"Otsuka"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Hayato","initials":"H","last_name":"Saigo"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Kaori","initials":"K","last_name":"Karasawa"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Hiroyuki","initials":"H","last_name":"Yamaguchi"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Yoshinori","initials":"Y","last_name":"Hiroi"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Yasuo","initials":"Y","last_name":"Deguchi"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2020-04-23T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"114","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Norm (social)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization"},{"name":"Gini coefficient"},{"name":"Decision-making models"},{"name":"Mutual recognition"},{"name":"Resource utilization"},{"name":"Mathematics"},{"name":"Equity theory"},{"name":"Sustainability"},{"name":"Resource productivity"}],"funding":[],"issue":"3","keywords":[],"lens_id":"013-807-639-981-508","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"004-545-338-240-85X"},{"lens_id":"007-191-349-791-474"},{"lens_id":"007-437-980-745-880"},{"lens_id":"010-332-589-194-999"},{"lens_id":"011-882-911-145-929"},{"lens_id":"012-962-885-974-665"},{"lens_id":"045-212-803-345-983"},{"lens_id":"054-065-378-815-209"},{"lens_id":"062-735-979-667-571"},{"lens_id":"063-725-226-097-989"},{"lens_id":"063-862-591-134-240"},{"lens_id":"070-733-823-215-158"},{"lens_id":"073-933-963-335-712"},{"lens_id":"078-341-709-997-73X"},{"lens_id":"078-362-374-834-789"},{"lens_id":"081-050-134-994-930"},{"lens_id":"086-205-801-972-088"},{"lens_id":"095-975-856-131-048"},{"lens_id":"096-623-595-192-834"},{"lens_id":"109-991-058-110-214"},{"lens_id":"124-784-188-982-725"},{"lens_id":"152-126-041-220-508"},{"lens_id":"156-193-184-347-069"},{"lens_id":"156-765-044-924-988"},{"lens_id":"159-419-280-815-190"},{"lens_id":"175-602-270-496-697"}],"scholarly_citations_count":3,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"23327308"},{"type":"print","value":"23327294"}],"publisher":"Redfame Publishing","title_full":"Applied Economics and Finance"},"source_urls":[{"type":"html","url":"https://redfame.com/journal/index.php/aef/article/view/4825"},{"type":"pdf","url":"https://redfame.com/journal/index.php/aef/article/download/4825/4986"},{"type":"html","url":"https://ideas.repec.org/a/rfa/aefjnl/v7y2020i3p96-114.html"},{"type":"core_fulltext","url":"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/322535333.pdf"}],"start_page":"96","title":"Sustainability and Fairness Simulations Based on Decision-Making Model of Utility Function and Norm Function","volume":"7","year_published":2020},{"abstract":"Abstract Emerging technologies such as cloud computing, augmented and virtual reality, artificial intelligence and robotics, among others, are transforming the field of manufacturing and industry as a whole in unprecedent ways.

For this reason, our research goal was to analyze the key performance indicators to investigate the economic and social sustainability of the changes in production. Methodology: The combination of official (World Bank, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) and publicly available (Federal Reserve Economic Data, Industrial Federation of Robotics) data was used for statistical data processing, including comparison, correlation, cross-correlation and vector autoregression analysis, to present the past develop­ments and also to predict future trends within the U.S. manufacturing sector. Results: In contrast to robust industry robotization observed in the 2008–2018 period, the share of manufacturing output and employment declined. Nonetheless, the vector autoregression model forecast shows, that the U.S. manu­facturing sector has arrived at a turning point, after which robotization can increase employment and labor productivi­ty of workers, while also stimulating further growth of their education levels. Conclusion: The transition to Industry 4.0 has a major impact on increasing demands for new knowledge and skills for increased productivity. Accordingly, forecasted growths of analyzed manufacturing indicators suggest that negative impacts of robotization in the recent past were only temporary, due to the entrance to the Industry 4.0 era. Nonetheless, additional policies to support sustainable industry development are required.

Block-chain brings positive impact on the development of businesses in Indonesia, but it also has negative impacts if the government of Indonesia doesn�t keep an eye on it. The Positive impacts are that block-chain can improve the efficiency of time and transactions fee. But on the other hand, block-chain gives opportunity to the beginning of cybercrime, for example data theft, client�s financial data. The formulation of problems are: 1. What is the urgency of the establishment of law concerning block-chain technology utilization in Indonesia based on the perspective of dignified justice; 2. What kind of legal protection should be established concerning consumer and business founder protection on the utilization block-chain technology. This research method is a normative empirical method conducted the way of analyzing norms, the laws and regulation on regarding the topic and with profound interviews with experts/officials who has decent knowledge in this specific area. The purpose of this research is to analyze the consumer and founder protection related on the usage of block-chain and to give an input to the ministry on the urgency of the formation of the law on blockchain in Indonesia. The results of this study are that the blockchain technology has been used in various businesses, such as financial / banking sector, agriculture, etc. Blockchain technology can change the paradigm in the financial sector from a centralized system to a decentralized system and to improve system security. Blockchain must be monitored because the blockchain system contained data privacy, financial privacy to prevent the criminal acts. The conclusion is that the supervision of the blockchain system is carried out by forming special regulations on the blockchain or adding new norms which are based on the dignified justice about blockchain in Bank Indonesia Regulations or Financial Services Authority Regulations related to financial technology.Keywords: Blockchain, Consumers Protection, Money Laundering, Renewal Law, Justice Dignity (Keadilan Bermartabat)Urgensi Pembentukan Peraturan Perundang-Undangan Terkait Teknologi Blockchain di Indonesia berdasarkan Keadilan BermartabatAbstrakTeknologi blockchain telah banyak dimanfaatkan di berbagai negara di dunia, khususnya di Indonesia. Penggunaan blockchain membawa dampak positif bagi pengembangan dunia bisnis di Indonesia, namun juga memiliki dampak negatif jika tidak diawasi oleh baik oleh Pemerintah Indonesia. Dampak positif penggunaan blockchain dapat meningkatkan efisiensi waktu, biaya lalu lintas transaksi keuangan. Namun disatu sisi, blockchain menimbulkan dampak negatif yakni membuka peluang munculnya kejahatan dunia maya (cybercrime) misalnya pencurian data privasi, data keuangan nasabah. Adapun yang menjadi rumusan masalah adalah: 1. Apakah yang menjadi urgensi pembentukan peraturan perundang-undangan terkait manfaat teknologi blockchain di Indonesia berdasarkan perspektif keadilan yang bermartabat; 2. Apa jenis perlindungan hukum yang perlu dibangun tentang perlindungan konsumer dan pelaku usaha dalam penggunaan teknologi block chain. Metode yang digunakan ialah normatif empiris yang dilakukan dengan cara menganalisis norma, peraturan perundang-undangan terhadap topik yang diangkat dan dengan metode wawancara yang mendalam kepada narasumber/pejabat yang memiliki kompetensi di bidang tersebut. Tujuan penelitian untuk menganalisis perlindungan konsumen &amp; pelaku usaha terkait penggunaan blockchain dan untuk memberi masukan bagi Kementerian terkait tentang urgensi pembentukan peraturan penggunaan blockchain di Indonesia. Hasil penelitian ini adalah teknologi blockchain telah dipergunakan di pelbagai usaha, baik di sektor keuangan/perbankan, pertanian dan lain sebagainya. Teknologi blockchain dapat merubah paradigma di sektor keuangan dari sistem sentralisasi menuju sistem desentralisasi dan untuk meningkatkan keamanan sistem. Blockchain wajib diawasi karena di dalam sistem blockchain terdapat privasi data, privasi keuangan dan agar tidak disalahgunakan untuk melakukan tindak pidana. Kesimpulannya adalah pengawasan sistem blockchain dilaksanakan dengan membentuk peraturan khusus tentang blockchain atau menambahkan norma baru yang berprinsipkan keadilan bermartabat tentang blockchain dalam Peraturan Bank Indonesia ataupun Peraturan Otoritas Jasa Keuangan yang terkait teknologi finansial.�Kata Kunci: Blockchain, Perlindungan Konsumen, Pencucian Uang, Pembaharuan Hukum, Keadilan Bermartabat</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"ID"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"102669525"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.443962.e"},{"type":"ror","value":"02qhjtc16"}],"name":"University of Pelita Harapan"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Teguh","initials":"T","last_name":"Prasetyo"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"ID"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"102669525"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.443962.e"},{"type":"ror","value":"02qhjtc16"}],"name":"University of Pelita Harapan"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Rizky P.P.

The “Industrie 4.0” initiative declared by Germany in 2011 was soon followed by the „Advanced Manufactured Partnership” program of the U.S., as well as by the “Made in China 2025” initiative for the advancement of the productive sector launched by the People’s Republic of China and the “Industria 2016” vision of Italy. The “Society 5.0” strategy of Japan announced in 2018 symbolizes both the destructing and the constructive power of the fourth industrial revolution which will result in a complete restructuring of all fields of economy and society. The evolution of Industry 4.0 is parallel to the conscious efforts of many European governments to develop their own start-up ecosystems. These start-ups face significant challenges, but at the same time, they are the means to support changes. Technology-oriented start-up companies (also referred as early stage start-ups in Hungary) are not only expected to prove their own reason for existence, but should also support the complex changes of the corporate sector. This paper is based on a survey among early stage start-up companies, having received angel investment from technology incubators. The survey has focused on how these start-ups see of the significance of Industry 4.0, what differences are evident compared to traditional companies, and what management competencies are thought to be required to realize their growth strategy.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"HU"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"227486990"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.9008.1"},{"type":"ror","value":"01pnej532"}],"name":"University of Szeged"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Peter","initials":"P","last_name":"Halmosi"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2019-09-16T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"48","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Humanities"},{"name":"Political science"},{"name":"Productive sector"}],"funding":[],"issue":"9","keywords":[],"lens_id":"017-191-644-573-480","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[],"scholarly_citations_count":1,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"print","value":"01330179"}],"publisher":"Corvinus University of Budapest","title_full":"Vezetéstudomány / Budapest Management Review"},"source_urls":[{"type":"pdf","url":"http://unipub.lib.uni-corvinus.hu/4234/1/VT_2019n9p40.pdf"},{"type":"html","url":"http://unipub.lib.uni-corvinus.hu/4234/"},{"type":"core_fulltext","url":"https://core.ac.uk/download/228207943.pdf"}],"start_page":"40","title":"A technológiaorientált start-up cégek lehetőségei és korlátai az Ipar 4.0 korszakában – kérdőíves felmérés alapján","volume":"50","year_published":2019},{"abstract":"Staying at the top is getting tougher and more challenging due to the fast-growing and changing digital technologies and AI-based solutions. The world of technology, mass customization, and advanced manufacturing is experiencing a rapid transformation. Robots are becoming even more important as they can now be coupled with the human mind by means of brain–machine interface and advances in artificial intelligence. A strong necessity to increase productivity while not removing human workers from the manufacturing industry is imposing punishing challenges on the global economy. To counter these challenges, this article introduces the concept of Industry 5.0, where robots are intertwined with the human brain and work as collaborator instead of competitor. This article also outlines a number of key features and concerns that every manufacturer may have about Industry 5.0. In addition, it presents several developments achieved by researchers for use in Industry 5.0 applications and environments. Finally, the impact of Industry 5.0 on the manufacturing industry and overall economy is discussed from an economic and productivity point of view, where it is argued that Industry 5.0 will create more jobs than it will take away.","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Saeid","initials":"S","last_name":"Nahavandi"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2019-08-13T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":null,"fields_of_study":[{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Manufacturing"},{"name":"Work (electrical)"},{"name":"Productivity"},{"name":"Interface (Java)"},{"name":"Human centric"},{"name":"Industrial organization"},{"name":"Mass customization"},{"name":"Advanced manufacturing"},{"name":"Robot"}],"funding":[],"issue":"16","keywords":[],"lens_id":"017-415-713-662-955","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"000-440-815-151-395"},{"lens_id":"000-452-908-115-500"},{"lens_id":"000-740-216-951-555"},{"lens_id":"005-557-619-034-272"},{"lens_id":"011-811-401-279-902"},{"lens_id":"017-791-317-547-292"},{"lens_id":"024-109-329-635-758"},{"lens_id":"032-580-282-493-653"},{"lens_id":"037-866-306-495-449"},{"lens_id":"038-061-333-446-448"},{"lens_id":"042-148-232-956-867"},{"lens_id":"043-947-207-151-749"},{"lens_id":"045-862-456-705-431"},{"lens_id":"059-852-258-632-082"},{"lens_id":"069-571-787-052-595"},{"lens_id":"070-213-475-682-454"},{"lens_id":"084-809-822-579-589"},{"lens_id":"085-488-273-694-817"},{"lens_id":"095-036-132-065-895"},{"lens_id":"103-145-034-667-818"},{"lens_id":"112-201-025-044-344"},{"lens_id":"132-780-724-767-837"}],"scholarly_citations_count":226,"source":{"country":"Switzerland","issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"20711050"}],"publisher":"MDPI AG","title_full":"Sustainability"},"source_urls":[{"type":"html","url":"https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jsusta/v11y2019i16p4371-d257067.html"},{"type":"html","url":"https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/85fc8454-bed2-3f25-8fe6-84e41d1a4497/"},{"type":"html","url":"http://dro.deakin.edu.au/view/DU:30129578"},{"type":"html","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/16/4371"},{"type":"unknown","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/16/4371/pdf"},{"type":"core_fulltext","url":"http://hdl.handle.net/10536/DRO/DU:30129578"}],"start_page":"4371","title":"Industry 5.0—A Human-Centric Solution","volume":"11","year_published":2019},{"abstract":"Background:Health information technology (IT) solutions can aid healthcare reform efforts, but without proper information management, these efforts are futile.

Hence, digital transformation becomes a pillar of industrial policy, known in Europe as “Industry 4.0,” in China as “made in China 2025,” in Asia as “Smart Cities,” in Japan as “Society 5.0,” and in North America as “Industrial Internet.” These transformations will change the industrial landscape, toward Quality 4.0 and therefore, our lives. The presented research was conducted on quality management employees in Portugal and it aims to analyze if such employees have the perception of the impact of Industry 4.0 in the quality management profession and the required and needed skills. After analyzing the answered questionnaires, 90 results were considered valid. This is the sample of our study. Simultaneously, the goal of this research is also to review and analyze the main topics in progress related to quality management for the fourth industrial revolution and how quality emerges of this change. The professionals that work on quality management must have creative thinking, be leaders, know how to communicate and work as a team, as well as, to have knowledge and understanding of ICT (Information and Communications Technology), and main pillars of Industry 4.0. These are the main findings. Besides that, they must know how to motivate their work teams, be open to change, know how to use Big Data to make decisions and above all, they must know how to manage conflicts. In addition, quality professionals must promote the design and production of first class products, be the defenders of their customers within the organization, and finally, they must create value for the stakeholders.","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Gilberto","initials":"G","last_name":"Santos"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"José

in economic growth. The goal of the paper is to analyze potential influencing factors on sustainable agribusiness. The research methodology included qualitative correlation and causation analysis, categorization and deduction. Datasets from credible sources were analyzed a Sustainable Agribusiness Trend Index (SATI) model was developed. Through analyzing the existing body of literature, analyzing previous and newest available data in the domain of agriculture and macro-economic indicators, as well through the developed SATI model, potential future trends in the domain of sustainable agribusiness are noted. Based on the results of the study it can be concluded that modern agribusiness requires a multi-aspect approach. Factors such as renewable water sources, human development index, GPD growth and many other present integral parts of sustainable agribusiness development.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Cariša","initials":"C","last_name":"Bešić"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Mihalj","initials":"M","last_name":"Bakator"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Dejan","initials":"D","last_name":"Đorđević"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Dragan","initials":"D","last_name":"Ćoćkalo"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Sanja","initials":"S","last_name":"Stanisavljev"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":null},"end_page":"383","fields_of_study":[],"funding":[],"issue":"2","keywords":[],"lens_id":"017-914-218-121-963","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"000-924-778-584-415"},{"lens_id":"006-708-801-466-479"},{"lens_id":"008-980-433-651-931"},{"lens_id":"011-914-928-178-27X"},{"lens_id":"014-268-407-391-396"},{"lens_id":"015-008-734-610-504"},{"lens_id":"015-579-896-701-109"},{"lens_id":"016-170-186-992-83X"},{"lens_id":"017-885-421-245-443"},{"lens_id":"019-641-673-987-808"},{"lens_id":"023-457-825-963-413"},{"lens_id":"026-326-997-844-137"},{"lens_id":"032-848-366-436-335"},{"lens_id":"040-921-609-303-237"},{"lens_id":"045-993-333-001-952"},{"lens_id":"051-858-699-508-980"},{"lens_id":"069-439-400-219-98X"},{"lens_id":"091-719-289-238-19X"},{"lens_id":"095-598-039-228-375"},{"lens_id":"097-451-393-311-32X"},{"lens_id":"108-899-208-011-054"},{"lens_id":"122-100-646-208-858"},{"lens_id":"135-611-105-757-199"},{"lens_id":"137-006-528-851-862"},{"lens_id":"138-067-806-311-328"},{"lens_id":"150-323-504-598-073"},{"lens_id":"176-855-655-516-427"},{"lens_id":"185-018-664-654-715"}],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"print","value":"03523462"},{"type":"electronic","value":"23348453"}],"publisher":"Centre for Evaluation in Education and Science (CEON/CEES)","title_full":"Ekonomika poljoprivrede"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"365","title":"Modern agribusiness within the framework of society 5.0","volume":"69","year_published":2022},{"abstract":"<jats:p>This article was to find out the character Muslim prioritizes in facing the Industrial Revolution Era 4.0 and Society 5.0 The data analysis technique in this study uses categorical statistics from the distribution of questionnaires in the Bandung area and it’s surroundings.

However, little has been done to understand how this ill-defined phenomenon may deliver its indented sustainability values despite these speculative promises. To address this knowledge gap, the present study developed a strategy roadmap that explains the mechanism by which Industry 5.0 delivers its intended sustainable development functions. The study first developed and introduced the Industry 5.0 reference model that describes the technical and functional properties of this phenomenon. The study further conducted a content-centric synthesis of the literature and identified the sustainable development functions of Industry 5.0. Next, the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique was employed to identify the sequential relationships among the functions and construct the Industry 5.0-enabled model of sustainable development. The ISM involved collecting the opinions of 11 Industry 5.0 experts through expert panel meetings. Results revealed that Industry 5.0 delivers sustainable development values through 16 functions. Circular intelligent products, employee technical assistance, intelligent automation, open sustainable innovation, renewable integration, and supply chain adaptability are examples of the functions identified. These functions are highly interrelated and should be developed in a specific order so that the synergies and complementarities among them would maximize the sustainable development value gains. The roadmap to Industry 5.0-driven sustainability developed in this study is expected to provide a better understanding of ways Industry 5.0 can contribute to sustainable development, explaining how the development of its functions should be managed to maximize their synergies and contribution to the intended sustainability values. The study also highlights important avenues for future research, emphasizing the potential enablers of Industry 5.0 development, such as Government 5.0 or Corporate Governance 5.0.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"LT"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I172574986"},{"type":"ror","value":"01me6gb93"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.6901.e"}],"name":"Kaunas University of Technology"},{"addresses":[{"country_code":"SE"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I123387679"},{"type":"ror","value":"048a87296"},{"type":"fundref","value":"501100007051"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.8993.b"}],"name":"Uppsala University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Morteza","initials":"M","last_name":"Ghobakhloo"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Mohammad","initials":"M","last_name":"Iranmanesh"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Muhammad Faraz","initials":"MF","last_name":"Mubarak"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Mobashar","initials":"M","last_name":"Mubarik"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Abderahman","initials":"A","last_name":"Rejeb"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Mehrbakhsh","initials":"M","last_name":"Nilashi"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":null},"end_page":"737","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Sustainability"},{"name":"Sustainable development"},{"name":"Adaptability"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Industry 4.0"},{"name":"Supply chain"},{"name":"Industrial organization"},{"name":"Process management"},{"name":"Knowledge management"},{"name":"Engineering"},{"name":"Management science"}],"funding":[{"country":null,"funding_id":null,"org":"Horizon 2020"},{"country":null,"funding_id":null,"org":"European Commission"}],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"018-537-060-605-321","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"003-739-483-177-307"},{"lens_id":"004-345-655-576-30X"},{"lens_id":"006-649-350-429-398"},{"lens_id":"009-851-433-625-819"},{"lens_id":"014-792-234-289-828"},{"lens_id":"014-934-290-898-725"},{"lens_id":"017-169-491-519-916"},{"lens_id":"017-415-713-662-955"},{"lens_id":"017-829-170-770-895"},{"lens_id":"023-807-371-911-412"},{"lens_id":"025-063-158-908-103"},{"lens_id":"025-485-766-400-282"},{"lens_id":"026-118-385-750-651"},{"lens_id":"027-519-650-344-683"},{"lens_id":"029-434-241-679-095"},{"lens_id":"033-851-018-944-660"},{"lens_id":"040-659-213-429-991"},{"lens_id":"042-568-416-652-13X"},{"lens_id":"047-735-862-933-748"},{"lens_id":"048-092-008-205-493"},{"lens_id":"064-138-810-036-202"},{"lens_id":"067-215-875-080-779"},{"lens_id":"070-609-833-244-587"},{"lens_id":"071-881-107-064-417"},{"lens_id":"072-759-433-132-777"},{"lens_id":"076-588-439-491-879"},{"lens_id":"078-273-948-762-696"},{"lens_id":"080-621-339-793-673"},{"lens_id":"085-402-064-678-597"},{"lens_id":"086-200-251-461-001"},{"lens_id":"090-332-878-930-771"},{"lens_id":"095-372-463-753-986"},{"lens_id":"098-221-028-633-307"},{"lens_id":"098-319-766-113-317"},{"lens_id":"104-407-152-275-456"},{"lens_id":"113-830-545-572-413"},{"lens_id":"115-035-917-580-95X"},{"lens_id":"115-664-965-881-484"},{"lens_id":"125-795-343-058-314"},{"lens_id":"136-239-393-075-894"},{"lens_id":"137-395-216-182-331"},{"lens_id":"138-332-915-687-580"},{"lens_id":"140-109-678-513-738"},{"lens_id":"142-998-026-914-988"},{"lens_id":"148-631-753-420-295"},{"lens_id":"152-707-246-845-89X"},{"lens_id":"153-662-522-509-72X"},{"lens_id":"169-612-087-067-722"},{"lens_id":"173-852-448-163-988"},{"lens_id":"190-742-604-017-384"}],"scholarly_citations_count":1,"source":{"country":"Netherlands","issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"23525509"}],"publisher":"Elsevier BV","title_full":"Sustainable Production and Consumption"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"716","title":"Identifying industry 5.0 contributions to sustainable development: A strategy roadmap for delivering sustainability values","volume":"33","year_published":2022},{"abstract":"<jats:p>Dear distinguished Authors and Guests,</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The organizing committee warmly welcome you to The 2<jats:sup>nd</jats:sup> UPY International Conference on Applied Science and Education (UPINCASE), held on 3 – 4 November 2020 in Yogyakarta, Indonesia virtually.

The main prerequisites for the emergence of the Industry 5.0 concept are studied, in particular, extensive digitization and the dynamic development of technologies of the fourth industrial revolution, which has led to the certain dehumanization of industry and has increased the interest of the scientific community in the aspects of industrial humanization, human-centeredness of industry, stability, sustainability, and resilience. The main principles and trends of the development of Industry 5.0, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, geopolitical crises, and disruptions of the global value chains on the condition and prospects for the development of world industry, new rules and requirements for global product manufacturers, technological innovations, and production trends are studied. The author identifies directions for expanding the concept of Industry 4.0 to include humanization, sustainability, and resilience. The rapid development of new technologies often outpaces the ability of organizations to align their development priorities with it and effectively take advantage of new opportunities, which leads to the need to navigate the changing business environment in time and develop a relevant development strategy. With so many technological changes, changing workforce demands, and social and regulatory priorities, there is a need to define guiding principles to help set the course for the digital industry. Industry 5.0 has become the basis for revising the future of energy, manufacturing, and mobility of supply chains, which rest on the foundations laid by Industry 4.0. The weaknesses of the Industry 4.0 concept, especially in terms of the role of a human in \"smart\" production and ensuring sustainable development are outlined. Accordingly, the expediency of further research and implementation of the Industry 5.0 concept is substantiated. On the basis of the conducted research on the implementation of Industry 5.0 and the world trends of industrial development, the author justifies the feasibility of reorienting production and business activities to human-centeredness as a new norm, strengthening sustainability, in particular, careful planning of stabilization measures in case of disruption of the global value chains – from factory facilities to network supplier, to transport channels, to regulatory and geopolitical changes, ensuring sustainability with manufacturers rethinking their impact on natural resources in connection with the expansion of the regulatory and legislative framework and investors' attention to reducing carbon emissions and negative impact on the environment.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Dolishniy Institute of Regional Research of NAS of Ukraine"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Nataliya O.","initials":"NO","last_name":"Ryvak"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":null},"end_page":"46","fields_of_study":[],"funding":[],"issue":"3(155)","keywords":[],"lens_id":"022-371-894-631-478","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"080-811-727-052-09X"},{"lens_id":"151-713-702-079-012"}],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"print","value":"20714653"}],"publisher":"State Institution - Institute of regional research named after M.I.

One of the changes is how people get information from a large amount of data to be used in the public development sector. Public policy, as a solution to solve various public problems, needs to be supported by accurate data and information facts. With a massive amount of data, this has an impact on public sector organizations to be able to store and analyze various types of information for public policies consideration. The term 'Society 5.0' has emerged, a concept that refers to revolution in people's lives through the use of technology by considering the humanities aspect. The potential for the huge benefits of big data technology is interesting to know as to whether big data can be used for the public policy formulation process. Therefore, this article will provide an overview of the implications of big data for the public policy process in society. This research uses qualitative method with literature study approach. The data came from websites and government documents related to the use of big data in public policies, analyzed using the NVivo12 Plus application. The emergence of big data, as a basis for making public policy, can be utilized for analysis, which includes social data analysis, historical data analysis, and predictive data analysis which can influence accuracy in the policy decision making. Public policy in the era of society 5.0 is vital to be realized through the use of big data as a source of information supported by technology and the readiness of actors in the policy-making process.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"ID"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"226567900"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.444658.f"},{"type":"ror","value":"03anrkt33"}],"name":"Muhammadiyah University of Yogyakarta"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Fajar","initials":"F","last_name":"Rahmanto"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"ID"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"226567900"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.444658.f"},{"type":"ror","value":"03anrkt33"}],"name":"Muhammadiyah University of Yogyakarta"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Ulung","initials":"U","last_name":"Pribadi"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"ID"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"226567900"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.444658.f"},{"type":"ror","value":"03anrkt33"}],"name":"Muhammadiyah University of Yogyakarta"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Agus","initials":"A","last_name":"Priyanto"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2021-03-01T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":null,"fields_of_study":[{"name":"Public policy"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Public sector"},{"name":"Government"},{"name":"Social data analysis"},{"name":"Policy decision"},{"name":"Public relations"},{"name":"Process (engineering)"},{"name":"Modernization theory"},{"name":"Big data"}],"funding":[],"issue":"1","keywords":[],"lens_id":"022-493-466-273-278","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"006-574-173-774-751"},{"lens_id":"010-329-427-568-268"},{"lens_id":"010-693-556-170-994"},{"lens_id":"011-360-018-404-299"},{"lens_id":"016-172-387-726-764"},{"lens_id":"018-145-485-196-030"},{"lens_id":"022-693-065-127-516"},{"lens_id":"025-444-259-182-777"},{"lens_id":"030-284-484-325-034"},{"lens_id":"033-656-605-806-322"},{"lens_id":"035-335-085-906-674"},{"lens_id":"044-698-440-525-155"},{"lens_id":"046-855-617-630-807"},{"lens_id":"060-167-019-499-712"},{"lens_id":"073-686-229-467-053"},{"lens_id":"089-502-739-796-203"},{"lens_id":"100-087-652-982-645"},{"lens_id":"132-414-818-360-149"},{"lens_id":"153-537-966-160-490"},{"lens_id":"157-593-008-676-380"},{"lens_id":"185-103-342-584-132"}],"scholarly_citations_count":1,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"print","value":"17551307"},{"type":"electronic","value":"17551315"}],"publisher":"IOP Publishing","title_full":"IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science"},"source_urls":[{"type":"html","url":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/717/1/012009"},{"type":"pdf","url":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/717/1/012009/pdf"}],"start_page":"012009","title":"Big Data: What are the Implications for Public Sector Policy in Society 5.0 Era?","volume":"717","year_published":2021},{"abstract":"Nanomaterials are at the leading edge of the emerging field of nanotechnology. Their unique and tunable size-dependent properties (in the range 1–100 nm) make these materials indispensable in many modern technological applications. In this Review, we summarize the state-of-art in the manufacture and applications of inorganic nanoparticles made using continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis (CHFS) processes. First, we introduce ideal requirements of any flow process for nanoceramics production, outline different approaches to CHFS, and introduce the pertinent properties of supercritical water and issues around mixing in flow, to generate nanoparticles. This Review then gives comprehensive coverage of the current application space for CHFS-made nanomaterials including optical, healthcare, electronics (including sensors, information, and communication technologies), catalysis, devices (including energy harvesting/conversion/fuels), and energy storage applications. Thereafter, topics of precursor chemistry and

In this article, we look for information about the education system in two different countries, namely Japan and Indonesia. The purpose of this research is to find out the integration between the two countries that have different education management systems. The research method used is a descriptive qualitative method. In this research also, the research method is based on the philosophy of postpositivism, using natural conditions or objects. The instrument used to find out information on the education system in each school uses 10 questions and looks for curriculum information data in general in each country. The findings in this study found that, although the management of the education systems of the two countries was slightly different, Indonesian students could compete to continue their tertiary education to developed countries. Besides, the education system in Japan does not make students from Indonesia experience difficulties.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Institut Agama Islam Negeri Kediri"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Munifah","initials":"M","last_name":"Munifah"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Institut Agama Islam Negeri Kediri"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Iskandar","initials":"I","last_name":"Tsani"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Institut Agama Islam Negeri Kediri"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Muhamad","initials":"M","last_name":"Yasin"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Istanbul Esenyurt University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Hasan Said","initials":"HS","last_name":"Tortop"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"ID"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"21881038"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.440754.6"},{"type":"ror","value":"05smgpd89"}],"name":"Bogor Agricultural University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Endah Kinarya","initials":"EK","last_name":"Palupi"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"JP"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"206011266"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.258777.8"},{"type":"ror","value":"02qf2tx24"}],"name":"Kwansei Gakuin University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Rofiqul","initials":"R","last_name":"Umam"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2019-12-26T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"170","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Higher education"},{"name":"Sociology"},{"name":"Management system"},{"name":"Similarity (psychology)"},{"name":"Indonesian"},{"name":"Postpositivism (international relations)"},{"name":"Public relations"},{"name":"Islam"},{"name":"Curriculum"},{"name":"Systems management"}],"funding":[],"issue":"2","keywords":[],"lens_id":"026-648-209-130-769","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[],"scholarly_citations_count":5,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"25797964"},{"type":"print","value":"23017562"}],"publisher":"Raden Intan State Islamic University of Lampung","title_full":"Tadris: Jurnal Keguruan dan Ilmu Tarbiyah"},"source_urls":[{"type":"html","url":"http://repository.iainkediri.ac.id/135/"},{"type":"html","url":"http://ejournal.radenintan.ac.id/index.php/tadris/article/view/4893"},{"type":"pdf","url":"http://ejournal.radenintan.ac.id/index.php/tadris/article/download/4893/pdf"},{"type":"html","url":"https://doaj.org/article/6e7baf655d0d455b9ecd65304146b0b4"},{"type":"core_fulltext","url":"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/276126931.pdf"}],"start_page":"159","title":"Management System of Education: Conceptual Similarity (Integration) between Japanese Learning System and Islamic Learning System in Indonesia","volume":"4","year_published":2019},{"abstract":"Advanced manufacturing solutions, augmented reality, and cloud and big data are technologies pertaining to Industry 4.0. These technologies improve working conditions, create new business models, and increase both productivity and firm quality production. However, they can also improve life and society as a whole. This new perspective, oriented toward social and global well-being, is called Society 5.0. As has happened for all past industrial revolutions, Industry 4.0 will support the transition to a different society, i.e., Society 5.0. In this transition, open innovation and value co-creation can play an important role. The aim of the study was twofold: to examine how Industry 4.0 features and enabling technologies can support the transition to Society 5.0 and to investigate the roles of both open innovation and value co-creation within this transition. A conceptual framework was developed to jointly consider for the first time Industry 4.0, Society 5.0, open innovation, and value co-creation, which are all challenging issues that firms must cope with nowadays. Managers could profit from these insights to design ad hoc strategies in order to benefit from the opportunities emerging from this transition and overcome the main related challenges.","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Barbara","initials":"B","last_name":"Aquilani"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Michela","initials":"M","last_name":"Piccarozzi"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Tindara","initials":"T","last_name":"Abbate"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Anna Paola","initials":"AP","last_name":"Codini"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2020-10-28T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":null,"fields_of_study":[{"name":"Conceptual framework"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Open innovation"},{"name":"Profit (economics)"},{"name":"Industry 4.0"},{"name":"Co-creation"},{"name":"Industrial organization"},{"name":"Business model"},{"name":"Big data"},{"name":"Advanced manufacturing"}],"funding":[],"issue":"21","keywords":[],"lens_id":"027-194-470-119-742","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"001-176-949-317-166"},{"lens_id":"001-937-465-603-426"},{"lens_id":"002-311-018-495-154"},{"lens_id":"002-411-915-669-968"},{"lens_id":"005-220-873-251-762"},{"lens_id":"006-675-752-138-373"},{"lens_id":"007-574-624-257-144"},{"lens_id":"008-302-910-246-857"},{"lens_id":"013-531-466-197-883"},{"lens_id":"015-447-374-583-278"},{"lens_id":"016-303-567-431-004"},{"lens_id":"016-774-596-734-830"},{"lens_id":"019-763-285-018-963"},{"lens_id":"020-969-308-135-679"},{"lens_id":"021-588-736-673-286"},{"lens_id":"023-935-252-395-394"},{"lens_id":"024-863-314-645-595"},{"lens_id":"025-445-829-094-029"},{"lens_id":"028-028-892-088-002"},{"lens_id":"029-333-074-857-655"},{"lens_id":"030-424-393-136-862"},{"lens_id":"031-446-952-817-490"},{"lens_id":"034-476-070-261-685"},{"lens_id":"035-231-989-556-279"},{"lens_id":"036-297-026-204-017"},{"lens_id":"036-681-732-980-212"},{"lens_id":"037-594-622-036-731"},{"lens_id":"038-964-429-089-518"},{"lens_id":"040-778-348-220-273"},{"lens_id":"040-789-926-270-357"},{"lens_id":"040-954-000-855-374"},{"lens_id":"042-622-995-382-852"},{"lens_id":"042-997-309-153-234"},{"lens_id":"044-119-959-146-339"},{"lens_id":"046-246-731-976-891"},{"lens_id":"046-382-517-518-693"},{"lens_id":"047-357-116-137-074"},{"lens_id":"052-961-258-603-888"},{"lens_id":"056-990-589-398-610"},{"lens_id":"058-666-003-191-603"},{"lens_id":"062-757-415-379-846"},{"lens_id":"063-135-384-962-122"},{"lens_id":"064-042-765-914-689"},{"lens_id":"064-542-948-840-61X"},{"lens_id":"068-490-188-515-163"},{"lens_id":"072-286-099-287-345"},{"lens_id":"073-325-440-578-871"},{"lens_id":"074-895-567-621-479"},{"lens_id":"076-991-386-599-906"},{"lens_id":"081-288-888-911-476"},{"lens_id":"081-937-750-673-601"},{"lens_id":"082-059-683-653-001"},{"lens_id":"085-300-287-100-525"},{"lens_id":"085-738-769-698-108"},{"lens_id":"087-215-530-709-098"},{"lens_id":"088-244-676-132-622"},{"lens_id":"088-281-655-337-496"},{"lens_id":"089-197-091-271-085"},{"lens_id":"092-147-288-927-925"},{"lens_id":"092-609-497-400-592"},{"lens_id":"093-670-206-119-602"},{"lens_id":"097-603-057-392-60X"},{"lens_id":"099-525-058-823-266"},{"lens_id":"100-124-216-391-558"},{"lens_id":"100-628-835-997-419"},{"lens_id":"102-443-972-671-847"},{"lens_id":"102-838-274-798-046"},{"lens_id":"106-740-230-449-952"},{"lens_id":"107-242-490-062-062"},{"lens_id":"115-847-590-573-793"},{"lens_id":"116-467-819-785-092"},{"lens_id":"117-469-885-123-201"},{"lens_id":"117-484-712-607-828"},{"lens_id":"126-473-723-473-477"},{"lens_id":"126-821-861-406-828"},{"lens_id":"134-477-067-632-705"},{"lens_id":"135-553-141-898-826"},{"lens_id":"137-059-616-282-11X"},{"lens_id":"139-204-566-527-086"},{"lens_id":"140-773-897-108-949"},{"lens_id":"144-670-467-410-017"},{"lens_id":"146-187-024-059-654"},{"lens_id":"149-269-099-266-71X"},{"lens_id":"149-531-816-526-90X"},{"lens_id":"154-889-013-873-278"},{"lens_id":"182-004-071-343-835"}],"scholarly_citations_count":36,"source":{"country":"Switzerland","issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"20711050"}],"publisher":"MDPI AG","title_full":"Sustainability"},"source_urls":[{"type":"html","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/21/8943"},{"type":"unknown","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/21/8943/pdf"},{"type":"html","url":"https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jsusta/v12y2020i21p8943-d435842.html"}],"start_page":"8943","title":"The Role of Open Innovation and Value Co-creation in the Challenging Transition from Industry 4.0 to Society 5.0: Toward a Theoretical Framework","volume":"12","year_published":2020},{"abstract":"<jats:p>Modern development of the noosphere, the emergence of new industries and a qualitative transformation of production and distribution relations are determined by widespread digitalization throughout the world. The main goals of digitalization are the development of innovations focused on the development of society 5.0, ensuring the free flow of data and capital. Considering the Mundell-Fleming model application as the instrument to support economic welfare it should be admitted the “impossible trinity” of the model and the lack of research to solve it. The paper investigates the Mundell-Fleming dilemma solution on the ground of digitalization. The research methodology is based on fundamental tenets of modern economics and general scientific methods, namely: induction, deduction, dialectical method and systematic approach, analysis and synthesis – all of these for analyzing the process of digitalization and to establish the principles, forms and foundations of the Mundell-Fleming model application in the digital dimension, systematization and generalization (to substantiate the phenomenon of digitalization), abstract-logical method (for recent tendencies substantiation), economic-mathematical (to compare and analyze data), institutional-comparative (for the analysis Mundell-Fleming model application in the digital economy). The paper studies the Mundell-Fleming model application in digital economy, it investigates global trends as well as peculiarities of digitalization in Ukrainian economy.

In this research paper, the author intended to define and examine the relationship and impact of construction productivity (CP) over construction project performance (CPP). The author tests the proposition that there is a positive relationship/impact between both of them. And to test the effect of factors is affecting CP on CPP and to propose a conceptual model on the basis of the analysis. To validate the mathematical validity of factor analysis, Spearman correlation analysis has been performed on the factors. And to check the reliability of all the factors using reliability analysis, and finally test the hypothesis that construction productivity is having a positive impact on project performance using one sample t-test. The findings of the study concluded that there is a positive impact of construction productivity on project performance in Indian construction projects.

With Industry 4.0 being unable to address and meet increased drive of personalization, the term Industry 5.0 was coined for addressing personalized manufacturing and empowering humans in manufacturing processes. The onset of the term Industry 5.0 is observed to have various views of how it is defined and what constitutes the reconciliation between humans and machines. This serves as the motivation of this paper in identifying and analyzing the various themes and research trends of what Industry 5.0 is using text mining tools and techniques. Toward this, the abstracts of 196 published papers based on the keyword “Industry 5.0” search in IEEE, science direct and MDPI data bases were extracted. Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed for further analysis to apply text mining techniques of key terms extraction and frequency analysis. Further topic mining i.e., unsupervised machine learning method was used for exploring the data. It is observed that the terms artificial intelligence (AI), big data, supply chain, digital transformation, machine learning, internet of things (IoT), are among the most often used and among several enablers that have been identified by researchers to drive Industry 5.0. Five major themes of Industry 5.0 addressing, supply chain evaluation and optimization, enterprise innovation and digitization, smart and sustainable manufacturing, transformation driven by IoT, AI, and Big Data, and Human-machine connectivity were classified among the published literature, highlighting the research themes that can be further explored. It is observed that the theme of Industry 5.0 as a gateway towards human machine connectivity and co-existence is gaining more interest among the research community in the recent years.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"US"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I4210116219"},{"type":"ror","value":"02qg60849"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.459513.f"}],"name":"Engineering

Japan's Society 5.0 needs to be discussed because the global aspect of Japan's Society 5.0, namely the spread via the internet and Google, has not been researched widely. Even though, the Government of Japan committed as a role model for the world with Society 5.0 . The method used in this article is a case study with data from Google Trends. The concept used is the globalization from Thomas Friedman. The results of this article show that the topic of Japan's Society 5.0 has attracted foreign public attention in several countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, India, and the United States. Then, the public in these countries also used Google to find out topics related to Japan's Society 5.0. For example, the topics of society, industry, the industrial revolution, and Industry 4.0. The spread of Japan's Society 5.0 topic in various countries can be stated in line with Thomas Friedman's argumentation on globalization which is centered on Information and Communications Technology (ICT) development. Artikel ini berupaya untuk mendeskripsikan penyebaran topik Society 5.0 Jepang di luar Jepang berdasarkan hasil pencarian Google pada tahun 2019. Society 5.0 Jepang perlu untuk dibahas karena aspek global dari Society 5.0 Jepang yaitu penyebaran melalui internet dan Google belum terlalu dikaji secara luas. Padahal, Pemerintah Jepang memiliki komitmen untuk menjadi percontohan bagi dunia dengan Society 5.0 . Metode yang digunakan dalam artikel ini adalah studi kasus dengan data dari Google Trends. Konsep yang digunakan adalah globalisasi dari Thomas Friedman. Hasil artikel ini memperlihatkan topik Society 5.0 Jepang menjadi perhatian publik asing di beberapa negara seperti Indonesia, Malaysia, India, dan Amerika Serikat. Lalu, publik di negara-negara tersebut juga menggunakan Google untuk mencari tahu topik yang terkait dengan Society 5.0 Jepang. Contohnya adalah topik masyarakat, industri, revolusi industri, dan Industry 4.0 . Penyebaran topik Society 5.0 Jepang di berbagai negara dapat dinyatakan sejalan dengan argumentasi globalisasi dari Thomas Friedman yang berpusat pada perkembangan Teknologi Informasi dan Komunikasi (TIK).","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"ID"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"29617571"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.9581.5"},{"type":"ror","value":"0116zj450"}],"name":"University of Indonesia"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Muhammad Fikry","initials":"MF","last_name":"Anshori"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2020-05-30T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"82","fields_of_study":[],"funding":[],"issue":"1","keywords":[],"lens_id":"029-449-130-309-798","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"23559500"},{"type":"print","value":"23018208"}],"publisher":"Universitas Andalas","title_full":"Andalas Journal of International Studies (AJIS)"},"source_urls":[{"type":"pdf","url":"http://ajis.fisip.unand.ac.id/index.php/ajis/article/download/307/139"},{"type":"html","url":"http://ajis.fisip.unand.ac.id/index.php/ajis/article/view/307"},{"type":"core_fulltext","url":"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/327261186.pdf"}],"start_page":"61","title":"Globalisasi Society 5.0 Jepang: Studi Kasus Hasil Pencarian Google di Luar Jepang Tahun 2019","volume":"9","year_published":2020},{"abstract":"<jats:p>The article examines the foundations of educational innovations in the Krestovozdvszhensk Labor Brotherhood, which was founded by the famous philosopher, landowner and philanthropist N. N. Neplyuev in the 1880s, 30 km to North of Glukhov. It shows the socio-economic successes that the community could achieve in the production and social spheres. Educational innovations, due to which young brothers were brought up, are characterized: the need for constant practical application of innovative technologies and methods of work, reproduction of motives for self-learning and obtaining new knowledge, conditionality of constant decision-making, self-organization and self-government, etc. Methods of organization, social relations, approach to production activities along which the Brotherhood lived, days with the present. In particular, the focus of the Brotherhood's economy on the use of renewable resources and ensuring the sustainable state of adjacent ecosystems brings it closer to the goals and objectives of the Third Industrial Revolution, which is now taking place in the world. The priority of information production in the Brotherhood and its focus on the mechanization of labor processes make it clearer the logics of the modern Fourth Industrial Revolution clearer. And, finally, the invaluable achievement of the brothers is the priority they have achieved of a human personality development. This is what is now becoming essential in the light of the Fifth Industrial Revolution. It is especially noted that the Brotherhood, thanks to its educational system, managed to create a unique reproductive potential, which included: a system of necessary self-reproduction of human personalities; system of reproduction of the most effective use and reproduction of natural capital; system of reproduction of synergetic combination of human, natural and physical capitals.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"UA"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"25822123"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.446019.e"},{"type":"ror","value":"01w60n236"}],"name":"Sumy State University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Leonid Hr.","initials":"LH","last_name":"Melnyk"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"UA"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"166349642"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.446020.4"},{"type":"ror","value":"00vnaf984"}],"name":"Sumy National Agrarian University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Anzhelika O.","initials":"AO","last_name":"Shevel"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"UA"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"25822123"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.446019.e"},{"type":"ror","value":"01w60n236"}],"name":"Sumy State University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Iryna A.","initials":"IA","last_name":"Panchenko"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"UA"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"25822123"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.446019.e"},{"type":"ror","value":"01w60n236"}],"name":"Sumy State University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Yevhen O.","initials":"YO","last_name":"Skrypka"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"UA"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"166349642"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.446020.4"},{"type":"ror","value":"00vnaf984"}],"name":"Sumy National Agrarian University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Tetiana S.","initials":"TS","last_name":"Sierik"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":null},"end_page":"116","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Political science"},{"name":"Economic growth"}],"funding":[],"issue":"3","keywords":[],"lens_id":"029-774-883-923-265","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"000-000-000-000-001"},{"lens_id":"000-000-000-000-001"},{"lens_id":"000-000-000-000-001"},{"lens_id":"000-000-000-000-001"},{"lens_id":"000-000-000-000-001"},{"lens_id":"000-000-000-000-001"},{"lens_id":"000-000-000-000-001"},{"lens_id":"000-000-000-000-001"},{"lens_id":"000-000-000-000-001"},{"lens_id":"000-000-000-000-001"},{"lens_id":"000-000-000-000-001"},{"lens_id":"000-000-000-000-001"},{"lens_id":"000-000-000-000-001"},{"lens_id":"000-000-000-000-001"},{"lens_id":"000-000-000-000-001"},{"lens_id":"000-000-000-000-001"},{"lens_id":"000-000-000-000-001"},{"lens_id":"000-000-000-000-001"},{"lens_id":"000-000-000-000-001"},{"lens_id":"000-000-000-000-001"},{"lens_id":"000-000-000-000-001"},{"lens_id":"000-000-000-000-001"},{"lens_id":"000-000-000-000-001"},{"lens_id":"000-000-000-000-001"},{"lens_id":"000-000-000-000-001"}],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"print","value":"17268699"}],"publisher":"Publishing House Helvetica (Publications)","title_full":"Mechanism of an Economic Regulation"},"source_urls":[{"type":"unknown","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.21272/mer.2020.89.08"}],"start_page":"98","title":"Socio-Economic Management in Neplyuev’s Brotherhood: Education Ahead of Time","volume":null,"year_published":2020},{"abstract":"<jats:p>The 5<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> International Conference on Eco Engineering Development (ICEED 2021) brings academicians, practicians, and governmental policy makers to discuss the emerging topic of “Innovative Eco Engineering for Sustainable Development towards Society 5.0”.

However, a survey on 64 studies shows a wide variation of the correlation between customer satisfaction and financial performance. The correlation coefficients are varied from -0.256 to 0.899. This study applies a meta-analysis on those 64 studies’ findings to find the true correlation between customer satisfaction and financial performance. The analysis clusters the 64 studies based on year of research, business category observed, and geographical area of research. The result shows that the correlation between customer satisfaction and financial performance is relatively high (0.525) before 1990, becomes confusing (not-significantly correlated) in 1991-2000, increases (0.626) in 2001-2010, and decreases (0.595) after 2011.

The two variables are significantly correlated according to the studies conducted in Europe region (0.566) and Asia-Africa (0.657), but could not to be proven significantly correlated in USA region. The insights from the meta-analysis findings are: (1) the customer satisfaction role is change by time as well as the changes of industry environment, so that research on customer satisfaction will always be beneficial; (2) in individualist society like USA, further researches on customer behavior and culture are required to find more clear explanation about the role of customer satisfaction as well as other financial success factors, on the company performance. </jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"ID"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"165230279"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.8570.a"},{"type":"ror","value":"03ke6d638"}],"name":"Gadjah Mada University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Yosephine","initials":"Y","last_name":"Suharyanti"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"D.M.R.T.","initials":"DMRT","last_name":"Dewa"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2019-06-30T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"48","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Marketing"},{"name":"Customer satisfaction"},{"name":"Lead (geology)"},{"name":"Meta-analysis"}],"funding":[],"issue":"1","keywords":[],"lens_id":"030-441-393-684-273","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"26854090"}],"publisher":"Universitas Atma Jaya Yogyakarta","title_full":"International Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management"},"source_urls":[{"type":"unknown","url":"http://ojs.uajy.ac.id/index.php/IJIEEM/article/viewFile/2295/1397"},{"type":"core_fulltext","url":"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/229551019.pdf"}],"start_page":"37","title":"Does Customer Satisfaction Really Lead Company to Financial Success?

In this respect, the implementation of the circular economy model, which requires engineers to acquire appropriate competencies, enabling companies to establish this model at the manufacturing level. Moreover, competence has always been a priority for both the professional and the company. In this sense, connectivism has been called a learning theory for the digital era; this is the reason why a review of the state-of-the-art developments of this paradigm focused on engineering has been carried out. In this sense, the potential of the digital transformation in instruction to formulate an engineering model based on neuro-competences is of great interest, taking the connectivist paradigm as a methodological axis. To this end, a first bibliometric analysis has been carried out to identify the drivers on which to base the design of the neuro-competencies of the instructional engineering environment and the trend towards curriculum development under dual training models. The bibliographical research carried out on the connectivist paradigm has served to identify the trends followed to date in education within the subject area of engineering. These trends have not fully taken into account the leading role of the human factor within the socio-technical cyber-physical systems of sustainable manufacturing (SCSSM). The focus was more on the technology than on the adaptation of the uniqueness of the human factor and the tasks entrusted to him, which entails an additional complexity that needs to be addressed in both academic and professional contexts. In light of the foregoing, an improvement to the acquisition and management of competencies has been proposed to the academic, professional and dual engineering contexts. It is based on the transversal inclusion of the concept of neuro-competence applied to the competence engineering (CE) model, transforming it into the neuro-competence engineering (NCE) model. The foregoing provides a better match between the characteristics of the human factor and the uniqueness of the tasks performed by the engineer, incorporating activity theory (AT), the law of variety required (LVR), the connectivist paradigm and neuroscience as a transversal driver of innovation through fractality. This proposal enables a ubiquitous and sustainable learning model throughout the entire academic and professional life cycle of the engineer, placing it sustainably at the heart of the instructional and professional cyber-physical socio-technical system, thus complying with the SDGs set by the UN and Horizon 2030.","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Susana Suarez-Fernandez","initials":"SS","last_name":"de Miranda"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Francisco","initials":"F","last_name":"Aguayo-González"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"María Jesús","initials":"MJ","last_name":"Ávila-Gutiérrez"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Antonio","initials":"A","last_name":"Córdoba-Roldán"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2021-04-15T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":null,"fields_of_study":[{"name":"Competence (human resources)"},{"name":"Engineering management"},{"name":"Digital transformation"},{"name":"Variety (cybernetics)"},{"name":"Sustainable engineering"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Sustainable development"},{"name":"Adaptation (computer science)"},{"name":"Connectivism"},{"name":"Learning theory"}],"funding":[],"issue":"8","keywords":[],"lens_id":"031-540-666-653-73X","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"000-248-934-782-51X"},{"lens_id":"000-257-060-937-828"},{"lens_id":"002-052-422-936-00X"},{"lens_id":"002-764-082-187-051"},{"lens_id":"003-190-318-217-736"},{"lens_id":"007-066-362-009-544"},{"lens_id":"010-188-454-033-318"},{"lens_id":"011-560-980-705-529"},{"lens_id":"011-803-200-068-324"},{"lens_id":"012-504-862-865-628"},{"lens_id":"016-281-638-643-238"},{"lens_id":"016-309-090-086-107"},{"lens_id":"017-557-569-036-776"},{"lens_id":"018-643-065-555-350"},{"lens_id":"019-114-632-117-748"},{"lens_id":"020-249-263-884-768"},{"lens_id":"021-013-375-151-716"},{"lens_id":"021-269-212-641-621"},{"lens_id":"023-211-964-243-520"},{"lens_id":"025-288-994-858-057"},{"lens_id":"027-228-321-743-026"},{"lens_id":"029-534-629-933-801"},{"lens_id":"030-447-833-209-52X"},{"lens_id":"030-997-397-302-643"},{"lens_id":"032-252-814-985-358"},{"lens_id":"033-739-242-312-502"},{"lens_id":"041-064-879-430-933"},{"lens_id":"042-271-946-455-320"},{"lens_id":"043-368-123-643-192"},{"lens_id":"046-934-025-340-190"},{"lens_id":"051-769-551-477-060"},{"lens_id":"052-453-807-944-116"},{"lens_id":"053-526-343-911-279"},{"lens_id":"053-530-162-809-509"},{"lens_id":"056-490-188-922-097"},{"lens_id":"057-021-476-215-834"},{"lens_id":"057-888-766-237-54X"},{"lens_id":"058-082-551-642-71X"},{"lens_id":"058-485-225-720-635"},{"lens_id":"061-472-007-804-49X"},{"lens_id":"061-508-236-488-840"},{"lens_id":"065-103-750-376-489"},{"lens_id":"065-578-638-556-075"},{"lens_id":"069-211-190-470-592"},{"lens_id":"070-176-205-149-166"},{"lens_id":"070-580-919-519-258"},{"lens_id":"072-175-378-404-493"},{"lens_id":"073-227-605-513-031"},{"lens_id":"074-525-653-012-188"},{"lens_id":"077-068-317-696-523"},{"lens_id":"080-599-783-436-156"},{"lens_id":"089-758-833-541-839"},{"lens_id":"092-955-685-410-706"},{"lens_id":"095-834-465-737-393"},{"lens_id":"098-622-889-694-985"},{"lens_id":"107-267-433-837-301"},{"lens_id":"110-309-926-544-567"},{"lens_id":"113-724-467-093-61X"},{"lens_id":"116-278-715-717-914"},{"lens_id":"117-796-521-512-888"},{"lens_id":"119-730-544-716-817"},{"lens_id":"119-925-985-130-432"},{"lens_id":"126-660-588-062-133"},{"lens_id":"130-123-548-819-526"},{"lens_id":"136-967-015-884-024"},{"lens_id":"138-143-336-920-066"},{"lens_id":"138-529-852-670-835"},{"lens_id":"139-628-237-366-583"},{"lens_id":"139-649-663-651-283"},{"lens_id":"140-017-694-094-643"},{"lens_id":"145-594-768-943-946"},{"lens_id":"149-893-976-597-748"},{"lens_id":"151-067-699-992-99X"},{"lens_id":"151-658-446-530-089"},{"lens_id":"152-662-394-943-92X"},{"lens_id":"164-678-142-538-444"},{"lens_id":"168-776-736-332-587"}],"scholarly_citations_count":3,"source":{"country":"Switzerland","issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"20711050"}],"publisher":"MDPI AG","title_full":"Sustainability"},"source_urls":[{"type":"html","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/8/4389"},{"type":"html","url":"https://idus.us.es/handle/11441/107944"},{"type":"pdf","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/8/4389/pdf"}],"start_page":"4389","title":"Neuro-Competence Approach for Sustainable Engineering","volume":"13","year_published":2021},{"abstract":"Technology acceptance model (TAM) is arguably the most widely used intention theory that explains the individual’s acceptance of a certain technology.  Since Davis introduced TAM in 1986, it has been applied and validated in a variety of disciplines, including educational sciences. However, scholars note that depending on a specific context, the original TAM needs to be extended, which has been done by introducing external variables and other theories. Despite the existent TAM2 and TAM3, numerous scholars still opt for the original TAM, extending it with the variables and theories that are relevant to the specific context of their study. The aim of the present paper is to provide an overview of validated TAM extensions, which might later help to further the understanding of educational technology acceptance, which is a prerequisite of its adoption. Since interdisciplinarity in various contexts is becoming more and more common, the overview presents TAM extensions that come from a number of different disciplines. The overview is based on 108 papers that were retrieved from the Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics) by searching for the keywords ‘extended Technology Acceptance Model’, ‘extended TAM’, and ‘TAM extension’.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"LT"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"172574986"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.6901.e"},{"type":"ror","value":"01me6gb93"}],"name":"Kaunas University of Technology"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Vilma","initials":"V","last_name":"Sukackė"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2019-05-21T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"549","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Variety (cybernetics)"},{"name":"Educational technology"},{"name":"Technology acceptance model"},{"name":"Context (language use)"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"External variable"},{"name":"Knowledge management"},{"name":"Analytics"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"031-853-706-569-696","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"000-060-417-634-426"},{"lens_id":"000-192-241-807-657"},{"lens_id":"001-896-044-157-028"},{"lens_id":"002-009-009-314-502"},{"lens_id":"002-524-455-455-15X"},{"lens_id":"002-738-315-542-28X"},{"lens_id":"003-084-551-080-976"},{"lens_id":"003-461-282-889-670"},{"lens_id":"004-087-642-395-666"},{"lens_id":"005-114-489-891-90X"},{"lens_id":"006-743-551-051-96X"},{"lens_id":"008-886-823-294-879"},{"lens_id":"010-345-302-201-833"},{"lens_id":"011-254-643-589-955"},{"lens_id":"012-324-673-515-380"},{"lens_id":"012-713-901-916-696"},{"lens_id":"012-736-223-459-933"},{"lens_id":"013-438-143-646-641"},{"lens_id":"014-337-672-859-478"},{"lens_id":"014-945-938-187-795"},{"lens_id":"016-006-036-762-399"},{"lens_id":"024-931-263-968-838"},{"lens_id":"027-772-352-481-03X"},{"lens_id":"029-104-798-516-814"},{"lens_id":"031-350-654-437-485"},{"lens_id":"031-446-952-817-490"},{"lens_id":"031-488-990-263-674"},{"lens_id":"032-216-176-656-243"},{"lens_id":"032-946-419-602-253"},{"lens_id":"033-665-693-191-608"},{"lens_id":"034-957-011-165-180"},{"lens_id":"035-738-341-937-370"},{"lens_id":"038-911-250-952-554"},{"lens_id":"039-266-603-533-644"},{"lens_id":"039-719-033-455-961"},{"lens_id":"041-346-896-921-799"},{"lens_id":"042-194-475-698-783"},{"lens_id":"044-244-831-012-940"},{"lens_id":"044-531-016-882-263"},{"lens_id":"045-238-259-927-490"},{"lens_id":"046-011-306-766-328"},{"lens_id":"046-608-623-604-981"},{"lens_id":"047-105-400-407-261"},{"lens_id":"050-158-145-908-92X"},{"lens_id":"051-121-185-513-380"},{"lens_id":"051-358-632-280-01X"},{"lens_id":"055-410-359-369-400"},{"lens_id":"058-081-424-637-980"},{"lens_id":"058-201-676-676-656"},{"lens_id":"058-291-772-009-919"},{"lens_id":"060-286-799-044-365"},{"lens_id":"061-259-165-674-448"},{"lens_id":"061-773-356-664-789"},{"lens_id":"063-014-737-157-460"},{"lens_id":"065-195-970-958-916"},{"lens_id":"065-761-785-191-85X"},{"lens_id":"067-624-070-521-861"},{"lens_id":"067-963-675-792-046"},{"lens_id":"069-629-164-625-835"},{"lens_id":"070-109-513-692-451"},{"lens_id":"070-228-166-005-742"},{"lens_id":"070-892-410-747-445"},{"lens_id":"071-323-768-093-526"},{"lens_id":"072-654-117-180-055"},{"lens_id":"074-985-907-567-667"},{"lens_id":"075-533-093-091-514"},{"lens_id":"078-772-545-287-938"},{"lens_id":"078-835-256-720-171"},{"lens_id":"080-768-432-037-596"},{"lens_id":"083-026-769-368-91X"},{"lens_id":"085-162-169-894-691"},{"lens_id":"086-754-909-661-136"},{"lens_id":"093-474-817-290-531"},{"lens_id":"098-109-450-765-030"},{"lens_id":"099-287-847-734-118"},{"lens_id":"105-083-572-143-597"},{"lens_id":"108-194-471-442-679"},{"lens_id":"111-967-642-990-937"},{"lens_id":"112-966-943-064-437"},{"lens_id":"114-123-671-516-221"},{"lens_id":"114-556-841-480-844"},{"lens_id":"116-196-815-757-148"},{"lens_id":"116-654-675-004-149"},{"lens_id":"117-817-762-502-656"},{"lens_id":"118-103-312-124-303"},{"lens_id":"119-401-692-120-989"},{"lens_id":"122-589-788-943-520"},{"lens_id":"122-781-429-944-652"},{"lens_id":"135-167-153-922-058"},{"lens_id":"143-875-130-007-110"},{"lens_id":"144-449-085-891-625"},{"lens_id":"144-490-339-181-872"},{"lens_id":"151-720-506-951-323"},{"lens_id":"156-878-325-309-19X"},{"lens_id":"159-374-486-295-921"},{"lens_id":"160-963-018-696-67X"},{"lens_id":"163-637-734-144-951"},{"lens_id":"175-558-529-260-056"},{"lens_id":"176-351-246-035-770"},{"lens_id":"184-086-986-348-962"},{"lens_id":"190-680-485-510-350"},{"lens_id":"199-489-396-833-723"}],"scholarly_citations_count":1,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"22560629"},{"type":"print","value":"16915887"}],"publisher":"Rezekne Academy of Technologies","title_full":"SOCIETY.

The different appearance and activities during the day and night will provide a different spatial experience in terms of the identity of the city. Bandung, as one of the cities in Indonesia, has several places that deliver a strong identity, one of which is Jalan Asia Africa, which has significant historical value to create the identity of Bandung. This study was conducted to identify and review the identity of the Asia Africa corridor at night, using the theory of lighting scheme from the elements that build its corridor. As result, the identity of Asia Africa corridor as a public space with strong historical value is supported by its warm color temperature, heightened position of the light source, repetitive density, and the up-lighting. This study can be used as a reference for future lighting design improvements.","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"R.H.W.","initials":"R","last_name":"Abdulhadi"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"T.M.","initials":"T","last_name":"Raja"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"M.","initials":"M","last_name":"Akkaya"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-08-25T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"103","fields_of_study":[],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"035-031-036-146-901","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"book chapter","references":[],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[],"publisher":"Routledge","title_full":"Embracing the Future: Creative Industries for Environment and Advanced Society 5.0 in a Post-Pandemic Era"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"99","title":"Lighting schemes at Asia Africa street corridor as part of city identity","volume":null,"year_published":2022},{"abstract":"<jats:p>Industry 4.0 buzzed out with a theme of “Smart\nManufacturing for the Future”.

Today the need of expansion in businesses directly leads to adoption of new concepts of manufacturing and also making awareness of those used processes to ultimate consumers is needed. Industry 4.0 is related to the processes with latest technologies such as clean-green energy, automation, internet of things (IoT) and digitization, whereas, green manufacturing is almost similar like use of fewer natural resources, reduction in pollution &amp; waste, reducing carbon footprints, recycle &amp; reuse of material and moderate emission in processes. Country’s sustainable growth right now is major among other strategies and every country is trying and working hard to incorporate the development process through adoption of these types of tools &amp; techniques. Industry 4.0 technologies and green manufacturing relate to “Green Dialogue” and to some extent proving the object also. Now, introduction of Industry 5.0 is welcoming fully fledged automation of industries with green processes like G-IoT. However, climate health, consumers health and production &amp; operation health is on priority to have healthier green clean sustainable development in the world. From the above title, the purpose of this study is to present the potential of the industries\nunder new industrial revolution with the combination to eco-friendly manufacturing leading to knowledge of the updated technologies used for their respective ecological production &amp; operation management. These concepts are considered to be new around the world and most of the developed countries are more active in accepting these\nsustainable concepts in their operations and production in industries. Developing countries like India are way behind in acquiring these concepts as manufacturing is aware but not willing to pay extra cost of production in advancing the operation &amp; production process.

The fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0, has been gaining momentum since 2015, being a significant driver for sustainable development and a successful catalyst to tackle critical global challenges. This review paper summarizes the most relevant food Industry 4.0 technologies including, among others, digital technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, big data analytics, Internet of Things, and blockchain) and other technological advances (e.g., smart sensors, robotics, digital twins, and cyber-physical systems). Moreover, insights into the new food trends (such as 3D printed foods) that have emerged as a result of the Industry 4.0 technological revolution will also be discussed in Part II of this work. The Industry 4.0 technologies have significantly modified the food industry and led to substantial consequences for the environment, economics, and human health. Despite the importance of each of the technologies mentioned above, ground-breaking sustainable solutions could only emerge by combining many technologies simultaneously. The Food Industry 4.0 era has been characterized by new challenges, opportunities, and trends that have reshaped current strategies and prospects for food production and consumption patterns, paving the way for the move toward Industry 5.0.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Sustainable AgriFoodtech Innovation & Research (SAFIR), Arras,

as industry 4.0 evolves in increasingly digitalized production. This development entails that job transformations and future skills need attention from the perspective of industry 5.0, where human and machine find ways of working together to improve production performance. Facing this perspective, one challenge is a growing need for novel lifelong learning initiatives, to meet emerging and altering occupations for the fulfilment of future skill requirements. This challenge is addressed here by portraying a case where three Swedish universities have formed a distinctive collaboration to develop a flexible (i.e. blended) course for professionals, in the subject of Digitally-enabled production. The purpose is to develop a sustainable collaboration between the universities and create a course format on master level addressing lifelong learning for the increasingly digitalized production. The ambition is to increase the impact of the universities respective efforts by sharing resources and utilizing individual specialized expertise to develop a practical and relevant course that can reach a larger target group. The course encompasses industry 4.0 readiness on three levels of production systems; plant-, production cell-, and component level; to adopt a holistic view of digitalization in production. We followed an action research approach for continuously collecting and documenting our experiences during the course development, implementation, and dissemination of the course. Within the frame of action research, an explorative case study describes and analyzes the initiative. The results highlight challenges and opportunities for succeeding with this form of co-produced course. The joint course gives professionals possibilities to work on cases from their own companies with expert supervision from three manufacturing levels to address complex challenges in industry 4.0 implementation. To conclude, the importance of lifelong learning in relation to the human-centric approach of industry 5.0 is emphasized as a future direction.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"University West, Trollhättan, Sweden"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Kristina","initials":"K","last_name":"Eriksson"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Mälardalen University, Eskilstuna, Sweden"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Koteshwar","initials":"K","last_name":"Chirumalla"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Mälardalen University, Eskilstuna, Sweden"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Paulina","initials":"P","last_name":"Myrelid"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"University West, Trollhättan, Sweden"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Mikael","initials":"M","last_name":"Ericsson"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Mälardalen University, Eskilstuna, Sweden"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Anna","initials":"A","last_name":"Granlund"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Linnaeus University, Växjö, Sweden"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Lars","initials":"L","last_name":"Håkansson"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"University West, Trollhättan, Sweden"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Dahniel","initials":"D","last_name":"Johansson"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-04-20T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":null,"fields_of_study":[{"name":"Lifelong learning"},{"name":"Production (economics)"},{"name":"Knowledge management"},{"name":"Engineering"},{"name":"Perspective (graphical)"},{"name":"Action (physics)"},{"name":"Engineering ethics"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Engineering management"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"037-734-128-213-829","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"book chapter","references":[],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"unknown","value":"2352751x"},{"type":"unknown","value":"23527528"}],"publisher":"IOS Press","title_full":"Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":null,"title":"Experiences in Running a Professional Course on Digitally-Enabled Production in Collaboration Between Three Swedish Universities","volume":null,"year_published":2022},{"abstract":"This research is motivated dissatisfaction of teachers and students on learning media in school.

In this context, which is characterized by a large gap between training and operative processes, a dedicated method is required to manage and extract the massive amount of data and the related information mining. The method presented in this work aims to reduce this gap with near-zero-failure advanced diagnostics (AD) for smart management, which is exploitable in any context of Society 5.0, thus reducing the risk factors at all management levels and ensuring quality and sustainability. We have also developed innovative applications for a human-centered management system to support scheduling in the maintenance of operative processes, for reducing training costs, for improving production yield, and for creating a human–machine cyberspace for smart infrastructure design. The results obtained in 12 international companies demonstrate a possible global standardization of operative processes, leading to the design of a near-zero-failure intelligent system that is able to learn and upgrade itself. Our new method provides guidance for selecting the new generation of intelligent manufacturing and smart systems in order to optimize human–machine interactions, with the related smart maintenance and education.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"IT"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"124601658"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.10383.39"},{"type":"ror","value":"02k7wn190"}],"name":"University

Its drivers – advanced digital production technologies – are transforming the entire industrial and spatial landscape. Industrial regions take a special role in these transformations. The research aims to identify trends in the development of basic industries in industrial regions and work out a method to form their new technological image. Methodologically, the study relies on the institutional theory, theories of sustainable and longterm technical and economic development; applies methods of comparative, statistical, structural analysis and neural network modelling. Considering the case of the Ural metal industries, the study reveals the main trends of development and possibilities of forming the image of future of the basic industries of Russia’s industrial regions, as well as specifies the factors that modify these trends under the New Normal. Due to institutional and technological transformations, the Russian metal industries have achieved impregnable positions in the world market. The paper substantiates the changes in the development of the basic industries linked with the formation of Industry 5.0 as the new management paradigm, which assigns priority to the ESG factors. The research demonstrates that an indispensable condition for the successful functioning of companies is the ability to cooperate and agree on decisions. The findings confirm that modernised metal and other basic industries through integrating green, digital and behavioural economy will not only maintain, but are likely to increase their importance in the economy of industrial regions.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Institute of Economics (Ural branch of RAS), Ekaterinburg, Russia"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Olga A.","initials":"OA","last_name":"Romanova"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Institute of Economics (Ural branch of RAS), Ekaterinburg, Russia"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Dmitry V.","initials":"DV","last_name":"Sirotin"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-07-08T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"28","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Industrialisation"},{"name":"Industrial organization"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Sustainable development"},{"name":"Economic system"},{"name":"Regional science"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Economic geography"}],"funding":[],"issue":"2","keywords":[],"lens_id":"040-763-731-698-77X","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"003-682-809-618-463"},{"lens_id":"019-218-091-890-573"},{"lens_id":"020-191-419-063-87X"},{"lens_id":"028-638-803-907-298"},{"lens_id":"032-789-188-529-821"},{"lens_id":"035-253-870-973-574"},{"lens_id":"042-293-327-072-344"},{"lens_id":"049-630-935-658-823"},{"lens_id":"052-162-157-249-567"},{"lens_id":"053-211-367-558-338"},{"lens_id":"060-295-480-322-014"},{"lens_id":"063-891-616-996-756"},{"lens_id":"069-166-891-026-427"},{"lens_id":"071-596-620-879-761"},{"lens_id":"079-284-096-761-588"},{"lens_id":"082-550-423-767-715"},{"lens_id":"089-975-648-983-935"},{"lens_id":"095-589-362-164-725"},{"lens_id":"101-402-844-565-479"},{"lens_id":"121-580-763-708-56X"},{"lens_id":"130-447-246-822-317"},{"lens_id":"174-934-407-787-976"},{"lens_id":"186-735-012-000-298"}],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"unknown","value":"26585081"},{"type":"unknown","value":"26870002"}],"publisher":"Ural State University of Economics","title_full":"Journal of New Economy"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"9","title":"Basic industries of Russia's industrial regions: The image of the future","volume":"23","year_published":2022},{"abstract":"Digital technologies, autonomous systems, and artificial intelligence are seen as mater-of-course parts of the world today. Japan, as one of the leading countries in technological innovations, is the most advanced in terms of approach to digital society. Japanese society and government have been working on a new concept of life where all the digital technologies will communicate through the internet. Society organised in this way is called Society 5.0 - super Smart society. In Japan, this concept is centred about seventeen sustainable goals (United Nations, 2018). Society 5.0 is a reaction to the fundamental technological revolutionary changes known today as Industry 4.0. Thus, Society 5.0 is the consequence of a technological revolution that will eventually affect not just the production but all parts of today's life as well.The new technologies evoke some fundamental philosophical and existential questions. How can technological advances improve the prosperity and functioning of society? What about the privacy and security of all the users? The present paper compares Japan and the Czech Republic from the perspective of digitalization of society based on three main aspects: government programs supporting digital technologies, number of technically educated experts and investments in science and research.

industrial revolution is the introduction of ICT (mostly IoT) in industry and elsewhere, which enables the creation of cyber-physical systems, i.e., digital twins of reality. The application of widespread digitization of processes brings changes in terms of increased efficiency of processes, increased flexibility of production, and the possibility of realizing prosocial and pro-ecological goals, such as sustainable development, sustainable production and consumption, and reducing the consumption of increasingly expensive energy. Nowadays, the high autonomy of cyber-physical systems and benefits to society are expected by including human factors within the Industry 5.0 concept. Implementing the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies and meeting the expectations of sustainable development also means new challenges for the knowledge and skills of industry employees, mainly engineers implementing modern solutions. Hence, the article’s aim is to identify the critical knowledge and skills of engineers responsible for implementing the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies. The achievements and results presented in the article were obtained based on research conducted among experts from the University of Pennsylvania (USA). The study considers aspects connected to the problems of implementing the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies and identifies the benefits and risks of their implementation for Society 5.0.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"PL"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I46305939"},{"type":"ror","value":"04fzm7v55"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.28048.36"}],"name":"University of Zielona Góra"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Sebastian","initials":"S","last_name":"Saniuk"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"PL"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I119004910"},{"type":"ror","value":"02dyjk442"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.6979.1"}],"name":"Silesian University of Technology"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Sandra","initials":"S","last_name":"Grabowska"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I117684438"}],"name":"Penn State Hazleton"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Wieslaw","initials":"W","last_name":"Grebski"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-04-06T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"2677","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Industrial Revolution"},{"name":"Industry 4.0"},{"name":"Digitization"},{"name":"Flexibility (engineering)"},{"name":"Sustainable development"},{"name":"Autonomy"},{"name":"Context (archaeology)"},{"name":"Cyber-physical system"},{"name":"Digital Revolution"},{"name":"Consumption (sociology)"},{"name":"Emerging technologies"},{"name":"Digital transformation"},{"name":"Knowledge management"},{"name":"Engineering management"},{"name":"Engineering"},{"name":"Business"}],"funding":[{"country":null,"funding_id":null,"org":"Silesian University of Technology"}],"issue":"7","keywords":[],"lens_id":"044-575-064-779-644","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"002-995-208-654-267"},{"lens_id":"003-438-619-894-518"},{"lens_id":"003-506-865-330-699"},{"lens_id":"007-522-330-782-926"},{"lens_id":"014-389-842-801-530"},{"lens_id":"017-415-713-662-955"},{"lens_id":"028-232-581-949-707"},{"lens_id":"029-434-241-679-095"},{"lens_id":"029-601-277-122-69X"},{"lens_id":"037-714-590-616-670"},{"lens_id":"039-246-626-911-312"},{"lens_id":"040-252-352-426-753"},{"lens_id":"049-816-999-056-296"},{"lens_id":"051-719-689-499-873"},{"lens_id":"052-471-621-847-448"},{"lens_id":"052-603-569-095-390"},{"lens_id":"057-670-948-885-722"},{"lens_id":"071-604-492-876-845"},{"lens_id":"074-729-567-731-64X"},{"lens_id":"075-716-513-809-986"},{"lens_id":"078-407-023-029-477"},{"lens_id":"079-725-390-592-069"},{"lens_id":"088-971-215-793-402"},{"lens_id":"096-970-663-200-370"},{"lens_id":"101-547-591-388-116"},{"lens_id":"101-685-555-473-423"},{"lens_id":"102-861-736-374-631"},{"lens_id":"113-767-551-070-365"},{"lens_id":"113-830-545-572-413"},{"lens_id":"115-632-079-206-269"},{"lens_id":"122-389-536-558-056"},{"lens_id":"124-572-686-761-031"},{"lens_id":"124-707-104-600-736"},{"lens_id":"125-665-657-978-409"},{"lens_id":"126-188-390-241-818"},{"lens_id":"127-077-319-662-972"},{"lens_id":"138-332-915-687-580"},{"lens_id":"145-433-392-920-035"},{"lens_id":"152-593-264-986-247"},{"lens_id":"180-555-866-129-160"},{"lens_id":"180-734-182-083-978"},{"lens_id":"195-220-031-879-975"}],"scholarly_citations_count":1,"source":{"country":"Switzerland","issn":[{"type":"print","value":"19961073"}],"publisher":"MDPI AG","title_full":"Energies"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"2677","title":"Knowledge and Skills Development in the Context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution Technologies: Interviews of Experts from Pennsylvania State of the USA","volume":"15","year_published":2022},{"abstract":"Industry 4.0 comprises an optimum mix of speed, flexibility, quality, technology, business efficiency and environmental efficiency which leads to a safer and secured future.

At present, business organization are moving towards Industry 5.0 (internet of thought) and GIG economy where the traditional way of fully relying on full time workers are no longer relevant. The world of work is changing. From organizational view, leap frogging strategy with technological advancement are significant to achieve competitive advantage to ensure the continuity of business. While from worker perspective, having technology driven talent is a must to face new business economy called as GIG economy. In other words, all workers in every industry including logistics should ensure they have technology driven talent in his/her portfolio to remain competitive in the working world. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the applicability of Industry 5.0 such as digitalization and mobile marketing to logistics players; to make them more visible to customer and competitor. Single case study method was adopted to study on the perspective as discussed above more in-depth. Findings from this single case study is transferable as it provides rich explanation and discussion from one of the earliest logistics company in Malaysia, with logistics experience almost five (5) decades in providing logistics services. The qualitative findings pointed out four key areas for LSP improvement. Firstly, all LSPs should go for transition process with their business model to provide them with new revenue - logistics digital business and allow them to be more visible to their customer by fully utilizing the promotion activities online. Secondly, every agreement with customer should be put into contract and it is paperless within system. Thirdly, digital payment is a must to all logistics players to practice in order for them to compete in digital era. Finally, and inevitability, to sustain in the business, logistics may move to become intelligent logistics players with carrying no asset and just focus on negotiating contracts with customers. This term refers to practising logistics players with no assets or less assets centric. In principle, the company does not own asset but able to provide logistics services (for example fleet and warehouses) by aggregating â€œinformation about assetsâ€ from people who do own them by leveraging on data. This article contributes to the logistics study by matching issue on digitalization and GIG economy in logistics sector. More work on future of logistics is needed with large sample across the globe in order to obtain more data to help the logistics players depict themselves in new economy.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"MY"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"4528857"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.440439.e"},{"type":"fundref","value":"501100006376"},{"type":"ror","value":"026wwrx19"}],"name":"University of Kuala Lumpur"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Nor Aida Abdul","initials":"NAA","last_name":"Rahman"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Public Project Execution Unit, Department of the Prime Minister, Putrajaya, Malaysia"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Jailani","initials":"J","last_name":"Muda"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"MY"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"4528857"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.440439.e"},{"type":"fundref","value":"501100006376"},{"type":"ror","value":"026wwrx19"}],"name":"University of Kuala Lumpur"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Mohammad Fakhrulnizam","initials":"MF","last_name":"Mohammad"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"MY"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"930072361"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.444483.b"},{"type":"ror","value":"01c5wha71"}],"name":"Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Fauzi","initials":"F","last_name":"Ahmad"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"MY"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"139322472"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.11875.3a"},{"type":"fundref","value":"501100004595"},{"type":"ror","value":"02rgb2k63"}],"name":"Universiti Sains Malaysia"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Suzari Abdul","initials":"SA","last_name":"Rahim"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"ES"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"60053951"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.157927.f"},{"type":"ror","value":"01460j859"}],"name":"Polytechnic University of Valencia"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Fernando","initials":"F","last_name":"Mayor-Vitoria"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2019-04-15T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"1048","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Supply chain"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Revenue"},{"name":"New economy"},{"name":"Portfolio"},{"name":"Industrial organization"},{"name":"Business model"},{"name":"Competitive advantage"},{"name":"Promotion (rank)"},{"name":"Asset (computer security)"}],"funding":[],"issue":"2","keywords":[],"lens_id":"047-194-527-837-91X","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[],"scholarly_citations_count":5,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"unknown","value":"20507399"}],"publisher":null,"title_full":"International Journal of Supply Chain Management"},"source_urls":[{"type":"pdf","url":"https://ojs.excelingtech.co.uk/index.php/IJSCM/article/download/3085/1597"},{"type":"html","url":"https://ojs.excelingtech.co.uk/index.php/IJSCM/article/view/3085/1597"}],"start_page":"1042","title":"Digitalization and Leap Frogging Strategy Among the Supply Chain Member: Facing GIG Economy and Why Should Logistics Players Care?","volume":"8","year_published":2019},{"abstract":"Due to COVID-19, many people turned their homes into temporary working or learning spaces.

For remote collaboration, between the level of platform and tool, there is still a missing layer of product that can connect hybrid co-creation experience virtually and physically. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to assist and amplify the remote co-creation experience that bridges learning and collaboration between the tangible world and digital meetings by experimenting with designing the material and process of a remote co-creation workshop. The outcome is the redesign of remote co-creation experience, which enhances cross-disciplinary collaboration, diversifies the format and interaction of online collaboration, facilitates meaningful and efficient communication, extends the co-creation experience from online to offline, encapsulates its service into an education and co-creation learning toolkit—MAKE TO:GATHER, in order to make a positive and meaningful social impact.","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Sheng-Hung","initials":"S","last_name":"Lee"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Ziyuan","initials":"Z","last_name":"Zhu"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Simone","initials":"S","last_name":"Mora"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Joseph F.","initials":"JF","last_name":"Coughlin"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-08-25T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"14","fields_of_study":[],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"047-223-342-243-55X","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"book chapter","references":[],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[],"publisher":"Routledge","title_full":"Embracing the Future: Creative Industries for Environment and Advanced Society 5.0 in a Post-Pandemic Era"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"9","title":"Manufacturing creative impact: Co-creation toolkits and service design for remote hybrid collaboration experience","volume":null,"year_published":2022},{"abstract":"Technological advances have made possible industrial and commercial applications of artificial intelligence, virtual reality and highly integrated manufacturing systems. It has also freed business activity from a focus on place, as both work activities and markets have been able to harness information and communication technologies in order to operate remotely. As a result, researchers have highlighted a phenomenon of ‘smart’ working. Some have pointed to a fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) in which ‘smart’ factories use robotics to achieve high performance. There is now a suggestion of progress towards Industry 5.0, in which technological and social systems work in harmony to deliver personalised mass customization of products and services. This paper examines these developments from the perspective of unique, individual understandings of work roles and sustainability, posing the questions ‘Smart’ from whose point of view? Do smart systems promote sustainable organizations? How should design of smart systems be approached? It suggests that contemporary socio-technical systems approaches to organizational analysis are the best way to support harnessing of smart technologies in organizations.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"SE"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"187531555"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.4514.4"},{"type":"fundref","value":"501100003252"},{"type":"wikidata","value":"q218506"},{"type":"ror","value":"012a77v79"}],"name":"Lund

Perspectives on Smart Working: Creating Meaningful and Sustainable Systems","volume":"22","year_published":2019},{"abstract":"Abstract A commixture of gasphase compounds including carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and trace metals were collected at a site located at the urban/industrial interface in Houston, Texas. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis yielded nine factors: gas/crude oil (21.3±5.5%), isoprene emission (17.0±7.1%), Si-rich (14.6±1.3%), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) (11.2±4.0%), traffic (10.6±0.4%), Fluidized-bed Catalytic Cracking (FCC)/high temperature operations (7.2±4.3%), oil refinery (6.8±0.9%), soil and road dust (6.2±0.6%), and petrochemical industries (5.0±5.0%). Daytime and nighttime PMF runs were carried out to see potential differences among and within emission sources. Notable findings include: (1) Nocturnal isoprene emission was identified from traffic exhaust and industrial sources. (2) LPG emissions were higher during the day most likely due to temperature dependent evaporative processes. (3) V/Ni and SO2/V ratios reveal greater contribution from crude oil in the merged natural gas/crude oil emission factor. Corrosion might be responsible for emitting metals (i.e., Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni) from oil refineries during nighttime. (4) In the soil and road dust factor, metals relevant to plant physiological processes are mostly retained by the plants while the lanthanoids and other metals (i.e. Y, Pb, Mn, Ga, Ba) are more prone to physical removal during the day. (5) FCC/high temperature operations are dominated by metals at night. (6) The traffic factor increases during the day possibly due to the higher number of vehicles. Bivariate polar plots suggest the Houston Ship Channel area as the primary emission source for LPG, natural gas/crude oil, FCC/high temperature operations, and petrochemical industries.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"US"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"44461941"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.266436.3"},{"type":"ror","value":"048sx0r50"}],"name":"University

the fourth industrial revolution. The theme of Industry 4.0 is \"Smart Manufacturing for the Future\". Now, some futurists even discuss what the fifth industrial revolution’s theme will be. There are a few visions for Industry 5.0. One emerging theme is human-robot co-working. In recent years, we have seen significant advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) research. Today, there are robots for various purposes at affordable prices in the market. It is not long before we closely interact with robots in our lives and workplaces. Testing autonomous cars in traffic is a promising example of this upcoming trend. There are companies having an employee record for robots or AI applications. While there are many studies on human-robot collaboration for low-level tasks with a focus on robot development, we lack studies focusing on organizational issues emerging from human-robot co-working. In this study, we discuss the possible issues related to human-robot co-working from the organizational and human employee’s perspective. We believe the issues identified in this study will be the focus of many upcoming organizational robotics research studies.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"TR"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"109297418"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.448834.7"},{"type":"ror","value":"01sdnnq10"}],"name":"Gebze Institute of Technology"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Kadir Alpaslan","initials":"KA","last_name":"Demir"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"TR"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"109297418"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.448834.7"},{"type":"ror","value":"01sdnnq10"}],"name":"Gebze Institute of Technology"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Gözde","initials":"G","last_name":"Döven"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"TR"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"109297418"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.448834.7"},{"type":"ror","value":"01sdnnq10"}],"name":"Gebze Institute of Technology"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Bülent","initials":"B","last_name":"Sezen"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":null},"end_page":"695","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Vision"},{"name":"Human–robot interaction"},{"name":"Artificial intelligence"},{"name":"Applications of artificial intelligence"},{"name":"Perspective (graphical)"},{"name":"Theme (narrative)"},{"name":"Robotics"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Industrial Revolution"},{"name":"Knowledge management"},{"name":"Robot"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"049-816-999-056-296","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"012-443-495-193-340"},{"lens_id":"021-292-565-252-002"},{"lens_id":"028-232-581-949-707"},{"lens_id":"059-651-423-638-701"},{"lens_id":"067-426-451-375-880"},{"lens_id":"087-963-242-687-49X"},{"lens_id":"122-072-155-124-945"}],"scholarly_citations_count":138,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"print","value":"18770509"}],"publisher":"Elsevier BV","title_full":"Procedia Computer Science"},"source_urls":[{"type":"unknown","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1877050919312748"},{"type":"html","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050919312748"}],"start_page":"688","title":"Industry 5.0 and Human-Robot Co-working","volume":"158","year_published":2019},{"abstract":"<jats:p>In the era of Society 5.0, the role of communication technology was further enhanced so that it made it easier for humans in various aspects, such as economic, social, cultural, educational, health, business, and so on.

To maintain production and adjust quickly to technological transformation, innovative work-based learning approaches are emphasized. Intelligent machines are becoming capable of interaction and collaboration with humans. They not only introduce a new type of learnable workforce to manufacturing but may open opportunities to enhance learning of all learners. Symbiotic relationships of humans and machines have wide potential for human-centric manufacturing (aka Industry 5.0). Moreover, connecting smart devices and deploying self-learning solutions is envisioned to increase flexibility of manufacturing, thus changing work division between humans and machines. Where humans and machines collaborate, the term Reciprocal Learning has been coined to describe the process of bidirectional learning. While a definition of Reciprocal Learning exists the boundary conditions of the concept are still ambiguous. In this paper, a framework for Reciprocal Learning in Human-Machine Collaboration for Industry 5.0 is presented to clarify what it is and what it isn’t. The approach is based on a multi-agent system perspective, comprising human and machine agents.

The purpose of the article is to reveal the main content of disruptive technologies and related socio-economic processes that occur during the three industrial revolutions. Based on a retrospective analysis of socio-economic revolutions in human history, the popular scientific essay explains the logic and development of technical and social systems. The article shows how the change of production forces and economic relations influences the ratio of individual components in the essential triad of man: bio-socio-labor. The content of the three industrial revolutions that humanity experiences today is revealed separately (Industry 3.0, Industry 4.0, Industry 5.0). It is explained that the works that launched these revolutions took place in the European countries. In particular, the Third Industrial Revolution is aimed at solving the problems of the global environmental crisis. The key transformation tools are alternative energy, additive technologies based on 3D printers, horizontal network structures of production and consumption. The main direction of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is the creation of a unified network of cyber-physical systems capable of working without humans. One of its leading forms is the Internet of Things. The humanization of socio-economic development is a key objective of the Fifth Industrial Revolution, which is focused on achieving the maximum realization of the creative potential of the human-social basis. The focus is on the key processes of the three industrial revolutions and the changes that take place in the essential triad of man.

Grounding on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Socio-Technical Systems theory (STS), this study proposes a conceptual model to better understanding critical factors that influence the acceptance of cobots and how these factors can drive perceived work performance improvement in the organizational level. This study was conducted by catching the critical issue, reviewing the literature on the subject of this study, identifying previous research gaps, and subsequently developing constructs of the model. As a result, this study offers valuable contributions to robotics and manufacturing literature and further suggests empirical research to generally examine and validate the conceptual model.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"ID"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I4210120051"},{"type":"ror","value":"02tmeqq57"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.510759.f"}],"name":"Universitas Internasional Semen Indonesia"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Grandys Frieska","initials":"GF","last_name":"Prassida"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I192652400"}],"name":"Telkom Institute of Technology"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Ully","initials":"U","last_name":"Asfari"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":null},"end_page":"67","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Conceptual model"},{"name":"Context (archaeology)"},{"name":"Knowledge management"},{"name":"Empirical research"},{"name":"Robot"},{"name":"Perspective (graphical)"},{"name":"Robotics"},{"name":"Manufacturing"},{"name":"Artificial intelligence"},{"name":"Management science"},{"name":"Process management"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"057-931-598-875-171","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"011-063-346-104-067"},{"lens_id":"017-415-713-662-955"},{"lens_id":"019-592-986-146-286"},{"lens_id":"027-192-978-746-115"},{"lens_id":"031-004-648-251-391"},{"lens_id":"035-910-998-453-970"},{"lens_id":"038-607-960-776-86X"},{"lens_id":"047-344-167-153-151"},{"lens_id":"057-981-589-705-723"},{"lens_id":"059-424-427-267-469"},{"lens_id":"071-833-629-169-199"},{"lens_id":"103-294-539-938-272"},{"lens_id":"103-900-460-274-941"},{"lens_id":"113-830-545-572-413"},{"lens_id":"127-574-055-241-513"},{"lens_id":"128-570-207-057-247"},{"lens_id":"134-692-988-441-892"},{"lens_id":"143-875-130-007-110"},{"lens_id":"165-713-448-765-487"},{"lens_id":"179-325-125-515-161"}],"scholarly_citations_count":2,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"unknown","value":"18770509"}],"publisher":"Elsevier BV","title_full":"Procedia Computer Science"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"61","title":"A conceptual model for the acceptance of collaborative robots in industry 5.0","volume":"197","year_published":2022},{"abstract":"<jats:p>Modern-day agriculture supply chains have evolved from sovereign and autonomous local stakeholders to a worldwide interconnected system of multiple participants linked by complicated interactions, impacting the production, processing, transportation, and delivery of food to end consumers. Regular instances of fraudulent acts reveal a lack of openness in agriculture supply chains, raising worries about financial losses, eroding customer trust, and lowering corporate brand value. To develop an efficient and reliable trading environment, several fundamental modifications in the present supply chain architecture are required. There is broad consensus that blockchain can improve transparency in agriculture-food supply chains (agri-food SCs). Consumers now demand safe, sustainable, and equitable food production processes, and businesses are using blockchains and the internet of things to meet these needs. For enhanced responsiveness in agri-food SCs, new concepts have evolved that combine blockchains with various Industry 5.0 technologies (e.g., blockchain technology, big data, internet of things (IoT), radio frequency identification (RFID), near field communication (NFC), etc.). It is critical to cut through the hype and examine the technology’s limits, which might stymie its acceptance, implementation, and scalability in agri-food supply chains. This study presents Agri-SCM-BIoT (Agriculture Supply Chain Management using Blockchain and Internet of things) architecture to address the storage and scalability optimization, interoperability, security and privacy issues security, and privacy of personal data along with storage concerns with present single-chain agriculture supply chain systems. We also discussed the classification of security threats with IoT infrastructure and possible available blockchain-based defense mechanisms. Finally, we discussed the features of the proposed supply chain architecture, followed by a conclusion and future work.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Showkat Ahmad","initials":"SA","last_name":"Bhat"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Nen-Fu","initials":"N","last_name":"Huang"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Ishfaq Bashir","initials":"IB","last_name":"Sofi"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Muhammad","initials":"M","last_name":"Sultan"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2021-12-30T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"40","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Interoperability"},{"name":"Supply chain"},{"name":"Blockchain"},{"name":"Food security"},{"name":"Supply chain management"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Transparency (behavior)"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Computer security"}],"funding":[{"country":null,"funding_id":null,"org":"Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) Taiwan"}],"issue":"1","keywords":[],"lens_id":"058-435-708-506-507","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"001-575-048-190-178"},{"lens_id":"001-606-709-712-762"},{"lens_id":"005-538-820-037-56X"},{"lens_id":"007-021-533-558-662"},{"lens_id":"008-763-190-671-901"},{"lens_id":"010-030-925-144-197"},{"lens_id":"011-534-641-706-632"},{"lens_id":"012-209-739-929-356"},{"lens_id":"013-185-357-772-19X"},{"lens_id":"013-598-698-531-007"},{"lens_id":"013-736-377-693-518"},{"lens_id":"014-723-740-360-659"},{"lens_id":"016-471-692-528-473"},{"lens_id":"019-977-371-875-535"},{"lens_id":"020-666-741-983-902"},{"lens_id":"023-449-538-799-139"},{"lens_id":"024-463-458-863-126"},{"lens_id":"027-681-208-484-048"},{"lens_id":"030-320-169-037-724"},{"lens_id":"030-573-966-607-238"},{"lens_id":"031-222-831-930-11X"},{"lens_id":"034-177-271-335-572"},{"lens_id":"035-854-491-687-045"},{"lens_id":"037-594-929-571-907"},{"lens_id":"039-063-316-090-73X"},{"lens_id":"039-489-840-826-641"},{"lens_id":"042-534-287-049-813"},{"lens_id":"046-916-198-091-648"},{"lens_id":"054-148-871-058-508"},{"lens_id":"054-929-632-608-906"},{"lens_id":"054-939-455-814-459"},{"lens_id":"057-942-097-777-139"},{"lens_id":"059-568-697-629-880"},{"lens_id":"059-867-085-774-729"},{"lens_id":"063-365-805-979-031"},{"lens_id":"065-817-707-149-461"},{"lens_id":"066-775-281-325-512"},{"lens_id":"071-324-787-283-047"},{"lens_id":"072-911-978-157-206"},{"lens_id":"075-189-754-893-11X"},{"lens_id":"081-709-460-993-194"},{"lens_id":"084-372-074-921-756"},{"lens_id":"088-125-215-873-987"},{"lens_id":"090-897-941-536-397"},{"lens_id":"096-263-175-257-148"},{"lens_id":"096-728-779-844-738"},{"lens_id":"107-447-381-048-535"},{"lens_id":"110-560-766-872-958"},{"lens_id":"114-571-117-217-549"},{"lens_id":"118-407-379-070-832"},{"lens_id":"119-651-116-736-381"},{"lens_id":"123-538-451-043-072"},{"lens_id":"127-973-552-749-869"},{"lens_id":"127-975-637-406-696"},{"lens_id":"132-998-955-928-222"},{"lens_id":"136-401-068-183-974"},{"lens_id":"141-599-725-641-830"},{"lens_id":"143-620-662-480-131"},{"lens_id":"151-101-574-903-865"},{"lens_id":"153-834-328-292-57X"},{"lens_id":"158-873-273-790-945"},{"lens_id":"160-684-759-985-979"}],"scholarly_citations_count":17,"source":{"country":"Switzerland","issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"20770472"}],"publisher":"MDPI AG","title_full":"Agriculture"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"40","title":"Agriculture-Food Supply Chain Management Based on Blockchain and IoT: A Narrative on Enterprise Blockchain Interoperability","volume":"12","year_published":2021},{"abstract":"Along with the increasing development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), there has been a change in the learning approach method. Methods of face-to-face learning (conventional) and classrooms as implementation have now changed. The ilearning method approach has turned into the direction of future learning or as a learning age of knowledge. In the world of education, information becomes a vital need to support teaching and learning activities. In the online learning system that applied to iLearning+ information needs become critical needs therein.

Such transformations are intrinsic to human and sustainable value creation. An increasing number of companies, recognising this imminent trend, will need to transform their current classical, solely profit-oriented business models into sustainable business models that also target human, social, and environmental aspects. Various frameworks already exist that support the design of sustainable business models. Practical applications of these frameworks and research on the transformation process in the production domain, which places a special focus on small and medium enterprises, is still scarce. This paper presents the first results from a sustainable business model transformation project on a European SME, which produces 3D printers. The research method applies a single case study design.

The area of AI is an interdisciplinary field, which has been designated as a strategic area in the European Union (EU) approach and a key driver of economic development that can bring solutions to many social challenges and problems. Due to its nature and its tendency to be digitally advanced and smarter with analytics, the financial sector is one of the early adopters of AI and expects multiple benefits from its application, that is, the ability to provide better service in the shortest time possible and at a lower cost. AI in the financial sector is based on an understanding of the business needs of financial organizations, institutions and markets and the ability to connect with technological capabilities. They are powerful tools that completely transform this sector. The basic idea of this paper is to consider where the real value of AI in the financial sector is, i.e. what are the practical aspects and business implications of AI in the financial sector globally. It is common knowledge that evolving technologies have always had a strong impact on the sectors in which they are applied because they give them the opportunity to improve existing manufacturing processes, services, customer experiences, operate more efficiently, achieve cost savings, etc. The aim of this paper is to identify areas of application of AI in the financial sector, and to explore leading AI applications that are changing the financial ecosystem, transforming the financial sector and that have the potential to significantly improve many of its functions. The paper further highlights other implications of AI implementation in the financial sector such as employment - job creation and termination of existing AI-influenced employment, the scope and potential of application in developing countries, the problem of regulation and use in the best interests of man, and the importance of properly managing specific AI risks.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"BA"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"194184283"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.449657.d"},{"type":"ror","value":"022mv6k27"}],"name":"University of East Sarajevo"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Zorica","initials":"Z","last_name":"Golic"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2020-02-10T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"81","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Finance"},{"name":"Human intelligence"},{"name":"Early adopter"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Artificial intelligence"},{"name":"Applications of artificial intelligence"},{"name":"Order (exchange)"},{"name":"Common knowledge"},{"name":"European union"},{"name":"Service (economics)"},{"name":"Analytics"}],"funding":[],"issue":"19","keywords":[],"lens_id":"063-322-831-916-544","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[],"scholarly_citations_count":3,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"19866690"},{"type":"print","value":"18403557"}],"publisher":"National and University Library of the Republic of Srpska","title_full":"ЗБОРНИК РАДОВА ЕКОНОМСКОГ ФАКУЛТЕТА У ИСТОЧНОМ САРАЈЕВУ"},"source_urls":[{"type":"html","url":"https://www.bibliotekabijeljina.rs.ba/index.php/zrefis/article/view/6482"},{"type":"html","url":"https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=828906"},{"type":"pdf","url":"https://doisrpska.nub.rs/index.php/zrefis/article/download/6482/6351"},{"type":"html","url":"https://doisrpska.nub.rs/index.php/zrefis/article/view/6482"},{"type":"core_fulltext","url":"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/287192453.pdf"}],"start_page":"67","title":"FINANCE AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: THE FIFTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND ITS IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL SECTOR","volume":"8","year_published":2020},{"abstract":"The report presents analytical information about the state of play of the processes of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in different areas of the Bulgarian economy and industry.

This study aims to analyze the key performance indicators (KPIs) at «Cities Level» for the smart city concept that is referred to as «Layers» in the master project. KPIs for the concept of a smart city is determined by using the meta-analysis technique. Hence, the three most reputable urban journals issued from 2017 through 2020 are reviewed in this study. In addition to this, models of smart city frameworks/assessment tools/KPIs are reviewed within the context of this paper; environment, economy and governance were found to have domain themes on the urban sustainability according to the literature review. Consequently, efficient and integrated urban management, environmental monitoring and management, public and social services of urban development and sustainability are found to be the most important dimensions in urban and regional planning.

This aim of this paper is to discuss, in a reasoned manner, the importance of literacy in the promotion of sustainability in a digital society. For this purpose, the results of a literature review will be mobilized, as well as our 20 years of experience in teaching and research in the fields of sociology, education and organizations, without forgetting the publications that we have on similar topics, which will be, whenever heuristically relevant, mobilized to substantiate and justify the arguments presented herein. The conclusions show that, in a reality where the digital involves many of the life dimensions—for example, in the form of Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0—the role of literacy and, in particular, digital literacy, are critical in the development of sustainability literacy. For this to be possible, significant training work must be carried out. Furthermore, it is not possible to assume that the access, the skills in its use and the benefits of this wonderful digital world will automatically be grasped and felt by all citizens, in an ideology that must be fought. Only in this way will it be possible to foster sustainability, which must necessarily be inclusive.","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Ana Isabel","initials":"AI","last_name":"Santos"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Sandro","initials":"S","last_name":"Serpa"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2020-01-15T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":null,"fields_of_study":[{"name":"Sociology"},{"name":"Ideology"},{"name":"Digital literacy"},{"name":"Context (language use)"},{"name":"Public relations"},{"name":"Literacy"},{"name":"Sustainability"},{"name":"Promotion (rank)"},{"name":"Forgetting"},{"name":"Politics"}],"funding":[],"issue":"1","keywords":[],"lens_id":"064-912-003-773-548","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"008-555-659-626-264"},{"lens_id":"021-321-686-802-330"},{"lens_id":"029-562-142-424-077"},{"lens_id":"036-297-026-204-017"},{"lens_id":"081-683-836-428-765"}],"scholarly_citations_count":3,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"26422328"},{"type":"print","value":"26422336"}],"publisher":"Scholink Co, Ltd.","title_full":"Journal of Education, Teaching and Social Studies"},"source_urls":[{"type":"pdf","url":"http://www.scholink.org/ojs/index.php/jetss/article/download/2551/2629"},{"type":"html","url":"http://www.scholink.org/ojs/index.php/jetss/article/view/2551/2629"},{"type":"core_fulltext","url":"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/287183766.pdf"}],"start_page":"1","title":"Literacy: Promoting Sustainability in a Digital Society","volume":"2","year_published":2020},{"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a cost-effective method to support the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and is an enabling technology for Industry 5.0. The use of RFID is particularly suited to IIoT as it does not require a line of sight for communication and can be retroactively affixed to non-smart items. However, RFID communication is affected by the properties of the material the tag is affixed to, specifically the material permittivity. Metal is commonly present in smart factory environments and supply chains and impedes RFID communication. A suitable tag design is required to accommodate these challenges and ensure resilience for Industry 5.0 applications. The research presented in this paper has assessed the communication performance of RFID antenna designs with and without metal present beneath the tag. The RFID tag designs that performed reliably in the simulation were manufactured, and their read range was tested on materials of varying relative permittivity and thickness to represent MP and NMP scenarios. The results have verified the robustness of “Cyber” to “Physical” designs and provide recommendations to support practitioner IIoT tag selection.\n</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"GB"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I143804889"},{"type":"ror","value":"04vg4w365"},{"type":"fundref","value":"501100000857"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.6571.5"}],"name":"Loughborough University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"James","initials":"J","last_name":"Tribe"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Steven","initials":"S","last_name":"Hayward"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Katherine","initials":"K","last_name":"van Lopik"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"William G.","initials":"WG","last_name":"Whittow"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Andrew A.","initials":"AA","last_name":"West"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-06-28T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"3917","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Robustness (evolution)"},{"name":"Internet of Things"},{"name":"Radio-frequency identification"},{"name":"Supply chain"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Factory (object-oriented programming)"},{"name":"Industry 4.0"},{"name":"Engineering"},{"name":"Embedded system"}],"funding":[{"country":null,"funding_id":null,"org":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"}],"issue":"5-6","keywords":[],"lens_id":"064-914-086-299-181","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"003-574-818-017-848"},{"lens_id":"005-858-971-252-825"},{"lens_id":"006-000-717-661-614"},{"lens_id":"010-874-227-337-696"},{"lens_id":"012-635-762-249-975"},{"lens_id":"029-051-152-251-523"},{"lens_id":"045-484-156-276-449"},{"lens_id":"051-686-204-823-295"},{"lens_id":"064-119-255-100-928"},{"lens_id":"066-032-702-868-316"},{"lens_id":"068-605-798-715-071"},{"lens_id":"072-084-219-287-388"},{"lens_id":"094-912-338-403-993"},{"lens_id":"096-181-264-208-496"},{"lens_id":"098-271-432-456-619"},{"lens_id":"105-591-186-231-514"},{"lens_id":"108-189-183-258-272"},{"lens_id":"112-596-097-344-02X"},{"lens_id":"112-717-076-088-678"},{"lens_id":"121-891-824-749-09X"},{"lens_id":"131-133-972-142-521"},{"lens_id":"152-707-246-845-89X"},{"lens_id":"163-830-088-771-081"},{"lens_id":"167-525-067-938-633"}],"scholarly_citations_count":1,"source":{"country":"Germany","issn":[{"type":"print","value":"02683768"},{"type":"electronic","value":"14333015"}],"publisher":"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","title_full":"The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"3903","title":"Robust RFID tag design for reliable communication within the Internet of Things","volume":"121","year_published":2022},{"abstract":"In recent years manufacturing and assembly lines are undergoing workplace changes with a scope to adapt to the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) design principles. Automation of manufacturing, collaborative robots (cobots), interconnection of cyber physical systems (CPS), cloud computing, big data analytics and Augmented/Virtual reality (AR/VR) are some of the technologies that are being introduced in industry. Human operators are required to adapt and integrate into those new environments. Human operators should be flexible in their work-tasks, upgrade their skillset and be able to act as a safeguard entity in this complex and dynamic environment. A recent shift in paradigms, the Industry 5.0 concept, focus on the sustainability of the human factor inside the technologies that I4.0 framework introduced, and relates to the ageing workforce issue and the change in individuals’ capabilities. Productivity and safety of the ageing operators in the new workplace environment is causally related to their capabilities. In this research paper, we (i) study the interactions of human operator inside the “smart” workplace and (ii) develop a model using the entropy concept of statistical mechanics. This model can be utilized in the evaluation of human factor inside the complex environment by computing the probability of error based on human operator capabilities.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"IT"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"20272500"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.7367.5"},{"type":"ror","value":"03tc05689"}],"name":"University of Basilicata"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Sotirios","initials":"S","last_name":"Panagou"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"IT"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"20272500"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.7367.5"},{"type":"ror","value":"03tc05689"}],"name":"University of Basilicata"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"F.","initials":"F","last_name":"Fruggiero"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"CA"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"530967"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.68312.3e"},{"type":"fundref","value":"100007891"},{"type":"ror","value":"05g13zd79"}],"name":"Ryerson University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"W.

Concretely, the milestone set for Industry 4.0 was to improve the sustainability and efficiency of production systems. By extension, the emphasis was focused on both the digitization and the digitalization of systems, providing room for further improvement. However, the current technological evolution is more system/machine-oriented, rather than human-oriented. Thus, several countries have begun orchestrating initiatives towards the design and development of the human-centric aspect of technologies, systems, and services, which has been coined as Industry 5.0. The impact of Industry 5.0 will extend to societal transformation, which eventually leads to the generation of a new society, the Society 5.0. The developments will be focused on the social and human-centric aspect of the tools and technologies introduced under the framework of Industry 4.0. Therefore, sustainability and human well-being will be at the heart of what comes next, the Industry 5.0, as a subset of Society 5.0. Industry 5.0 will build on the foundations laid during Industry 4.0 by emphasizing human-centered, resilient, and sustainable design. Consequently, the authors in this research work, through a critical literature review, aim to provide adequate reasoning for considering Industry 5.0 as a framework for enabling the coexistence of industry and emerging societal trends and needs.

Industry 4.0 takes a significant part of everyday life. There is no way. The application of digital life on smart phones, touch screens and smart classrooms may be significant indicators of this. Not just computer information and life but also human-like robotics would take a long time. In the immediate future, you will also see the picture of a modern 5.0 model for manufacturing. Since of emerging technology and increasingly evolving and increasing AI-based approaches, remaining on the top is getting more and more challenging. Robots are much more relevant as now the brain-machine’s technology can be merged with the human mind, as artificial intelligence advances. There are coercive problems in the world economy because efficiency is to be improved without the human workforce being robbed of the manufacturing sector. This paper presents the idea of sustainable business 5.0, where machines are intertwined with the human brain and function as partners rather than rivals, against these obstacles. In addition, the effect of Industry 5.0, which is more likely to create more jobs than to reduce, will be discussed on manufacturing and the economy as a whole. The paper describes modern technology, from IoT to news. Thanks to our view, the integration of these innovations would turn industry 4.0 into industry 5.0.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"IN"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I155125381"},{"type":"ror","value":"02w8ba206"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.448824.6"}],"name":"Galgotias University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Prashant","initials":"P","last_name":"Johri"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"IN"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I155125381"},{"type":"ror","value":"02w8ba206"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.448824.6"}],"name":"Galgotias University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"J.N.","initials":"J","last_name":"Singh"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"IN"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I303593345"},{"type":"ror","value":"01hzdv945"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.411141.0"}],"name":"Chaudhary Charan Singh University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Amit","initials":"A","last_name":"Sharma"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"IN"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I155125381"},{"type":"ror","value":"02w8ba206"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.448824.6"}],"name":"Galgotias University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Deependra","initials":"D","last_name":"Rastogi"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2021-12-10T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":null,"fields_of_study":[{"name":"Industry 4.0"},{"name":"Workforce"},{"name":"Industrial Revolution"},{"name":"Manufacturing"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Digital Revolution"},{"name":"Sustainability"},{"name":"Everyday life"},{"name":"Robot"},{"name":"Robotics"},{"name":"Artificial intelligence"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Industrial organization"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"066-680-569-560-085","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"conference proceedings article","references":[],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[],"publisher":"IEEE","title_full":"2021 10th International Conference on System Modeling & Advancement in Research Trends (SMART)"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":null,"title":"Sustainability of Coexistence of Humans and Machines: An Evolution of Industry 5.0 from Industry 4.0","volume":null,"year_published":2021},{"abstract":"Current research on smart contracts focuses on technical, conceptual, and legal aspects but neglects organizational requirements and sustainability impacts. We consider this a significant research gap and explore the relationship between smart contracts and sustainability in supply chains. First, we define the concept of smart contracts in terms of supply chain management. Then, we conduct a content analysis of the literature to explore the overlapping research fields of smart contracts and sustainability in supply chains. Next, we develop a semi-structured assessment framework to model the potential environmental and social impacts induced by smart contracts on supply chains. We propose a conceptual framework for supply chain maturity by mapping the relationships between organizational development, sustainability, and technology. We identify smart contracts as a foundational technology that enables efficient and transparent governance and collaborative self-coordination of human and non-human actors. Thus, we argue that smart contracts can contribute to the economic and social development of networked value chains and Society 5.0. To stimulate interdisciplinary research on smart contracts, we conclude the article by formulating research propositions and trade-offs for smart contracts in the context of technology development, business process and supply chain management, and sustainability.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"AT"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"102248843"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.15788.33"},{"type":"ror","value":"03yn8s215"}],"name":"Vienna

many operations and processes, such as water distribution, preventive maintenance, or smart manufacturing. Paradoxically, IoT technologies and paradigms such as edge computing, although they have a huge potential for the digital transition towards sustainability, they are not yet contributing to the sustainable development of the IoT sector itself. In fact, such a sector has a significant carbon footprint due to the use of scarce raw materials and its energy consumption in manufacturing, operating, and recycling processes. To tackle these issues, the Green IoT (G-IoT) paradigm has emerged as a research area to reduce such carbon footprint; however, its sustainable vision collides directly with the advent of Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI), which imposes the consumption of additional energy. This article deals with this problem by exploring the different aspects that impact the design and development of Edge-AI G-IoT systems. Moreover, it presents a practical Industry 5.0 use case that illustrates the different concepts analyzed throughout the article. Specifically, the proposed scenario consists in an Industry 5.0 smart workshop that looks for improving operator safety and operation tracking. Such an application case makes use of a mist computing architecture composed of AI-enabled IoT nodes. After describing the application case, it is evaluated its energy consumption and it is analyzed the impact on the carbon footprint that it may have on different countries. Overall, this article provides guidelines that will help future developers to face the challenges that will arise when creating the next generation of Edge-AI G-IoT systems.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Computer Science, Universidade da Coruña, 15071 A Coruña,

conduct, in an effective way, the non-destructive testing (NDT) of products—in particular, the fluorescent penetrant inspection (FPI)—remains a challenge. Therefore, the aim of this work is to propose the method of support in the choice of a fluorescent penetrant to be used in FPI research. In the results of the usage of the proposed procedure, it is demonstrated that it is possible to reduce the negative impacts on the environment by FPI processes (through sustainability), while including other criteria, i.e., financial, security, productive (Industry 4.0), and societal (Society 5.0) criteria. The essence of the proposed method is to integrate two methods of decision support. These were the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method and the cost–quality analysis (AKJ). Using the AHP method, the quality level of fluorescent penetrant (to the satisfaction of the customer)—which included the sustainability criteria—are calculated. These criteria include natural environment, reactivity, combustibility, level of sensitivity, and type of washing (emulsification). Then, with the help of the AKJ, the most favorable penetrant—in terms of quality and cost—is calculated and, thus, indicated. This choice must include the concept of sustainable development. Therefore, this method can be used to choose fluorescent penetrants in manufacturing and service enterprises which carry out FPI.","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Andrzej","initials":"A","last_name":"Pacana"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Dominika","initials":"D","last_name":"Siwiec"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Lucia","initials":"L","last_name":"Bednárová"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2020-07-21T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":null,"fields_of_study":[{"name":"Production engineering"},{"name":"Decision support system"},{"name":"Risk analysis (engineering)"},{"name":"Penetrant (mechanical, electrical, or structural)"},{"name":"Industry 4.0"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Sustainable development"},{"name":"Sustainability"},{"name":"Analytic hierarchy process"}],"funding":[],"issue":"14","keywords":[],"lens_id":"067-843-116-643-056","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"000-695-363-143-021"},{"lens_id":"001-842-499-591-863"},{"lens_id":"001-887-301-897-744"},{"lens_id":"004-642-342-861-629"},{"lens_id":"006-594-057-855-368"},{"lens_id":"011-106-244-334-010"},{"lens_id":"011-724-273-890-292"},{"lens_id":"012-451-646-595-321"},{"lens_id":"013-526-888-036-979"},{"lens_id":"025-204-020-416-209"},{"lens_id":"027-524-461-508-120"},{"lens_id":"028-257-664-690-72X"},{"lens_id":"039-625-408-739-067"},{"lens_id":"044-973-839-302-205"},{"lens_id":"045-958-252-943-055"},{"lens_id":"048-005-247-699-306"},{"lens_id":"048-367-322-572-662"},{"lens_id":"050-174-715-361-031"},{"lens_id":"051-120-994-778-317"},{"lens_id":"056-726-706-416-396"},{"lens_id":"060-448-559-184-720"},{"lens_id":"061-685-589-759-148"},{"lens_id":"065-618-957-717-028"},{"lens_id":"070-434-271-190-238"},{"lens_id":"072-616-966-045-045"},{"lens_id":"090-240-669-538-468"},{"lens_id":"091-160-847-313-218"},{"lens_id":"092-689-613-642-891"},{"lens_id":"097-634-746-363-654"},{"lens_id":"099-739-355-853-289"},{"lens_id":"101-796-787-904-60X"},{"lens_id":"103-087-756-682-224"},{"lens_id":"112-550-601-656-329"},{"lens_id":"114-153-171-038-419"},{"lens_id":"114-503-012-687-531"},{"lens_id":"115-376-146-084-776"},{"lens_id":"116-593-224-234-432"},{"lens_id":"116-843-377-466-815"},{"lens_id":"121-003-531-516-657"},{"lens_id":"124-054-699-293-927"},{"lens_id":"124-771-719-128-737"},{"lens_id":"142-455-787-660-889"},{"lens_id":"150-522-574-730-342"},{"lens_id":"151-279-079-872-051"},{"lens_id":"160-330-254-622-824"},{"lens_id":"162-535-415-660-234"},{"lens_id":"169-811-077-960-850"},{"lens_id":"172-888-793-850-904"},{"lens_id":"177-457-269-965-665"},{"lens_id":"194-379-240-058-469"}],"scholarly_citations_count":16,"source":{"country":"Switzerland","issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"20711050"}],"publisher":"MDPI AG","title_full":"Sustainability"},"source_urls":[{"type":"html","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/14/5854"},{"type":"pdf","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/14/5854/pdf"},{"type":"html","url":"https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jsusta/v12y2020i14p5854-d387384.html"}],"start_page":"5854","title":"Method of Choice: A Fluorescent Penetrant Taking into Account Sustainability Criteria","volume":"12","year_published":2020},{"abstract":"Perkembangan teknologi sistem informasi berkembang cukup pesat sehingga berdampak pada bermunculannya trend dari Revousi Industri 4.0  dan Society 5.0.

A systematic literature review method was used to get evidence from the current knowledge linked to this theme. The results have evidenced a strong gap related to Industry 5.0 approaches for the supply chain field. Forty-one (41) publications, including conference and journal papers, have been found in the literature. Nineteen (19) words, which were grouped in four (4) clusters, have been identified in the data analysis. This was the basis to form the four (4) constructs of Industry 5.0: Industry Strategy, Innovation and Technologies, Society and Sustainability, and Transition Issues. Then, an alignment with the supply chain context was proposed, being the basis for the incipient Supply Chain 5.0 framework and its research agenda. Industry 5.0 is still in an embryonic and ideal stage. The literature is scarce and many other concepts and discoveries are going to emerge. Although this literature review is based on few available sources, it provides insightful and novel concepts related to Industry 5.0 in the supply chain context. Moreover, it presents a clear set of constructs and a structured research agenda to encourage researchers in deploying further conceptual and empirical works linked to the subject herein explored. Organizations’ leadership, policymakers, and other practitioners involved in supply chains, and mainly those currently working with Industry 4.0 initiatives, can benefit from this research by having clear guidance regarding the dimensions needed to structurally design and implement an Industry 5.0 strategy.

This implies one to redefine the human-robot collaboration, making it not only safe, but also more inclusive for the operator. Nowadays, this goal is viable thanks to the integration of new sensors in the work cell. Coupled with advanced control strategies, they give the robot a better understanding of both the surrounding environment and the human movement, allowing a more organic cooperation. This paper exploits an RGBD camera and Deep Learning algorithms to retrieve the 3D positions of the manipulated objects in the workspace and to infer the most likely future human destinations in a pick and place case study. Merging this information, a proper control logic is defined and tested in a real robotics application, with the final intent of minimizing human-robot collisions during the collaboration and making the process more reliable and efficient.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"IT"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I93860229"},{"type":"ror","value":"01nffqt88"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.4643.5"}],"name":"Politecnico di Milano"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Federico","initials":"F","last_name":"Formica"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"IT"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I93860229"},{"type":"ror","value":"01nffqt88"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.4643.5"}],"name":"Politecnico di Milano"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Stefano","initials":"S","last_name":"Vaghi"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"IT"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I93860229"},{"type":"ror","value":"01nffqt88"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.4643.5"}],"name":"Politecnico di Milano"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Niccolo","initials":"N","last_name":"Lucci"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"IT"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I93860229"},{"type":"ror","value":"01nffqt88"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.4643.5"}],"name":"Politecnico di Milano"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Andrea M.","initials":"AM","last_name":"Zanchettin"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2021-12-06T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":null,"fields_of_study":[{"name":"Workspace"},{"name":"Robotics"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Artificial intelligence"},{"name":"Robot"},{"name":"Process (computing)"},{"name":"Exploit"},{"name":"Human–robot interaction"},{"name":"Human–computer interaction"},{"name":"SMT placement equipment"},{"name":"Artificial neural network"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"072-113-847-455-872","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"conference proceedings article","references":[],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[],"publisher":"IEEE","title_full":"2021 20th International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR)"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":null,"title":"Neural Networks based Human Intent Prediction for Collaborative Robotics Applications","volume":null,"year_published":2021},{"abstract":"This article provides a review about how uncertainties in increasingly complex production and supply chains should be addressed in scheduling tasks. Uncertainty management will be particularly important in Industry 5.0 solutions that will require the close integration of operators and technical systems. To prepare for these challenging developments, this work reviews the sources of uncertainty and the scheduling algorithms that deal with the different types of models developed to handle the uncertain nature of the elements and the environment of complex technological systems. The paper not only identifies the challenges, but also the main building blocks that can help to manage and reduce uncertainties based on the I4.0 and I5.0 solutions. We hope that this study will serve as a starting point for R&#x0026;D projects and algorithm developments, which will be needed primarily in the field of multi-agent, multistage and inverse

The renewal of a culture of design and business innovation in the area of fashion and textile design is based on the establishment of bridges with different realities that, increasingly dynamic, change the landscape of different products and their creation processes, blurring the boundaries and limits of each area of intervention and its actors. From the small to the big industry we find new needs and professions that project themselves into the future reaching from the past, as in the case of new craft productions that value the identity, artistic and cultural heritage of each geography, supported by new materials and technologies of Industry 5.0. This new dynamic of integrated work, where everyone contributes to enhance the knowledge of each participant, enabling the renewal of knowledge and the development of innovation and social, cultural, and economic inclusion, needs greater support and connection between academia and the creative and productive reality on the ground. The present research group, sustained by the interpretation of the paths of work innovation in the coming decades, intended to provide a contribution to the industry and the culture of national or international design innovation, through research based on the identification of the knowledge and skills necessary for the future training of fashion designers.The adoption of a qualitative and quantitative methodology should allow the collection of data that can indicate trends of needs of future designers and the need to adapt the academy to these new realities. With this study we intend to establish a network of relationships between the different actors in the process of creation and innovation, as well as promote a greater connection between the different forms of creation and production that allow to satisfy the final consumer and their needs around fashion and textiles.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Gianni","initials":"G","last_name":"Montagna"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Maria","initials":"M","last_name":"Delgado"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Isabel","initials":"I","last_name":"Duarte De Almeida"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Luís","initials":"L","last_name":"Santos"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":null},"end_page":null,"fields_of_study":[],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"073-518-853-999-325","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"conference proceedings article","references":[],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"print","value":"27710718"}],"publisher":"AHFE International","title_full":"Human Factors for Apparel and Textile Engineering"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":null,"title":"New skills for new designers: Fashion and Textiles","volume":null,"year_published":2022},{"abstract":"Today, industrial values have led to a new step in evolution. industrial, namely the implementation of Industry 5.0.

The enabling factor of this paradigmis the Science of Where and the thesis that the Science of Where is the enabling factor of the paradigm thatimplements Society 5.0 is fascinating, but has to be demonstrated. In order to prove this thesis, holistic experimentationis necessary, which involves all the actors present in the theater of society in order to demonstratethe benefits of this philosophy in this field through the exercise of good practices. For this reason,ESRI Italia recently set up a laboratory to conduct experiments at its regional office in Cagliari (Italy). Theexperimentation is scheduled in a project called Sardinia 5.0.

To realize this, we propose an architecture that integrates forecasts, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, supports collecting users’ feedback and uses Active Learning and Simulated Reality to enhance forecasts and provide decision-making recommendations. The architecture security is addressed at all levels. We align the proposed architecture with the Big Data Value Association Reference Architecture Model.

The history of planning and social partnership, the courses of nationalisation and privatisation and the problem of damaging the state are discussed as well. The author concludes that the crisis has not resulted in the strengthening of the developmental or welfare role of the state, the evolution of a “developmental welfare state” has become less likely in Ireland in the course of crisis management. Another lesson is that the state can manage certain bad assets of the private sector in a way that yields a profit to the public. There are other costs of the crisis management, however, which are to be paid by the people and result in a decrease of state ownership and a shrinking of the welfare systems.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Senior Research Fellow at the Centre for Economic and Regional Studies, HAS Institute of World Economics and Habil.

The work is based on a consultation with experts representing different kind of companies, industrial sectors, function, role in the SC and research fields. Results lead to the identification of possible SCs for the future, and among them, three solutions seems to particularly fit current challenges related to the evolution of society: Human-centric SC, SC for active citizens and SC in urban context. According to the identified SCs, specific issues are presented and possible solutions basing on new technologies have been mapped with the support of experts. The need to integrate strategies at industrial and societal level urge thus for a new holistic way where business eco-system capabilities merge with civil society needs for have people wellbeing as a major priority.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"CNR-IEIIT, Padova, Italy"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Rosanna","initials":"R","last_name":"Fornasiero"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"CNR-STIIMA, Milano, Italy"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Andrea","initials":"A","last_name":"Zangiacomi"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2021-08-31T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"670","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Supply chain"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Work (electrical)"},{"name":"Process management"},{"name":"Sociocultural evolution"},{"name":"Emerging technologies"},{"name":"Context (language use)"},{"name":"Civil society"},{"name":"Function (engineering)"},{"name":"Identification (information)"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"083-608-958-244-975","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"book chapter","references":[{"lens_id":"000-741-650-622-468"},{"lens_id":"006-062-001-079-024"},{"lens_id":"011-025-043-884-126"},{"lens_id":"014-140-218-278-05X"},{"lens_id":"017-415-713-662-955"},{"lens_id":"021-605-309-335-356"},{"lens_id":"025-213-855-108-41X"},{"lens_id":"037-550-015-414-716"},{"lens_id":"040-593-491-278-928"},{"lens_id":"046-272-160-744-200"},{"lens_id":"048-543-885-373-181"},{"lens_id":"049-767-707-896-077"},{"lens_id":"062-757-415-379-846"},{"lens_id":"062-806-191-230-329"},{"lens_id":"072-394-341-458-543"},{"lens_id":"084-684-418-266-98X"},{"lens_id":"101-884-212-715-250"},{"lens_id":"108-508-607-032-791"},{"lens_id":"113-830-545-572-413"},{"lens_id":"125-134-057-094-789"},{"lens_id":"126-042-692-951-426"},{"lens_id":"132-426-334-633-727"},{"lens_id":"160-371-526-060-230"},{"lens_id":"170-912-030-345-381"}],"scholarly_citations_count":2,"source":{"country":"Germany","issn":[{"type":"print","value":"18684238"},{"type":"electronic","value":"1868422x"}],"publisher":"Springer International Publishing","title_full":"Advances in Production Management Systems.

Kata kunci: genetik; Indonesia; keragaman; informasi; teknologi ABSTRACT Indonesia stores abundant genetik resources but has weaknesses in its database. This becomes a gap in the biopiracy of the pharmaceutical companies in developed countries. The development of information technology entered the era of technology 4.0 and society 5.0. Legal protection of genetik resources in terms of regulation and institutions as well as optimization of information technology in non-juridical protection. The research method used is juridical normative with descriptive analysis approach. Data was collected through literature study and interviews and analyzed using qualitative juridical methods. Indonesia does not yet have specific rules regarding genetik resources. The Convention on Biological Diversity, the Cartagena Protocol and the Nagoya Protocol are not yet optimal because they are not supported by developed countries that apply double standards. The development of information technology is both an opportunity and a challenge. Information technology can be a means of compiling a database of abundant and diverse genetik resources. The use of information technology is absolutely necessary and can be a means of proving electronically and efforts to prevent claims from other countries.

Attempts are made to offer – starting from an upgrade of knowledge and educational paths – a new innovative society (known as Society 5.0 or Super Smart Society) where companies and territorial stakeholders are a part of complex relation systems leading to the creation of new sustainable and intertwined supply chains (territorial networking), also with the support of properly designed tools such as the service platforms. In this scenario, design develops new planning visions based on relational paradigms and represents the bridge between technological innovation and social contexts since it is able to plan technology by harmonizing cultural, social, economical and political elements.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"IT"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"45084792"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.8404.8"},{"type":"fundref","value":"501100004434"},{"type":"ror","value":"04jr1s763"}],"name":"University of Florence"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Irene","initials":"I","last_name":"Fiesoli"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2021-01-26T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"708","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Supply chain"},{"name":"Vision"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Process management"},{"name":"Circular economy"},{"name":"Bridge (interpersonal)"},{"name":"Service (systems architecture)"},{"name":"Plan (drawing)"},{"name":"Strategic design"},{"name":"Politics"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"090-218-595-286-315","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"book chapter","references":[{"lens_id":"038-317-334-957-887"},{"lens_id":"081-299-086-476-760"},{"lens_id":"092-327-604-136-796"},{"lens_id":"097-908-934-337-344"},{"lens_id":"146-185-555-861-882"}],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"print","value":"21945357"},{"type":"electronic","value":"21945365"}],"publisher":"Springer International Publishing","title_full":"Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing"},"source_urls":[{"type":"html","url":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-68017-6_104"},{"type":"html","url":"https://flore.unifi.it/handle/2158/1241873"}],"start_page":"703","title":"Blended Design Strategies to Plan Again the New Territorial Networking and Its Interconnections","volume":null,"year_published":2021},{"abstract":"In order to realize the goals of Industry 5.0 (I5.0), which has data interoperability as one of its core principles, the future research in the Supply Chain (SC) visibility has to be aligned with socially, economically and environmentally sustainable objectives. Within the purview of circular economy, this paper indicates various aspects and implications of data sharing in the SCs in light of the published research. Taking into consideration the heterogeneity of data sources and standards, this article also catalog all the major data-sharing technologies being employed in sharing data digitally across the SCs. Drawing on the published research from 2015 to 2021, following the PRISMA framework, this paper presents the state of research in the field of data sharing in SCs in terms of their standardization, optimization, simulation, automation, security and more notably sustainability. Using the co-occurrence metric, bibliometric analysis has been conducted such that the collected research is categorized under various keyword clusters and regional themes. This article brings together two major themes in reviewing the research in the field. Firstly, the bibliometric analysis of the published articles makes manifest the contours of the current state of research and the future possibilities in the field. Secondly, in synthesizing the research on the foundations of sustainability within the CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework, this article deals with the various aspects and implications of information sharing in the SCs. By bringing these two themes together, this paper affords a prospective researcher with the research vis-à-vis the information sharing in SC, starting from the actual data standards in use to the modality and consequence of their application within the perspective of the circular economy. This article, in essence, indicates how all the aspects of data sharing in SCs may be brought together in service of the theme of I5.0.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"HU"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I140275651"},{"type":"ror","value":"03y5egs41"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.7336.1"}],"name":"University

This topic is relevant due to the rapid development of biotechnologies and neural networks, transforming the environment of industries and society as a whole. Various interpretations of the term “fifth industrial revolution” are considered, and the key characteristics of previous industrial revolutions are identified and analysed. The main content of the research paper is an analysis of the scientific literature, consideration of visions of the fifth industrial revolution, as well as the identification of the main opportunities and threats that manufacturing enterprises, industries and society as a whole will face. The impact of Industry 5.0 on the economic performance of industries while meeting the needs and interests of employees, as well as ensuring environmental sustainability and resource conservation is described. The importance of the readiness of future industries to adapt to changing conditions in key value chains is emphasized. Based on the analysis of the scientific literature, the authors have revealed that the fifth industrial revolution will be determined by a new and expanded purposefulness, consisting of three basic elements: human orientation, stability and sustainability. Finally, the importance of balancing production through the development of sustainable strategic value chains, adaptable production capacities and flexible business processes was emphasized.<jats:bold> </jats:bold></jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"111567634"}],"name":"The State University of Management"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Yu.

has paved the way for artificial intelligence (AI) and big data in industries. This implies a substantial integration of AI, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), Robotics, big data, Blockchain, and 5G communications in support of smart manufacturing and the dynamical processes in modern industries. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of different aspects of AI and big data in Industry 4.0 with a particular focus on key applications, techniques, the concepts involved, key enabling technologies, challenges, and research perspective toward deployment of Industry 5.0. In detail, we highlight and analyze how the duo of AI and big data is helping in different applications of Industry 4.0. We also highlight key challenges in a successful deployment of AI and big data solutions in smart industrial applications with a particular emphasis on data-related issues, such as availability, bias, auditing, management, interpretability, communication, and different adversarial attacks and security issues. Finally, we explore the significance of AI and big data toward Industry 4.0 applications through panoramic reviews and discussions. This work is expected to provide a baseline for future research in the domain.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering,

Directions","volume":"9","year_published":2022},{"abstract":"We are only at the beginning of a rapid period of transformation of our economy and society due to the convergence of many digital technologies. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is central to this change and offers major opportunities to improve our lives. The recent developments in AI are the result of increased processing power, improvements in algorithms and the exponential growth in the volume and variety of digital data. Many applications of AI have started entering into our every-day lives, from machine translations, to image recognition, and music generation, and are increasingly deployed in industry, government, and commerce. Connected and autonomous vehicles, and AI-supported medical diagnostics are areas of application that will soon be commonplace. There is strong global competition on AI among the US, China, and Europe. The US leads for now but China is catching up fast and aims to lead by 2030. For the EU, it is not so much a question of winning or losing a race but of finding the way of embracing the opportunities offered by AI in a way that is human-centred, ethical, secure, and true to our core values. The EU Member States and the European Commission are developing coordinated national and European strategies, recognising that only together we can succeed. We can build on our areas of strength including excellent research, leadership in some industrial sectors like automotive and robotics, a solid legal and regulatory framework, and very rich cultural diversity also at regional and sub-regional levels. It is generally recognised that AI can flourish only if supported by a robust computing infrastructure and good quality data: • With respect to computing, we identified a window of opportunity for Europe to invest in the emerging new paradigm of computing distributed towards the edges of the network, in addition to centralised facilities. This will support also the future deployment of 5G and the Internet of Things. • With respect to data, we argue in favour of learning from successful Internet companies, opening access to data and developing interactivity with the users rather than just broadcasting data. In this way, we can develop ecosystems of public administrations, firms, and civil society enriching the data to make it fit for AI applications responding to European needs. We should embrace the opportunities afforded by AI but not uncritically. The black box characteristics of most leading AI techniques make them opaque even to specialists. AI systems are currently limited to narrow and well-defined tasks, and their technologies inherit imperfections from their human creators, such as the well-recognised bias effect present in data. We should challenge the shortcomings of AI and work towards strong evaluation strategies, transparent and reliable systems, and good human-AI interactions. Ethical and secure-by-design algorithms are crucial to build trust in this disruptive technology, but we also need a broader engagement of civil society on the values to be embedded in AI and the directions for future development. This social engagement should be part of the effort to strengthen our resilience at all levels from local, to national and European, across institutions, industry and civil society. Developing local ecosystems of skills, computing, data, and applications can foster the engagement of local communities, respond to their needs, harness local creativity and knowledge, and build a human-centred, diverse, and socially driven AI. We still know very little about how AI will impact the way we think, make decisions, relate to each other, and how it will affect our jobs. This uncertainty can be a source of concern but is also a sign of opportunity. The future is not yet written. We can shape it based on our collective vision of what future we would like to have. But we need to act together and act fast.","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Annoni","initials":"A","last_name":"Alessandro"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Benczur","initials":"B","last_name":"Peter"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Bertoldi","initials":"B","last_name":"Paolo"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Delipetrev","initials":"D","last_name":"Blagoj"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":null,"initials":null,"last_name":"De Prato Giuditta"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Feijóo González","initials":"FG","last_name":"Claudio"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Fernandez Macias","initials":"FM","last_name":"Enrique"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Gomez Gutierrez","initials":"GG","last_name":"Emilia"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Iglesias Portela","initials":"IP","last_name":"Maria"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Junklewitz","initials":"J","last_name":"Henrik"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Lopez Cobo","initials":"LC","last_name":"Montserrat"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Martens","initials":"M","last_name":"Bertin"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Figueiredo Do Nascimento","initials":"FDN","last_name":"Susana"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Nativi","initials":"N","last_name":"Stefano"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Polvora","initials":"P","last_name":"Alexandre"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Sanchez Martin Jose","initials":"SMJ","last_name":"Ignacio"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Tolan","initials":"T","last_name":"Songul"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Tuomi","initials":"T","last_name":"Ilkka"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Vesnic Alujevic","initials":"VA","last_name":"Lucia"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":null},"end_page":null,"fields_of_study":[{"name":"The Internet"},{"name":"Variety (cybernetics)"},{"name":"Psychological resilience"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Interactivity"},{"name":"Government"},{"name":"Artificial intelligence"},{"name":"Applications of artificial intelligence"},{"name":"Civil society"},{"name":"Social engagement"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"091-763-231-123-996","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"book","references":[],"scholarly_citations_count":38,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"18319424"}],"publisher":"Publications Office","title_full":"EUR (Luxembourg.

The new Industry 5.0 has a positive impact on the performance of the logistics. Logistics information system is a root of supply chain to collect the information related to products and track the information and services related to the products in a supply chain manner. A sound logistics information system can lead to cost reduction and can also improve customer satisfaction. However, research on IoT adoption in logistics is acceptance of IoT into supply chain services in specific has been rhetoric. IoT creates far-reaching payoffs for all the operations of logistics among the suppliers and customers. This benefit extends across the entire logistics information system, including inventory, transportation, and delivery system with better efficiency, security, and safety. This chapter is drawn upon the organizational capability theory for developing effects of IoT on logistics management and in turn improves logistics information system as well as organizational performance.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"IN"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"182663762"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.448968.f"},{"type":"ror","value":"01vwns954"}],"name":"Lingaya's

The analysis clearly distinguishes between IoT and IoE, which are wrongly considered to be the same by many commentators. After evaluating the current trends of advancement in the fields of IoT, IoE and IoNT, this paper identifies the 21 most significant current and future challenges as well as scenarios for the possible future expansion of their applications. Despite possible negative aspects of these developments, there are grounds for general optimism about the coming technologies. Certainly, many tedious tasks can be taken over by IoT devices. However, the dangers of criminal and other nefarious activities, plus those of hardware and software errors, pose major challenges that are a priority for further research. Major specific priority issues for research are identified.","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"H.","initials":"H","last_name":"Miraz"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Maaruf","initials":"M","last_name":"Ali"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Peter S.","initials":"PS","last_name":"Excell"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Richard","initials":"R","last_name":"Picking"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2018-07-28T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":null,"fields_of_study":[{"name":"Internet privacy"},{"name":"The Internet"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Internet of Things"}],"funding":[],"issue":"8","keywords":[],"lens_id":"094-019-830-401-584","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"013-333-820-777-358"},{"lens_id":"014-448-058-704-128"},{"lens_id":"020-743-004-622-628"},{"lens_id":"027-642-614-749-345"},{"lens_id":"030-236-109-234-935"},{"lens_id":"032-256-983-461-334"},{"lens_id":"033-769-989-015-562"},{"lens_id":"034-421-875-033-147"},{"lens_id":"035-767-309-093-481"},{"lens_id":"039-010-411-066-018"},{"lens_id":"040-030-069-076-491"},{"lens_id":"050-997-950-548-215"},{"lens_id":"056-565-974-975-456"},{"lens_id":"059-283-293-338-48X"},{"lens_id":"061-789-573-275-006"},{"lens_id":"062-620-099-513-611"},{"lens_id":"080-019-048-706-929"},{"lens_id":"081-978-867-796-50X"},{"lens_id":"084-823-331-685-695"},{"lens_id":"095-714-088-237-003"},{"lens_id":"108-114-708-601-04X"},{"lens_id":"108-268-129-618-383"},{"lens_id":"137-616-902-479-676"}],"scholarly_citations_count":88,"source":{"country":"Switzerland","issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"19995903"}],"publisher":"MDPI AG","title_full":"Future Internet"},"source_urls":[{"type":"html","url":"https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1808.html#abs-1808-09869"},{"type":"html","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/fi10080068"},{"type":"html","url":"https://jglobal.jst.go.jp/en/detail?JGLOBAL_ID=201902212341520320"},{"type":"html","url":"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv180809869M/abstract"},{"type":"pdf","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/10/8/68/pdf"},{"type":"html","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/10/8/68"},{"type":"pdf","url":"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.09869.pdf"},{"type":"html","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09869"},{"type":"html","url":"http://glyndwr.repository.guildhe.ac.uk/17348/"},{"type":"core_fulltext","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09869"}],"start_page":"68","title":"Internet of Nano-Things, Things and Everything: Future Growth Trends","volume":"10","year_published":2018},{"abstract":"With the beginning of the fifth industrial revolution, Artificial Intelligence has changed the nature of work where human needs to be more creative, innovative, and relationship oriented. For a sustainable working environment, the value of emotional and social competencies has increased day by day while Emotional Intelligence (EI) has captured as a pinnacle in Human Resource Development literature. The study focused on the significance of Emotional Intelligence from an occupational perspective.  The findings reveal why an organization should care about the emotional intelligence of its employees. Since an organization can attain a competitive advantage through the people, hence Emotional intelligence could make a difference from an average performer to high-value performer.  In this study, the role of Emotional Intelligence has critically analyzed with the evidence of empirical researches published in peer-reviewed journals.  The study underlines the essentials of EI in job performance, job satisfaction, Organization citizenship behavior, leadership effectiveness, Team Management, Work-life balance and Employee wellbeing. From the Human Resource Development perspective, organization should emphasize on developing Emotional Intelligence of its employees to make them productive, satisfied and committed for achieving organization’s goals and maintaining better working environment.

Industrial equipment such as sensors, controllers, and others are expensive, and upgrading manufacturing equipment in existing facilities is costly. The growing use of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven cost reductions in sensors, controllers, and communications through high volumes of digital devices and value-added components. The manufacturing sector with its massive installed base of legacy equipment has also become an area of interest for the advances in innovative digital technologies. Meanwhile, the next level of innovation in manufacturing has been achieved, labeled by the term 4th Industrial Revolution, in short Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 takes the automation of manufacturing processes to a new level by introducing customized and intelligent production technologies. Machines are connected and communicate with each other to ultimately make decisions, operate independently, or cooperate with humans in a customer-oriented production environment. This raises the question about the key issues of the next industrial enhancement and the term to call it? The change from Industry 4.0 to the next innovative industrial enhancement is termed Industry 5.0. However, Industry 5.0 has its root in the concept of Industry 4.0. Thus, the key issues of the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 can be seen in the goal of making manufacturability sustainable from economic, ecologic and societal perspectives. This requires building a circular economy with a focus on a human centric industry.

This paper explores how data-driven decision-making (DDDM) can enable sustainable and resilient supply chain operations within the manufacturing industry. A series of in-depth interviews were conducted with experts, researchers, and company representatives across the manufacturing industry and universities in Sweden. The findings show a consensus among companies, researchers, and literature about the potential of data utilization for sustainability purposes; however, in most cases, the complete transformation towards data-driven has not happened yet. Companies have uncertainty about what data is needed rather than its lack. Reliability &amp; validity of data become essential to exploit the potential of the data organizations already possess. Based on the literature and interview data, a conceptual model is proposed, including three identified parameters connected to DDDM, 1) data and IT infrastructure, 2) current operations, and 3) an improved triple bottom line performance. The model captures the interconnections between such parameters, depicting the benefits and challenges of DDDM and its relation to more sustainable and resilient supply chain operations within the manufacturing industry. In a data-driven approach, real-time analysis of complex &amp; extensive amounts of data gives unlimited possibilities to improve manufacturing operations through decision-making.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Department of Sustainable Production Development, Södertälje, Sweden"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Zuhara","initials":"Z","last_name":"Chavez"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Department of Sustainable Production Development, Södertälje, Sweden"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Maheshwaran","initials":"M","last_name":"Gopalakrishnan"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Department of Industrial economics and management, Stockholm, Sweden"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Viktor","initials":"V","last_name":"Nilsson"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Department of Industrial economics and management, Stockholm, Sweden"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Arvid","initials":"A","last_name":"Westbroek"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-04-20T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":null,"fields_of_study":[{"name":"Exploit"},{"name":"Supply chain"},{"name":"Sustainability"},{"name":"Digital transformation"},{"name":"Manufacturing"},{"name":"Data-driven"},{"name":"Triple bottom line"},{"name":"Process management"},{"name":"Industry 4.0"},{"name":"Big data"},{"name":"Relation (database)"},{"name":"Reliability (semiconductor)"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Engineering"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"095-952-734-836-902","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"book chapter","references":[],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"unknown","value":"2352751x"},{"type":"unknown","value":"23527528"}],"publisher":"IOS Press","title_full":"Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":null,"title":"Exploring Data-Driven Decision-Making for Enhanced Sustainability","volume":null,"year_published":2022},{"abstract":"<p>Smart wearable technology is taken into account as a paradigm shift in healthcare and health insurance industry.

However, the increasing requirements for customized and personalized products and services, together with the acceleration of the socio-economic environment in the age of Industry 4.0, forced manufacturers to re-evaluate their current MPC strategies that mainly emphasize time, cost and quality priorities. Industry 4.0 presents a solid ambition for transforming to a digital, data-driven and interconnected manufacturing industry centred around cyber-physical convergence. Although the relevance of Industry 4.0 technologies’ disruptions on operations management has been acknowledged, a significant gap in the evolution of the logic and design of MPC systems has been observed. The requirements of on-demand products and services with enhanced flexibility, resilience, sustainability and humanitarianism in this new industrial revolution call for innovations of MPC architectures and approaches. This paper first summarizes the evolution of MPC systems with enabling technologies and the changing business climate at that time. To explore innovative MPC that complies with the increasing economic, social and environmental requirements, the concept of synchronization-oriented MPC with four principles is proposed. Following the principles, a general framework for the synchronization-oriented MPC with enhanced economic, social and environmental benefits is developed. This work potentially provides insights into innovative MPC in the age of Industry 4.0 and even Industry 5.0.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"HK"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I889458895"},{"type":"ror","value":"02zhqgq86"},{"type":"fundref","value":"501100003803"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.194645.b"}],"name":"University of Hong Kong"},{"addresses":[{"country_code":"CN"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I3045169105"},{"type":"ror","value":"049tv2d57"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.263817.9"}],"name":"Southern University of Science and Technology"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Daqiang","initials":"D","last_name":"Guo"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Shiquan","initials":"S","last_name":"Ling"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Yiming","initials":"Y","last_name":"Rong"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"George Q.","initials":"GQ","last_name":"Huang"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":null},"end_page":"168","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Flexibility (engineering)"},{"name":"Industry 4.0"},{"name":"Synchronization (alternating current)"},{"name":"Sustainability"},{"name":"Quality (philosophy)"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Risk analysis (engineering)"}],"funding":[],"issue":"2","keywords":[],"lens_id":"097-679-733-631-241","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"001-011-892-665-374"},{"lens_id":"001-103-459-836-919"},{"lens_id":"001-758-579-687-388"},{"lens_id":"009-980-090-585-966"},{"lens_id":"012-218-887-216-344"},{"lens_id":"013-209-041-019-592"},{"lens_id":"014-796-353-623-217"},{"lens_id":"020-627-235-778-998"},{"lens_id":"036-379-622-440-373"},{"lens_id":"038-905-048-579-484"},{"lens_id":"044-826-117-182-379"},{"lens_id":"045-936-475-493-242"},{"lens_id":"054-566-657-836-198"},{"lens_id":"055-185-113-498-458"},{"lens_id":"057-335-032-266-130"},{"lens_id":"059-424-427-267-469"},{"lens_id":"064-138-810-036-202"},{"lens_id":"082-140-051-993-161"},{"lens_id":"085-056-385-382-296"},{"lens_id":"095-366-405-250-466"},{"lens_id":"102-087-824-667-717"},{"lens_id":"114-257-960-475-300"},{"lens_id":"121-189-721-254-131"},{"lens_id":"126-126-765-625-33X"},{"lens_id":"129-461-000-946-008"}],"scholarly_citations_count":2,"source":{"country":"Austria","issn":[{"type":"print","value":"24058963"},{"type":"unknown","value":"24058971"}],"publisher":"Elsevier BV","title_full":"IFAC-PapersOnLine"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"163","title":"Towards synchronization-oriented manufacturing planning and control for Industry 4.0 and beyond","volume":"55","year_published":2022},{"abstract":"This chapter presents an exhaustive reference analysis and synthesis about the Industry 5.0 development, challenges, and implications.

Physical activity monitoring digital platforms are architected to improve the healthcare status of patients with diabetes and other lifestyle-related diseases. Furthermore, digital platforms are expected to generate profits for health technology companies and help control costs in the healthcare ecosystem. However, current digital enterprise architecture approaches are not well-established, and the potentials have not yet been realized.

It is actually significant that the global system involves a multidimensional and technology-driven structure and that national-states’ regulations occur along with transnational practices. In this system, new technologies have a big role. New technologies consist of some innovations such as artificial intelligence, robotics, big data, internet of things, cloud technology, and so on, that describe the concept of ‘Society 5.0’ proposed by Japan and the concept of ‘Industry 4.0’ proposed by Germany. These technologies create super smart society in terms of their impacts on improving human life. Smart technologies improve human life in the fields of education, health, security, etc. On the other hand, smart technologies used in the process of production shape the global production network and the innovative strategies of firms. It is required that new technologies should not be remained uncontrolled within the logic of ‘laissez faire’ because their impacts and power are so great. Thus, national-states should make efficient economic policies by also considering transnational practices; like that Japan and Germany develop their own national view in terms of Society 5.0 and Industry 4.0. Such fields come into prominence in the economic policies in respect of new technologies: Competition policy on the basis of global competition and innovativeness—Industrialization policy on the basis of emerging industries of new technologies—Intellectual property policy on the basis of the rights of people and firms producing knowledge and innovation—Employment policy on the basis of new occupations and specialities in the global age—Social policy on the basis of new technologies’ control on individual and social life.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"TR"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"193615760"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.21200.31"},{"type":"ror","value":"00dbd8b73"}],"name":"Dokuz Eylül University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Timuçin","initials":"T","last_name":"Yalçınkaya"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2021-04-27T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"163","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Economic policy"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Laissez-faire"},{"name":"Emerging technologies"},{"name":"Control (management)"},{"name":"Production (economics)"},{"name":"Competition (economics)"},{"name":"Process (engineering)"},{"name":"Big data"},{"name":"Cloud computing"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"099-833-332-005-923","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"book chapter","references":[{"lens_id":"015-666-815-227-966"},{"lens_id":"017-415-713-662-955"},{"lens_id":"049-816-999-056-296"},{"lens_id":"054-052-045-969-194"},{"lens_id":"162-717-451-214-458"},{"lens_id":"175-386-977-279-510"}],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"print","value":"25097873"},{"type":"electronic","value":"25097881"}],"publisher":"Springer Singapore","title_full":"Accounting, Finance, Sustainability, Governance & Fraud: Theory and Application"},"source_urls":[{"type":"html","url":"https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-33-6811-8_8"},{"type":"html","url":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-33-6811-8_8"}],"start_page":"139","title":"New Technologies and Economic Policies in the Global System","volume":null,"year_published":2021},{"abstract":"At present, there is no consistent definition of the term «personalized nutrition».

These solutions are commonly built on digital twins, i.e., comprehensive, structured and effective digital representations of the production system and its entities, whose current status is constantly updated by the plugged data sources. The arising of the Industry 5.0 paradigm and the established key role of workers in manufacturing require new Digital Twins to represent also humans. In fact, as cognitive automation becomes more and more pervasive and its behaviour unintelligible to humans, it becomes essential for improving performance and well-being, at the same time, to model humans as data-driven agents and to represent their interaction with the factory systems. Currently, a standardised solution for creating Digital Twins is missing, forcing industrial solution architects to resort to ad-hoc implementations and models. These solutions lack re-usability, scalability and extensibility, preventing the introduction of a human digital representation in existent twins, so hindering the complete shift to the new Industry 5.0 paradigm. In this paper, such limitations are faced by introducing an extensible and flexible IIoT-industrial internet of things-based platform with a twofold benefit: on the one hand, to support the creation of customised data representations of production systems and their entities including humans; on the other hand, to provide a modular infrastructure, along with its interchangeable components, for easy digital twin instantiation and ramp-up. An implementation of the platform has been tested with different applications in a laboratory setting and released as a public resource. Finally, potential future applications of the proposed digital twin are discussed, highlighting its main benefits.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"CH"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I15196421"},{"type":"ror","value":"05ep8g269"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.16058.3a"}],"name":"University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Elias","initials":"E","last_name":"Montini"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"CH"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I15196421"},{"type":"ror","value":"05ep8g269"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.16058.3a"}],"name":"University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Vincenzo","initials":"V","last_name":"Cutrona"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"CH"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I15196421"},{"type":"ror","value":"05ep8g269"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.16058.3a"}],"name":"University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Niko","initials":"N","last_name":"Bonomi"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"CH"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I15196421"},{"type":"ror","value":"05ep8g269"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.16058.3a"}],"name":"University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Giuseppe","initials":"G","last_name":"Landolfi"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"CH"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I15196421"},{"type":"ror","value":"05ep8g269"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.16058.3a"}],"name":"University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Andrea","initials":"A","last_name":"Bettoni"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"IT"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I93860229"},{"type":"ror","value":"01nffqt88"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.4643.5"}],"name":"Politecnico di Milano"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Paolo","initials":"P","last_name":"Rocco"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"CH"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I15196421"},{"type":"ror","value":"05ep8g269"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.16058.3a"}],"name":"University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Emanuele","initials":"E","last_name":"Carpanzano"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":null},"end_page":"667","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Implementation"},{"name":"Modular design"},{"name":"Scalability"},{"name":"Factory (object-oriented programming)"},{"name":"Industry 4.0"},{"name":"Context (archaeology)"},{"name":"Automation"},{"name":"Usability"},{"name":"USable"},{"name":"Data science"},{"name":"Software engineering"},{"name":"Distributed computing"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"101-879-489-782-791","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"002-599-460-164-388"},{"lens_id":"006-824-466-671-376"},{"lens_id":"009-196-394-593-472"},{"lens_id":"009-683-959-159-971"},{"lens_id":"012-302-514-956-35X"},{"lens_id":"013-007-720-642-102"},{"lens_id":"015-228-799-602-614"},{"lens_id":"017-415-713-662-955"},{"lens_id":"019-768-331-540-502"},{"lens_id":"028-466-048-018-180"},{"lens_id":"047-436-453-460-898"},{"lens_id":"068-775-721-617-07X"},{"lens_id":"083-138-344-350-817"},{"lens_id":"085-466-022-073-007"},{"lens_id":"094-019-771-819-795"},{"lens_id":"096-017-941-794-37X"},{"lens_id":"117-587-846-748-601"},{"lens_id":"127-046-613-305-747"},{"lens_id":"129-461-404-099-044"},{"lens_id":"131-206-117-846-231"}],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"unknown","value":"22128271"}],"publisher":"Elsevier BV","title_full":"Procedia CIRP"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"661","title":"An IIoT Platform For Human-Aware Factory Digital Twins","volume":"107","year_published":2022},{"abstract":"The low ability of students to solve problems is in line with the low mastery of science concepts. In this study, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) integrated Project Oriented Problem Based Learning (POPBL) learning models were implemented to improve the mastery of science concepts of junior high school students, especially on the topic of Environmental Pollution. The method used was a mixed-method. The STEM integrated STB learning model design framework consists of 3 stages: Onset Stage, Execution Stage, and Closure Stage. The concept of students is emphasized at the onset stage in the case study dissemination phase. In this phase, students analyze problems based on articles provided by the teacher. The more understanding the material, the more critical students will explore existing issues and find logical solutions to those problems. The results showed that there was a difference between the average pretest and posttest learning outcomes (t=-5,660; df = 53; Sig. (2-tailed) = 0,000). This indicates an increase in junior high school students' science concepts mastery after using the STEM integrated POPBL Learning Model. Improving students' mastery of concepts using a STEM integrated POPBL learning model is still in the low category with n-gain = 0.17. Although still in the low category, the POPBL learning model with the STEM approach can be optimized to improve students' mastery of concepts and skills on other science topics.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"ID"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"130218214"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.443099.3"},{"type":"ror","value":"044b0xj37"}],"name":"Indonesia University of Education"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"E.","initials":"E","last_name":"Eliyawati"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"ID"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"130218214"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.443099.3"},{"type":"ror","value":"044b0xj37"}],"name":"Indonesia University of Education"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Yayan","initials":"Y","last_name":"Sanjaya"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"SMP Karya Prestasi Mandiri  JL Babakan Loa No 44 Padalarang,, Bandung Barat, 40553, Indonesia"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"A.S.","initials":"AS","last_name":"Ramdani"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2020-10-31T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"129","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Mathematics education"},{"name":"Closure (psychology)"},{"name":"Problem-based learning"},{"name":"Environmental pollution"},{"name":"Design framework"},{"name":"Learning models"}],"funding":[],"issue":"2","keywords":[],"lens_id":"102-215-865-270-816","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[],"scholarly_citations_count":1,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"25277634"},{"type":"print","value":"24072311"}],"publisher":"University of Trunojoyo Madura","title_full":"Jurnal Pena Sains"},"source_urls":[{"type":"pdf","url":"https://journal.trunojoyo.ac.id/penasains/article/download/8260/STEM%20Education"},{"type":"html","url":"https://journal.trunojoyo.ac.id/penasains/article/view/8260"},{"type":"core_fulltext","url":"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/348690263.pdf"}],"start_page":"120","title":"IMPLEMENTATION OF PROJECT ORIENTED PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING (POPBL) MODEL INTEGRATED WITH STEM TO ENHANCE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS' SCIENCE CONCEPT MASTERY","volume":"7","year_published":2020},{"abstract":"We aim at creating a society where we can resolve various social challenges by incorporating the innovations of the fourth industrial revolution (e.g. IoT, big data, AI, robot, and the sharing economy) into every industry and social life.

Internet of Things (IoT) has a vital role in the smart city for vaccine manufacturing with wearable sensors. According to the advanced services in intelligent manufacturing, the fourth resolution is also changing in Industry 5.0 and utilizes high-definition connectivity sensors. Traditional manufacturing companies rely on trusted third parties, which may act as a single point of failure. Access control, big data, and scalability are also challenging issues in existing systems because of the demand response data (DRD) in advanced manufacturing. To mitigate these challenges, CoVAC: A P2P Smart Contract-based Intelligent Smart City Architecture for Vaccine Manufacturing is proposed with three layers, including connection, conversion, and intelligent cloud layer. Smart contract-based blockchain is utilized at the conversion layer for resolving access control, security, and privacy issues. Deep learning is adopted in the intelligent cloud layer for big data analysis and increasing production for vaccine manufacturing in smart city environments. A case study is carried out wherein access data are collected from the various smart plants for vaccines using smart manufacturing to validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. Simulation of the proposed architecture is performed on the collected advanced sensor IoT plants data to address the challenges above, offering scalable production in the vaccine manufacturing for the smart city.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University of Science and Technology, (SeoulTech), Seoul 01811, Republic of Korea."}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Sushil Kumar","initials":"SK","last_name":"Singh"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University of Science and Technology, (SeoulTech), Seoul 01811, Republic of Korea."}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Changhoon","initials":"C","last_name":"Lee"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University of Science and Technology, (SeoulTech), Seoul 01811, Republic of Korea."}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Jong Hyuk","initials":"JH","last_name":"Park"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-01-29T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"107967","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Scalability"},{"name":"Big data"},{"name":"Architecture"},{"name":"Cloud computing"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Smart city"},{"name":"Computer security"},{"name":"Engineering"}],"funding":[{"country":null,"funding_id":null,"org":"National Research Foundation of Korea"}],"issue":null,"keywords":[{"value":"Access control"},{"value":"Blockchain"},{"value":"Deep learning"},{"value":"Security"},{"value":"Smart city"},{"value":"Vaccine manufacturing"}],"lens_id":"104-789-854-277-84X","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"004-022-393-756-784"},{"lens_id":"011-243-463-652-183"},{"lens_id":"011-589-657-304-783"},{"lens_id":"018-620-535-394-60X"},{"lens_id":"022-509-034-520-128"},{"lens_id":"023-519-939-455-012"},{"lens_id":"025-933-995-998-149"},{"lens_id":"031-946-045-099-713"},{"lens_id":"038-695-772-780-266"},{"lens_id":"048-420-146-007-671"},{"lens_id":"050-723-621-039-884"},{"lens_id":"052-096-758-892-758"},{"lens_id":"052-931-135-307-897"},{"lens_id":"061-991-900-106-701"},{"lens_id":"062-834-706-462-611"},{"lens_id":"068-248-869-610-451"},{"lens_id":"085-314-492-915-19X"},{"lens_id":"092-187-469-730-992"},{"lens_id":"107-032-448-808-953"},{"lens_id":"107-742-679-898-876"},{"lens_id":"113-530-773-106-540"},{"lens_id":"137-161-269-053-072"},{"lens_id":"155-778-282-455-140"},{"lens_id":"176-740-600-107-941"}],"scholarly_citations_count":1,"source":{"country":"United Kingdom","issn":[{"type":"unknown","value":"18790550"},{"type":"print","value":"03608352"}],"publisher":"Elsevier Limited","title_full":"Computers & industrial engineering"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"107967","title":"CoVAC: A P2P smart contract-based intelligent smart city architecture for vaccine manufacturing.","volume":"166","year_published":2022},{"abstract":"<jats:p>Information, communication, and energy technologies have the potential to improve engineering education worldwide.

Interfaces to digital twins are projected to go beyond physical representations to become blueprints for the actual “objects” and an active dashboard for their control. The role and importance of real-time interactive animations presented in an Extended Reality (XR) format will be explored. The need for using game engines, particularly their physics engines and AI within interactive simulated Extended Reality is expanded on. Importing and scanning real-world environments is assumed to become more efficient when using AR. Exporting to VR and AR is recommended to be a default feature. A technology framework for the next generation simulators is presented along with a proposed set of implementation guidelines. The need for more human centric technology approaches, nascent in Industry 4.0, are now central to the emerging Industry 5.0 paradigm; an agenda that is discussed in this research as part of a human in the loop future, supported by DES. The potential role of Explainable Artificial Intelligence is also explored along with an audit trail approach to provide a justification of complex and automated decision-making systems with relation to DES. A technology framework is proposed, which brings the above together and can serve as a guide for the next generation of holistic simulators for manufacturing.","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Chris J","initials":"CJ","last_name":"Turner"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Wolfgang","initials":"W","last_name":"Garn"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":null},"end_page":"100354","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Blueprint"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Dashboard"},{"name":"Set (abstract data type)"},{"name":"Systems engineering"},{"name":"Relation (database)"},{"name":"Engineering management"},{"name":"Human–computer interaction"},{"name":"Engineering"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"105-276-493-592-352","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"001-355-528-644-349"},{"lens_id":"002-204-351-572-64X"},{"lens_id":"003-179-703-682-143"},{"lens_id":"003-659-709-722-399"},{"lens_id":"005-560-846-503-793"},{"lens_id":"007-943-326-313-110"},{"lens_id":"008-124-206-643-913"},{"lens_id":"012-958-772-200-290"},{"lens_id":"014-188-774-602-95X"},{"lens_id":"014-356-639-091-333"},{"lens_id":"015-645-845-323-673"},{"lens_id":"017-415-713-662-955"},{"lens_id":"018-822-581-363-834"},{"lens_id":"021-194-441-266-323"},{"lens_id":"022-367-904-225-827"},{"lens_id":"025-153-441-501-113"},{"lens_id":"026-672-252-143-717"},{"lens_id":"027-519-173-335-863"},{"lens_id":"029-914-656-724-778"},{"lens_id":"031-246-319-001-086"},{"lens_id":"032-616-715-302-958"},{"lens_id":"033-070-177-433-014"},{"lens_id":"035-546-565-325-481"},{"lens_id":"044-089-862-763-686"},{"lens_id":"045-936-475-493-242"},{"lens_id":"048-849-788-613-544"},{"lens_id":"049-169-246-735-763"},{"lens_id":"049-289-406-254-077"},{"lens_id":"050-053-538-015-777"},{"lens_id":"054-019-477-630-579"},{"lens_id":"056-985-530-044-66X"},{"lens_id":"057-874-620-604-119"},{"lens_id":"058-402-060-554-395"},{"lens_id":"064-042-765-914-689"},{"lens_id":"071-718-327-513-958"},{"lens_id":"071-860-959-402-137"},{"lens_id":"082-165-078-995-643"},{"lens_id":"083-197-057-555-879"},{"lens_id":"085-912-259-715-810"},{"lens_id":"087-103-284-480-892"},{"lens_id":"087-323-490-534-091"},{"lens_id":"087-463-934-148-429"},{"lens_id":"093-391-963-949-855"},{"lens_id":"100-305-576-140-00X"},{"lens_id":"102-188-784-863-096"},{"lens_id":"103-240-324-065-730"},{"lens_id":"104-963-683-392-202"},{"lens_id":"104-970-888-250-123"},{"lens_id":"113-830-545-572-413"},{"lens_id":"130-076-441-971-473"},{"lens_id":"137-010-626-416-647"},{"lens_id":"139-606-728-531-216"}],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":"Netherlands","issn":[{"type":"print","value":"2452414x"},{"type":"unknown","value":"2467964x"}],"publisher":"Elsevier BV","title_full":"Journal of Industrial Information Integration"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"100354","title":"Next generation DES simulation: A research agenda for human centric manufacturing systems","volume":"28","year_published":2022},{"abstract":"This paper examines the concept of innovation management in the construction industry by studying the major components of the innovation process such as the major drivers of innovation, barriers and obstacles that prevent innovation, the enablers that motivate innovation, the practices of innovation, and the benefits of innovation both at project and company level.

Such systems could lead to a different manufacturing process closer to the current market needs. In addition, the factories can be more efficient, sustainable, and environmentally friendly. This work intends to explore a different approach to the manufacturing process, where there is no production planned behind and the shop floor is a provider of services for the products to be built. For that purpose, this paper proposes an executable model defining the interaction between the different actors and representing the digital counterpart of the CPS. We use a high-level graphical language to create the executable model that allows easy and flexible experimentation with different scenarios. Also, the model can be made as detailed as needed while providing a precise and readable simulation and a resulting detailed log amenable to further analysis.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Polytechnic Institute of Beja, School of Technology and Management,Beja,Portugal"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Nuno","initials":"N","last_name":"Fernandes"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Polytechnic Institute of Beja, School of Technology and Management,Beja,Portugal"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Joao Paulo","initials":"JP","last_name":"Barros"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Polytechnic Institute of Beja, School of Technology and Management,Beja,Portugal"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Rogerio","initials":"R","last_name":"Campos-Rebelo"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-06-01T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":null,"fields_of_study":[{"name":"Executable"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Industry 4.0"},{"name":"Cloud computing"},{"name":"Cyber-physical system"},{"name":"Context (archaeology)"},{"name":"Process (computing)"},{"name":"Production (economics)"},{"name":"Software engineering"},{"name":"The Internet"},{"name":"Work (physics)"},{"name":"Manufacturing engineering"},{"name":"Systems engineering"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"113-280-721-451-159","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"conference proceedings article","references":[{"lens_id":"002-974-268-721-211"},{"lens_id":"023-363-806-263-238"},{"lens_id":"026-493-017-081-372"},{"lens_id":"029-967-429-669-712"},{"lens_id":"030-950-739-222-179"},{"lens_id":"043-392-211-374-500"},{"lens_id":"062-704-150-216-355"},{"lens_id":"071-457-566-846-415"},{"lens_id":"077-660-831-197-084"},{"lens_id":"082-431-493-160-474"},{"lens_id":"095-772-638-454-148"},{"lens_id":"104-963-683-392-202"},{"lens_id":"105-661-127-972-09X"},{"lens_id":"111-666-231-523-104"},{"lens_id":"114-835-602-256-142"}],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[],"publisher":"IEEE","title_full":"2022 IEEE 31st International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":null,"title":"A Graphical and Executable Model for Production Simulation in the Context of Industry 5.0","volume":null,"year_published":2022},{"abstract":"Although manufacturing companies are currently situated at a transition point in what has been called Industry 4.0, a new revolutionary wave—Industry 5.0—is emerging as an ‘Age of Augmentation’ when the human and machine reconcile and work in perfect symbiosis with one another. Recent years have indeed assisted in drawing attention to the human-centric design of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) and to the genesis of the ‘Operator 4.0’, two novel concepts that raise significant ethical questions regarding the impact of technology on workers and society at large. This paper argues that a value-oriented and ethical technology engineering in Industry 5.0 is an urgent and sensitive topic as demonstrated by a survey administered to industry leaders from different companies. The Value Sensitive Design (VSD) approach is proposed as a principled framework to illustrate how technologies enabling human–machine symbiosis in the Factory of the Future can be designed to embody elicited human values and to illustrate actionable steps that engineers and designers can take in their design projects. Use cases based on real solutions and prototypes discuss how a design-for-values approach aids in the investigation and mitigation of ethical issues emerging from the implementation of technological solutions and, hence, support the migration to a symbiotic Factory of the Future.","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Francesco","initials":"F","last_name":"Longo"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Antonio","initials":"A","last_name":"Padovano"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Ethics & Philosophy of Technology"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Steven","initials":"S","last_name":"Umbrello"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2020-06-18T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"25","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Engineering management"},{"name":"Engineering"},{"name":"Situated"},{"name":"Work (electrical)"},{"name":"Value (ethics)"},{"name":"Industry 4.0"},{"name":"Production (economics)"},{"name":"Value sensitive design"},{"name":"Use case"},{"name":"Factory (object-oriented programming)"}],"funding":[],"issue":"12","keywords":[],"lens_id":"113-830-545-572-413","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"000-069-943-339-065"},{"lens_id":"003-098-121-921-779"},{"lens_id":"005-988-234-681-537"},{"lens_id":"015-750-890-950-793"},{"lens_id":"015-896-365-180-470"},{"lens_id":"016-131-629-212-360"},{"lens_id":"018-204-409-632-280"},{"lens_id":"022-001-976-911-088"},{"lens_id":"025-370-045-015-261"},{"lens_id":"030-538-455-823-808"},{"lens_id":"040-192-597-123-492"},{"lens_id":"046-744-066-303-436"},{"lens_id":"047-344-167-153-151"},{"lens_id":"049-816-999-056-296"},{"lens_id":"053-530-162-809-509"},{"lens_id":"058-047-952-980-10X"},{"lens_id":"060-262-622-370-337"},{"lens_id":"065-513-914-579-314"},{"lens_id":"065-934-347-978-866"},{"lens_id":"067-193-950-421-226"},{"lens_id":"071-366-058-731-140"},{"lens_id":"073-439-602-104-579"},{"lens_id":"081-480-253-364-624"},{"lens_id":"085-371-017-012-953"},{"lens_id":"088-362-827-564-703"},{"lens_id":"089-002-311-968-886"},{"lens_id":"090-864-273-291-919"},{"lens_id":"091-910-554-720-952"},{"lens_id":"091-928-035-899-634"},{"lens_id":"097-680-341-242-51X"},{"lens_id":"101-535-958-642-486"},{"lens_id":"104-547-438-104-462"},{"lens_id":"113-262-515-060-959"},{"lens_id":"120-329-562-811-556"},{"lens_id":"125-795-343-058-314"},{"lens_id":"173-954-144-095-944"}],"scholarly_citations_count":78,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"20763417"}],"publisher":"MDPI AG","title_full":"Applied Sciences"},"source_urls":[{"type":"pdf","url":"https://iris.unito.it/bitstream/2318/1741791/1/applsci-10-04182.pdf"},{"type":"html","url":"https://iris.unito.it/handle/2318/1741791"},{"type":"html","url":"https://philpapers.org/rec/LONVAE"},{"type":"html","url":"https://research.tudelft.nl/en/publications/value-oriented-and-ethical-technology-engineering-in-industry-50-"},{"type":"unknown","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/12/4182/pdf"},{"type":"html","url":"https://iris.unical.it/handle/20.500.11770/317633"},{"type":"html","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/12/4182/htm"},{"type":"core_fulltext","url":"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/326909057.pdf"}],"start_page":"1","title":"Value-Oriented and Ethical Technology Engineering in Industry 5.0: A Human-Centric Perspective for the Design of the Factory of the Future","volume":"10","year_published":2020},{"abstract":"<jats:p>The importance of understanding mindsets to direct behavior in internet-based entrepreneurship is the effort in bringing entrepreneurial learning processes close to changes in entrepreneurial behavior.

A deep look at disruptive technology and innovation in retail highlights the diversity of the future of food safety technology. Food systems and food supply chains (FSCs) have undergone significant changes in their operations and structure over the last decade as globalization expands both food choice and availability. As FSCs lengthen, and food passes through extended trading relationships, transparency on food origins, methods of cultivation, harvest, processing as well as labor conditions and sustainability are reduced, along with food trust. Moreover, while the rapid pace of technology innovation benefits FSCs, we are witness to the usage of social media platforms by citizen-consumers to amplify the rhetoric related to recurring incidents and crises in food quality, food safety, food fraud, food security, sustainability, and other ethical lapses. Furthermore, we are witness to new evidence on the global burden of foodborne diseases, including noncommunicable diseases that range from severe malnutrition to morbid obesity and from severe illnesses requiring hospitalization to mortality. The World Health Organization claims that 31 foodborne hazards cause 600 million illnesses and 420,000 deaths annually. Overcoming these challenges requires a holistic reframing of our food systems and societal challenges. The emergence of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provides an overarching framework for collaboration and alignment. Japan has put forward a vision for a human-centric, technology-enabled future branded as “Society 5.0.” Increasingly, the redesign of FSCs necessitates a concerted, multistakeholder effort and the development of digitization strategies in order to cope with the evolution toward the vision of Society 5.0 and to achieve the UN SDGs.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"US"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"111088046"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.189504.1"},{"type":"fundref","value":"100007161"},{"type":"ror","value":"05qwgg493"}],"name":"Boston University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Gennette","initials":"G","last_name":"Zimmer"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2020-07-10T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"42","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Marketing"},{"name":"Food choice"},{"name":"Globalization"},{"name":"Food industry"},{"name":"Food safety"},{"name":"Food security"},{"name":"Sustainable development"},{"name":"Sustainability"},{"name":"Food systems"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"118-456-142-980-433","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"book chapter","references":[],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source_urls":[{"type":"unknown","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128189566000014"}],"start_page":"1","title":"Defining reg tech terms","volume":null,"year_published":2020},{"abstract":"The purpose of this research is to develop a comprehensive evaluation framework of three important elements, namely business, management, and technology embedded in the newly developed Master of Science program in aviation management.

In Society 5.0, a massive amount of data from the sensor will rapidly accumulate in cloud services. It requires enormous bandwidth and high-speed communication than can be achieved by using optical fiber as a transmission media. However, chromatic dispersion will limit the bandwidth and data rate due to pulse broadening, which needs compensation. Among many compensation techniques for optical fiber systems, this research investigates the effects of dispersion compensating fiber (DCF) in a single-mode-fiber (SMF) using a 10 Gbps bit rate at various source power levels. This research considers three different schemes of DCF, i.e., pre-compensation, post-compensation, and symmetrical compensation with NRZ modulation format at transmission distances up to 200 km simulated by using OptiSystem. The results show that the dispersion effect can be compensated by the proposed DCF scheme. Also, the use of amplifiers should be considered to compensate for the high attenuation effect of DCF. The system performance showed that using a three different scheme of DCF could provide a good system performance and reach a transmission distance of 200 km.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"ID"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"29617571"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.9581.5"},{"type":"ror","value":"0116zj450"}],"name":"University of Indonesia"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Nabila Syadzwina","initials":"NS","last_name":"Effendi"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Akademi Telkom Sandhy Putra Jakarta,Telecommunication Engineering Program,Jakarta,Indonesia"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Yus","initials":"Y","last_name":"Natali"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"ID"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"29617571"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.9581.5"},{"type":"ror","value":"0116zj450"}],"name":"University of Indonesia"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Catur","initials":"C","last_name":"Apriono"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2021-07-07T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":null,"fields_of_study":[{"name":"Dispersion (optics)"},{"name":"Single-mode optical fiber"},{"name":"Optical fiber"},{"name":"Electronic engineering"},{"name":"Bandwidth (computing)"},{"name":"Compensation (engineering)"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Transmission medium"},{"name":"Transmission (telecommunications)"},{"name":"Insertion loss"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"121-221-166-893-942","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"conference proceedings article","references":[{"lens_id":"017-851-482-778-854"},{"lens_id":"018-880-086-685-073"},{"lens_id":"019-295-994-749-967"},{"lens_id":"023-987-656-824-751"},{"lens_id":"027-792-232-328-637"},{"lens_id":"030-380-575-036-270"},{"lens_id":"031-246-204-945-642"},{"lens_id":"035-477-564-014-79X"},{"lens_id":"067-339-791-465-465"},{"lens_id":"089-004-015-063-088"},{"lens_id":"095-824-400-963-673"},{"lens_id":"097-153-356-334-607"},{"lens_id":"120-794-564-508-132"}],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[],"publisher":"IEEE","title_full":"2021 International Conference on Green Energy, Computing and Sustainable Technology (GECOST)"},"source_urls":[{"type":"unknown","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=9538764"},{"type":"unknown","url":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9538520/9538628/09538764.pdf?arnumber=9538764"}],"start_page":null,"title":"Study of Dispersion Compensation with Dispersion Compensating Fiber in 10 Gbps Single-Mode Fiber","volume":null,"year_published":2021},{"abstract":"The purpose of this study was to examine the role of innovation competitive advantage on strategic orientation dimensions of (entrepreneurial orientation, market orientation, and resource orientation) on the sustainable growth of SMEs. This study used a total of 217 responses adopting the cross-sectional survey research design from manufacturing SMEs owners/founders. The results were analysed using PLS-SEM via SmartPLS version 3.3.3. The major findings established that entrepreneurial orientation did not directly link with the sustainable growth of SMEs. The study confirmed that market orientation and resource orientation revealed a direct and significant positive link with the sustainable growth of SMEs. Similarly, innovation competitive advantage has a direct significant positive association with the sustainable growth of SMEs. Likewise, entrepreneurial orientation and market orientation have a direct and significant positive relationship with innovation competitive advantage. However, resource orientation did not significantly relate to innovation competitive advantage. The findings validated that innovation competitive advantage mediated the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation, market orientation, and the sustainable growth of SMEs. Finally, innovation competitive advantage did not mediate between resource orientation and sustainable growth of SMEs, which have not previously been proven in empirical studies. This study was designed to address the existing gaps and provide reasons to prove them. This study is indeed one of the remarkable studies in the context of SMEs, which integrates these selected variables into a single model. The originality focused on the role of innovation competitive advantage on strategic orientation dimensions and sustainable growth of SMEs that are relevant to Society

servitisation and the related field of product-service systems that has emerged independently from different fields including engineering, management, design and environmental studies. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a structured literature review to explore, identify and synthesise the multi-disciplinary research challenges in the journey towards servitisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDesign/methodology/approach\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe research approach is a systematic literature review using key word searches and citation tracking for research reported between 1990 and 2013 in research databases that cover the fields which have generated the body of knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFindings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the key findings from the extant literature on servitisation is that it suffers from three fundamental weaknesses. First, numerous studies are conceptual in nature with limited practicality. Second, there are relatively few empirical studies, and often the findings relate to a single case study based on the insights of a limited number of senior managers. Third, often the dynamics are insufficiently studied in these organisations because data for most cases are collected post-event.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResearch limitations/implications\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the literature review and its shortfalls, this paper proposes a holistic framework of eight themes that require further attention from academic researchers in order that a more complete conceptual understanding of servitisation is developed to support practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPractical implications\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEach theme in the framework has an associated list of questions that can be addressed through research and presented to managers as a challenge agenda to improve their servitisation efforts. That servitisation is associated with differentiation and competitive advantage makes this a valuable approach for managing corporate performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginality/value\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResearch from multi-disciplinary sources is synergised in order to develop an overarching servitisation agenda that transcends domain-based boundaries. This paves the way for an approach to servitisation that is coherent and harmonious.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"GB"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"11983389"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.25627.34"},{"type":"ror","value":"02hstj355"}],"name":"Manchester

and digital intelligence era, the innovation resources and innovation environment that manufacturing enterprises rely on have shown exponential growth. Digital green innovation (DGI) has gradually become the mainstream paradigm of innovation. How to achieve a balance between a local DGI network (LDGIN) and a remote DGI network (RDGIN) and how to use the role of digital empowerment and green organization flexibility to improve the performance of DGI are very important issues facing manufacturing enterprises at present. However, this problem has not been fully addressed in the existing research. In this study, the influence mechanism of LDGIN and RDGIN on the DGI performance of manufacturing enterprises was revealed, considering the moderating role of digital empowerment and green organization flexibility. The linear regression method was used to analyze the 562 valid data obtained by questionnaire survey. The results of this study are as follows. The effect of the DGI network on manufacturing enterprises’ DGI performance is heterogeneous because of LDGIN and RDGIN. The establishment of embedded links in a DGI network inevitably requires manufacturing enterprises to pay the corresponding costs. The over-embedding of manufacturing enterprises into RDGIN will have a negative impact on DGI performance. The balance between LDGIN and RDGIN has an important impact on manufacturing enterprises’ operation. The comprehensive balance and relative balance indexes constructed in this paper show that an appropriate balance can promote the improvement of the DGI performance of manufacturing enterprises. Digital transformation and organizational structure innovation are changing the business model of manufacturing enterprises and can regulate the relationship between the LDGIN and RDGIN and the DGI performance of manufacturing enterprises. The balance of DGI network embedding in practice shows the important role and enlightening significance of local and remote search in developing countries.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"CN"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I151727225"},{"type":"ror","value":"03x80pn82"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.33764.35"}],"name":"Harbin Engineering University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Chengli","initials":"C","last_name":"Hu"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Hongtao","initials":"H","last_name":"Yang"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Shi","initials":"S","last_name":"Yin"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-07-05T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"97","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Flexibility (engineering)"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Industrial organization"},{"name":"Manufacturing"},{"name":"Digital transformation"},{"name":"Balance (ability)"},{"name":"Process management"},{"name":"Operations management"},{"name":"Computer science"}],"funding":[],"issue":"4","keywords":[],"lens_id":"123-745-968-235-511","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"000-905-205-541-553"},{"lens_id":"001-998-899-553-736"},{"lens_id":"002-675-386-476-536"},{"lens_id":"003-079-085-633-847"},{"lens_id":"006-208-215-788-351"},{"lens_id":"007-876-983-918-032"},{"lens_id":"009-065-722-352-740"},{"lens_id":"009-121-014-555-057"},{"lens_id":"012-377-342-003-136"},{"lens_id":"012-836-919-511-187"},{"lens_id":"013-044-191-813-561"},{"lens_id":"013-752-033-907-797"},{"lens_id":"015-628-088-610-602"},{"lens_id":"016-320-267-172-324"},{"lens_id":"016-595-734-832-25X"},{"lens_id":"017-747-964-995-413"},{"lens_id":"018-557-923-448-236"},{"lens_id":"020-490-193-487-45X"},{"lens_id":"021-843-543-155-568"},{"lens_id":"021-870-293-444-335"},{"lens_id":"021-993-970-323-208"},{"lens_id":"022-053-613-750-865"},{"lens_id":"024-229-385-077-195"},{"lens_id":"024-233-361-244-86X"},{"lens_id":"024-513-049-354-50X"},{"lens_id":"025-606-063-549-02X"},{"lens_id":"025-614-564-772-051"},{"lens_id":"025-920-132-689-575"},{"lens_id":"026-861-169-641-750"},{"lens_id":"028-248-497-041-049"},{"lens_id":"028-942-189-455-610"},{"lens_id":"029-074-671-542-148"},{"lens_id":"030-101-051-833-426"},{"lens_id":"034-496-467-458-505"},{"lens_id":"034-617-094-108-737"},{"lens_id":"035-466-391-061-171"},{"lens_id":"037-207-588-109-673"},{"lens_id":"039-024-640-828-300"},{"lens_id":"041-689-645-906-978"},{"lens_id":"042-886-903-959-052"},{"lens_id":"044-765-909-900-408"},{"lens_id":"045-592-491-973-16X"},{"lens_id":"047-851-862-670-675"},{"lens_id":"051-906-996-843-324"},{"lens_id":"051-969-797-133-31X"},{"lens_id":"052-230-732-286-834"},{"lens_id":"057-845-219-652-066"},{"lens_id":"058-108-144-684-00X"},{"lens_id":"059-115-149-350-078"},{"lens_id":"060-530-272-312-118"},{"lens_id":"064-277-795-970-530"},{"lens_id":"072-180-038-418-30X"},{"lens_id":"072-339-930-820-086"},{"lens_id":"073-053-229-980-025"},{"lens_id":"074-654-255-187-127"},{"lens_id":"076-723-973-008-305"},{"lens_id":"080-023-771-764-820"},{"lens_id":"081-366-195-602-129"},{"lens_id":"086-764-418-688-886"},{"lens_id":"086-936-540-313-752"},{"lens_id":"087-690-399-614-159"},{"lens_id":"087-873-725-055-498"},{"lens_id":"088-268-841-136-819"},{"lens_id":"094-275-122-264-980"},{"lens_id":"094-936-615-846-124"},{"lens_id":"098-941-243-510-970"},{"lens_id":"101-362-936-249-875"},{"lens_id":"101-892-923-066-269"},{"lens_id":"102-077-220-210-493"},{"lens_id":"103-263-291-368-971"},{"lens_id":"103-283-428-251-546"},{"lens_id":"104-294-026-807-580"},{"lens_id":"112-074-051-269-556"},{"lens_id":"117-316-045-696-341"},{"lens_id":"133-722-662-751-530"},{"lens_id":"142-366-944-206-176"},{"lens_id":"157-644-507-299-695"},{"lens_id":"159-230-690-402-381"},{"lens_id":"166-295-681-583-169"},{"lens_id":"170-694-723-712-460"},{"lens_id":"171-564-090-961-053"},{"lens_id":"171-802-905-729-337"},{"lens_id":"172-510-878-345-451"},{"lens_id":"198-832-570-152-835"},{"lens_id":"199-243-720-910-859"},{"lens_id":"199-297-378-932-350"},{"lens_id":"199-999-351-308-968"}],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"unknown","value":"20798954"}],"publisher":"MDPI AG","title_full":"Systems"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"97","title":"Insight into the Balancing Effect of a Digital Green Innovation (DGI) Network to Improve the Performance of DGI for Industry 5.0: Roles of Digital Empowerment and Green Organization Flexibility","volume":"10","year_published":2022},{"abstract":"Developing technologies, advancement in science, evolving globalized perspectives and the massive dependence on digital platform for a routine sustenance has led to the core building of Industry 4.0. In general, industry 4.0 focuses on the metamorphosis of all industrial components with the help of strong digital support. It's very often interlinked with the successful fourth industrial revolution. It is to be noted that the very fourth outburst of industrialization plunges forward in order to achieve an optimized and sustained form of production. With the uplift of the fourth generation of this stirring revolution, the efficient extraction of advanced informatics analytics along with internetworked machines have grown to a great extent, complementing the digital platform. On the other hand, society 5.0 involves a human centric community which is capable of striking a balance between the economical proliferations and resolving societal liabilities by the core combination of cyber and physical space. Just like how industry 4.0 carries out the digital transformation of every industrial perspective, society 5.0 encourages mundane life to leap towards a digital revamp expanding across different tiers of the community. Indeed, the rapid change of information and Communication Technology along with the portrayal of society 5.0 as a global trend and a key aspect of the Science and Technology Basic plan, the interplay of the two proves to be a constant support for each other. This paper discusses about the future look of industry 4.0 and society 5.0 and elaborates on the challenges and opportunities rooted from them.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"IN"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"876193797"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.412813.d"},{"type":"ror","value":"00qzypv28"}],"name":"VIT University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Meghna Manoj","initials":"MM","last_name":"Nair"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"IN"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"876193797"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.412813.d"},{"type":"ror","value":"00qzypv28"}],"name":"VIT University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Amit Kumar","initials":"AK","last_name":"Tyagi"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"107049736"}],"name":"Pondicherry Engineering College"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"N.","initials":"N","last_name":"Sreenath"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2021-01-27T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":null,"fields_of_study":[{"name":"Engineering management"},{"name":"Digital transformation"},{"name":"Sustenance"},{"name":"Industry 4.0"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Industrialisation"},{"name":"Industrial Revolution"},{"name":"Plan (drawing)"},{"name":"Information and Communications Technology"},{"name":"Analytics"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"126-042-692-951-426","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"conference proceedings article","references":[{"lens_id":"007-893-540-948-00X"},{"lens_id":"015-008-734-610-504"},{"lens_id":"016-960-237-498-599"},{"lens_id":"019-763-285-018-963"},{"lens_id":"020-555-574-954-829"},{"lens_id":"027-192-978-746-115"},{"lens_id":"033-333-885-606-168"},{"lens_id":"062-757-415-379-846"},{"lens_id":"064-042-765-914-689"},{"lens_id":"072-329-848-195-489"},{"lens_id":"086-885-197-186-655"},{"lens_id":"088-865-245-126-222"},{"lens_id":"100-137-794-930-923"},{"lens_id":"102-424-326-687-39X"},{"lens_id":"104-963-683-392-202"},{"lens_id":"105-049-891-404-994"},{"lens_id":"107-308-686-388-40X"},{"lens_id":"113-767-551-070-365"},{"lens_id":"170-563-722-411-658"}],"scholarly_citations_count":17,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[],"publisher":"IEEE","title_full":"2021 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics (ICCCI)"},"source_urls":[{"type":"unknown","url":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9402219/9402221/09402498.pdf?arnumber=9402498"},{"type":"unknown","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=9402498"}],"start_page":null,"title":"The Future with Industry 4.0 at the Core of Society 5.0: Open Issues, Future Opportunities and Challenges","volume":null,"year_published":2021},{"abstract":"<jats:p>The construction industry’s inherent fragmentation fuels Construction Supply Chain (CSC) complexity. Logistics form an essential part of the CSC in terms of costs and project management. In turn, transportation accounts for more than half the logistics costs due to construction materials being low-cost/high-volume, and most other logistics processes being business processes and not physical ones. Construction transport is almost entirely road bound, one of the least sustainable modes with externalities far out of proportion to its numbers. Ergo, its optimisation presents substantial greening (de-carbonisation) opportunity, with potentially far-reaching sustainability impacts. The ASI (Avoid-Shift-Improve) concept considers activity, modal structure, and energy intensity/efficiency as transport carbon components, providing a fundamental optimisation framework. 93% of New Zealand’s freight (a third of it construction related) is road bound, with 99% fossil-fuel (diesel) dependence.

How shared economy can perform a superlative role in augmenting the corporate sustainable performance is another interesting gap that needs to be unveiled. This study investigates the linkage between shared economy practices and corporate triple bottom line (TBL) in three core streams—environmental performance (ENVP), social performance (SP), and economic performance (EP)—using empirical data. An additional factor of industry 5.0 (i5.0) technologies was treated as a moderator between shared economy and TBL. The findings assured the positive nexus of shared economy (i.e., contract manufacturing services, professional services, data entry &amp; clerical services, creative and multimedia services, sales and marketing services, software development services, and writing or translation services) on TBL (i.e., ENVP, SP, and EP). The positive moderating influence of i5.0 technologies was further affirmed between the relationships of shared economy and TBL. The findings yield multidimensional insights for operational management to adopt shared economy and i5.0 practices to improve corporate TBL in today’s competitive era. In addition, this study accentuates the notion of shared economy by providing positive evidence from developing nations.

To this end, we combine a detailed firm-level econometric analysis of 399,356 firms with a macroeconomic input-output model to estimate flood impacts on China’s manufacturing sector over the period 2003–2010. We find that large flooding events on average reduce firm outputs (measured by labor productivity) by about 28.3% per year. Using an input-output analysis, we estimate the potential macroeconomic impact to be a 12.3% annual loss in total output, which amounts to 15,416 RMB billion. Impacts can propagate from manufacturing firms, which are the focus of our empirical analysis, through to other economic sectors that may not actually be located in floodplains but can still be affected by economic disruptions. Lagged flood effects over the following two years are estimated to be a further 5.4% at the firm level and their associated potential effects are at a 2.3% loss in total output or 2,486 RMB billion at the macro-level. These results indicate that the scale of economic impacts from flooding is much larger than microanalyses of direct damage indicate, thus justifying greater action, at a policy level and by individual firms, to manage flood risk.","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Xi","initials":"X","last_name":"Hu"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Raghav","initials":"R","last_name":"Pant"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Jim W.","initials":"JW","last_name":"Hall"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Swenja","initials":"S","last_name":"Surminski"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Jiashun","initials":"J","last_name":"Huang"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2019-04-01T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":null,"fields_of_study":[{"name":"Empirical research"},{"name":"Economic sector"},{"name":"Floodplain"},{"name":"Economics"},{"name":"Natural resource economics"},{"name":"Flooding (psychology)"},{"name":"Economic impact analysis"},{"name":"Productivity"},{"name":"Scale (social sciences)"},{"name":"Flood myth"}],"funding":[{"country":null,"funding_id":null,"org":"St. Antony's College, University of Oxford"},{"country":null,"funding_id":null,"org":"European Commission"},{"country":null,"funding_id":null,"org":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"},{"country":null,"funding_id":null,"org":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"}],"issue":"7","keywords":[],"lens_id":"128-419-307-357-552","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"002-199-418-778-455"},{"lens_id":"002-232-213-447-881"},{"lens_id":"003-777-742-922-525"},{"lens_id":"004-110-527-848-001"},{"lens_id":"006-262-118-172-667"},{"lens_id":"008-128-467-093-858"},{"lens_id":"014-538-173-799-934"},{"lens_id":"014-633-411-314-61X"},{"lens_id":"015-118-897-816-141"},{"lens_id":"017-564-088-930-334"},{"lens_id":"018-884-205-039-540"},{"lens_id":"022-306-112-266-760"},{"lens_id":"031-580-347-742-774"},{"lens_id":"032-307-520-377-432"},{"lens_id":"035-998-338-159-45X"},{"lens_id":"036-259-536-096-856"},{"lens_id":"037-310-947-988-821"},{"lens_id":"038-196-787-346-28X"},{"lens_id":"038-950-551-709-760"},{"lens_id":"043-488-731-053-870"},{"lens_id":"044-009-867-458-063"},{"lens_id":"044-893-017-201-376"},{"lens_id":"048-125-002-973-844"},{"lens_id":"049-633-165-420-619"},{"lens_id":"057-302-574-206-57X"},{"lens_id":"057-952-755-304-253"},{"lens_id":"067-092-963-652-696"},{"lens_id":"067-529-002-697-026"},{"lens_id":"072-901-026-059-01X"},{"lens_id":"073-497-874-542-56X"},{"lens_id":"075-442-434-893-061"},{"lens_id":"087-463-945-415-254"},{"lens_id":"089-649-460-325-849"},{"lens_id":"096-427-271-664-462"},{"lens_id":"104-728-694-241-530"},{"lens_id":"144-472-182-448-516"},{"lens_id":"145-581-989-589-706"},{"lens_id":"160-507-931-573-080"},{"lens_id":"169-113-246-589-944"}],"scholarly_citations_count":8,"source":{"country":"Switzerland","issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"20711050"}],"publisher":"MDPI AG","title_full":"Sustainability"},"source_urls":[{"type":"html","url":"https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/100534/"},{"type":"html","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/7/1933"},{"type":"html","url":"https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jsusta/v11y2019i7p1933-d218995.html"},{"type":"unknown","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/7/1933/pdf"},{"type":"core_fulltext","url":"https://core.ac.uk/download/196515473.pdf"}],"start_page":"1933","title":"Multi-Scale Assessment of the Economic Impacts of Flooding: Evidence from Firm to Macro-Level Analysis in the Chinese Manufacturing Sector","volume":"11","year_published":2019},{"abstract":"Visible Light Communication (VLC) is a short-range optical wireless communication technology that has been gaining attention due to its potential to offload heavy data traffic from the congested radio wireless spectrum. At the same time, wireless communications are becoming crucial to smart manufacturing within the scope of Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 is a developing trend of high-speed data exchange in automation for manufacturing technologies and is referred to as the fourth industrial revolution. This trend requires fast, reliable, low-latency, and cost-effective data transmissions with fast synchronizations to ensure smooth operations for various processes. VLC is capable of providing reliable, low-latency, and secure connections that do not penetrate walls and is immune to electromagnetic interference. As such, this paper aims to show the potential of VLC for industrial wireless applications by examining the latest research work in VLC systems. This work also highlights and classifies challenges that might arise with the applicability of VLC and visible light positioning (VLP) systems in these settings. Given the previous work performed in these areas, and the major ongoing experimental projects looking into the use of VLC systems for industrial applications, the use of VLC and VLP systems for industrial applications shows promising potential.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"GB"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"11983389"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.25627.34"},{"type":"ror","value":"02hstj355"}],"name":"Manchester

socio-cultural processes on the formation of industrial areas within the borders of modern Russia and partially the Russian Empire and the USSR. Basically, the evolutionary approach is used in the version of cyclic genetic dynamics. To assess the long-term effects of the “path dependence”, we analyze the 150-year cycle of industrialization within the borders of Historical Russia. To do this, we use the mechanisms of spatial localization of Kondratiev cycles and associated technological structures of the first (first-second), second (third-fourth)) and the third (fifth) industrial revolution. As an information base, data on the number of people employed and the volume of industrial production (in comparable prices) are used, and for the XX century, data on the dynamics of fixed assets of industry are also used. The relationship between modernization schemes on the old basis (within the boundaries of old industrial areas) and in the areas of pioneer development is revealed. The stability of industry specializations within the grid of industrial areas is considered separately. Based on the results obtained, the conclusion is made about the stability of old industrial cores of localization of industrial potential, the continuity of the spectrum of their specializations (not the replacement of old industries with new ones, but the addition). There is also a repetition in the regions of the new development of the General scheme of the chosen path and the inherited track.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"RU"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"19880235"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.14476.30"},{"type":"wikidata","value":"q13164"},{"type":"ror","value":"010pmpe69"}],"name":"Moscow State University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"V.L.","initials":"VL","last_name":"Baburin"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":null},"end_page":"39","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Economics"},{"name":"Economic geography"},{"name":"Production (economics)"},{"name":"Path dependence"}],"funding":[],"issue":"3","keywords":[],"lens_id":"128-820-381-240-011","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"021-121-543-879-270"},{"lens_id":"053-380-318-319-565"},{"lens_id":"054-915-064-259-180"},{"lens_id":"057-091-449-818-019"},{"lens_id":"058-477-259-753-451"},{"lens_id":"080-699-713-713-777"},{"lens_id":"128-758-293-802-470"},{"lens_id":"138-668-634-380-370"}],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"print","value":"19945280"}],"publisher":"Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University","title_full":"Regional nye issledovaniya"},"source_urls":[{"type":"unknown","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5922/1994-5280-2020-3-3"}],"start_page":"26","title":"Path dependence and evolution of Russia’s territorial production systems","volume":null,"year_published":2020},{"abstract":"<jats:p>Science has become a center of knowledge that has contributed greatly to the development of technology. Almost all technology developed and created comes from research carried out on an ongoing basis and using a scientific approach. Science learning is currently developing and adapting to the needs of the times. The development of science occurs by utilizing collaboration with other branches of science such as technology, mechanical engineering, and mathematics. The distinctive feature of collaboration that has become an important value in IR 4.0 also occurs in the field of education. Big Data, as the hallmark of Society 5.0, is the source of big data that makes education more effective and efficient. In addition, the use of Education Technology (EdTech) can also support collaborative transportation and use of data. MEXT (2018) makes a leading project as a form of planning and compilation of science learning towards Society 5.0 through 3 important and essential steps, including: providing diverse opportunities and learning spaces to achieve “fair, individually optimized learning”, ensuring that all students acquire basic academic abilities such as basic reading skills, mathematical thinking, and information literacy skills, are not involved in the humanity or knowledge gap. The success of science learning can be supported by several branches of science such as Physics, Computer science, Natural science, Mathematics and modeling, Teaching and learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, STEM-based classroom management, Robotic and game teaching in science education, Instructional technology and application in science education, Training and professional development for STEM teachers, STEM curriculum in science education, Computer-based learning, Learning Innovations and Evaluation, Design and implementation of a technology-rich learning environment, Distance learning on education.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Therefore, I thank all participants for International Conference on Science Education and Technology (ICOSETH 2019) who have contributed their research to develop Science education to face Industrial Revolution 4.0 and Society 5.0.

In 1988, the term Lean emerged and this philosophy successfully challenged the mass production implemented in the automotive industry, focused on customers’ requirements and satisfaction with the minimum use of resources and waste elimination. A Lean environment can be a promoter in the implementation of the fourth industrial revolution, named Industry 4.0 (I4.0). In the succession of Industry 4.0 emerged the Society 5.0 in Japan, as a strategy to deal with the impact of an ageing population. The focus of this quiet revolution is the humankind and the creation of conditions to promote a happy, motivated and satisfied society with more time for leisure and consequently increase productivity and wealth. This article presents a historical approach to the technological evolution of productive systems, and their influence on societies.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"PT"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"161321875"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.7427.6"},{"type":"fundref","value":"100007691"},{"type":"ror","value":"03nf36p02"}],"name":"University of Beira Interior"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Andreia G.","initials":"AG","last_name":"Pereira"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"PT"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"161321875"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.7427.6"},{"type":"fundref","value":"100007691"},{"type":"ror","value":"03nf36p02"}],"name":"University of Beira Interior"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Tânia M.","initials":"TM","last_name":"Lima"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"PT"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"161321875"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.7427.6"},{"type":"fundref","value":"100007691"},{"type":"ror","value":"03nf36p02"}],"name":"University of Beira Interior"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Fernando","initials":"F","last_name":"Charrua-Santos"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2019-07-25T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"705","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Technological evolution"},{"name":"Lean manufacturing"},{"name":"Population ageing"},{"name":"Economics"},{"name":"Productivity"},{"name":"Industry 4.0"},{"name":"Production (economics)"},{"name":"Industrial Revolution"},{"name":"Automotive industry"},{"name":"Economic system"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"133-203-328-367-192","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"book","references":[{"lens_id":"001-662-801-314-886"},{"lens_id":"002-083-325-980-449"},{"lens_id":"012-218-887-216-344"},{"lens_id":"015-008-734-610-504"},{"lens_id":"033-541-372-628-755"},{"lens_id":"041-437-717-635-476"},{"lens_id":"049-682-867-290-960"},{"lens_id":"081-144-427-432-971"},{"lens_id":"098-420-446-653-572"},{"lens_id":"103-577-139-953-377"},{"lens_id":"118-401-703-686-43X"},{"lens_id":"122-638-018-540-686"},{"lens_id":"138-270-464-467-114"},{"lens_id":"138-410-670-980-586"}],"scholarly_citations_count":4,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"print","value":"21945357"},{"type":"electronic","value":"21945365"}],"publisher":"Springer International Publishing","title_full":"Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing"},"source_urls":[{"type":"html","url":"https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ihiet/ihiet2019.html#PereiraLC19"},{"type":null,"url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-25629-6_109.pdf"},{"type":"html","url":"https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-25629-6_109"},{"type":"html","url":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-25629-6_109"}],"start_page":"700","title":"IHIET - Society 5.0 as a Result of the Technological Evolution: Historical Approach","volume":null,"year_published":2019},{"abstract":"The strong current of globalization has driven the rapid development of the digital era and technology so that the term digital citizenship has emerged. The emergence of Society 5.0 era demands a balance between technology and the environment. But on the other hand, the emergence of the Society 5.0 era was not matched by the formation of digital ethics in society. The rise of cybercrime cases such as the spread of fake news (hoaxes), hate speech, and cyberbullying shows the lack of digital ethics in society. The formation of digital ethics is an important thing that must be done, one of which is through digital citizenship education in society. The method used in this research is qualitative with a case study approach. Data collection was carried out through observation and in-depth interviews with several main sources, namely the community board of Kampung Cyber and community members based on purposive sampling and snowball sampling techniques. The results showed that the emergence of the Kampung Cyber community became the main forum for the implementation of digital citizenship education in society, especially in shaping ethics. The application of norms in society becomes the main control for any deviant actions in the use of technology. It takes the development of competencies and digital ethical values that are in accordance with the era of Society 5.0, such as technological literacy, responsibility, honesty, critical thinking, problem solving, creativity, equality and local wisdom. The existence of a key figure as a model in social learning will shape people's behavior according to digital ethical competencies in the era of Society 5.0. In addition, it is necessary to create a good environment and strong ties in society that will encourage the successful formation of ideal and ethical digital citizenship in the era of Society 5.0.","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Endang","initials":"E","last_name":"Wulandari"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":null,"initials":null,"last_name":"Winarno"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":null,"initials":null,"last_name":"Triyanto"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":null},"end_page":"956","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Nonprobability sampling"},{"name":"Snowball sampling"},{"name":"Sociology"},{"name":"Globalization"},{"name":"Ideal (ethics)"},{"name":"Honesty"},{"name":"Cybercrime"},{"name":"Public relations"},{"name":"Social learning"},{"name":"Information ethics"}],"funding":[],"issue":"5","keywords":[],"lens_id":"133-643-866-461-353","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"print","value":"23323205"},{"type":"electronic","value":"23323213"}],"publisher":"Horizon Research Publishing Co., Ltd.","title_full":"Universal Journal of Educational Research"},"source_urls":[{"type":"html","url":"https://www.hrpub.org/journals/article_info.php?aid=10847"}],"start_page":"948","title":"Digital Citizenship Education: Shaping Digital Ethics in Society 5.0","volume":"9","year_published":2021},{"abstract":"This article focuses on the conceptual study of the blended learning model. This article also presents several studies from the online journal article and the findings of previous research from thesis and dissertations and textbooks relating to the theory of blended learning. As an effort to reformulate PAI learning, it is important to implement blended learning in the current digital era. Islamic religious education has a material source that is extensive and strategic for the progress of the Indonesian nation. With most Indonesia's population is the follower of Islam, Islamic religious education as millennial generation literacy is appropriate to be formulated under the development of digital technology. Islamic education can take a strategic role as the immunization of the young generation amidst the advancement of learning and innovation. Blended learning is one of them in future learning. Blended learning is one of the latest learning models that has been successfully applied to educational institutions. This study describes blended learning as an effort to reformulate PAI learning in the digital era 4.0. This study also aims to be a reference for further research. This research was conducted with the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method of various research findings and the findings of journal articles relating to the blended learning. The findings of the study showed that the principle of blended learning synergize a balanced combination between face-to-face and online learning. It can apply blended learning to PAI learning and is quite successful. Using technology will strengthen the conventional methods that commonly occur in PAI learning so that PAI learning is more effective and efficient. Some research states that blended learning has motivated students in learning, enables students to be more creative, more active, more participatory, more communicative, independent and able to solve problems in learning, improving learning outcomes. We can conclude it that the results regarding blended learning are having a positive impact on student development and also on learning outcomes.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Islamic State Institute of Samarinda (IAIN Samarinda)"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Agus","initials":"A","last_name":"Setiawan"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2019-12-01T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"129","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Mathematics education"},{"name":"Psychology"},{"name":"Blended learning"},{"name":"Systematic review"},{"name":"Religious education"},{"name":"Citizen journalism"},{"name":"Action (philosophy)"},{"name":"Population"},{"name":"Islam"},{"name":"Literacy"}],"funding":[],"issue":"2","keywords":[],"lens_id":"135-015-105-776-17X","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[],"scholarly_citations_count":1,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"24770027"},{"type":"print","value":"23391332"}],"publisher":"IAIN Samarinda","title_full":"SYAMIL: Jurnal Pendidikan Agama Islam (Journal of Islamic Education)"},"source_urls":[{"type":"pdf","url":"https://journal.iain-samarinda.ac.id/index.php/syamil/article/download/1827/pdf"},{"type":"html","url":"https://journal.iain-samarinda.ac.id/index.php/syamil/article/view/1827"},{"type":"html","url":"https://journal.uinsi.ac.id/index.php/syamil/article/view/1827"},{"type":"core_fulltext","url":"https://core.ac.uk/download/287357696.pdf"}],"start_page":"119","title":"Conceptual of Blended Learning as Islamic Education Study Program Learning Reform Action in Digital Era 4.0","volume":"7","year_published":2019},{"abstract":"The future of industry 4.0 which is called industry 5.0 is the crossroads between information technology and operational technology, converging on physical and virtual systems that were previously used separately in industrial manufacturing processes with a focus of western culture. In other words, the supply chain uses technology to create integration between people, processes, and products. SMEs owners, manufacturers, and service organizations can access unprecedented, new levels of data, which can make it easy to understand, control, and improve every aspect of their operations. In the present study, existing research work on the models and assessment readiness criteria for the adoption of industry 4.0 are over-viewed. In I4.0, hybrid organizations are a type of organizations that have two wings of social and environmental mission and economic wing. The business models of these organizations have blurred the line between for-profit and non-profit organizations so that hybrid organizations can fall into both for-profit / non-profit categories. Hybrid Entrepreneurs Seek Organizational Organizations and Markets to Address Specific Social and Environmental Issues. The characteristics of these organizations are creating value for healthy living, environmental and social justice, environmental sustainability, quality products and services. In this paper we did research the development of a readiness assessment framework for tomorrow’s SMEs/hybrid SMEs or SME 5.0 which are small medium sized enterprises for getting prepared for the future concern for adopting the educational components of future of I4.0.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"University of Applied Sciences (FHM),Department of Business and

As per the 2014 report of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, life in urban areas is linked with higher levels of literacy and education, improved health, lesser fertility rates, and enhanced life expectancy with a greater access to social environment. Hence, increased movement of population is taking place from rural to urban areas. But this movement is increasingly leading to the creation of peri-urban areas around major cities with underdeveloped infrastructural facilities and compromised health and sanitation services.

With the aim to identify the digital footprint of Industry 4.0 in the current manufacturing ecosystem, a systematic literature survey of surveys is conducted here, based on survey academic articles that cover the current state-of-the-art. The 59 selected high-impact survey manuscripts are analysed using PRISMA principles and categorized according to their technologies under analysis and impact, providing valuable insights for the research and business community. Specifically, the influence Industry 4.0 exerts on traditional business models, small and medium-sized enterprises, decision-making processes, human–machine interaction, and circularity affairs are investigated and brought out, while research gaps, business opportunities, and their relevance to Industry 5.0 principles are pointed out.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"GR"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I147962203"},{"type":"ror","value":"03bfqnx40"},{"type":"wikidata","value":"q1121584"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.12284.3d"}],"name":"Democritus University of Thrace"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Fotios K.","initials":"FK","last_name":"Konstantinidis"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Nikolaos","initials":"N","last_name":"Myrillas"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Spyridon G.","initials":"SG","last_name":"Mouroutsos"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Dimitrios","initials":"D","last_name":"Koulouriotis"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Antonios","initials":"A","last_name":"Gasteratos"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-08-29T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"746","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Relevance (law)"},{"name":"Variety (cybernetics)"},{"name":"Systematic review"},{"name":"Industry 4.0"},{"name":"Manufacturing"},{"name":"Business model"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Knowledge management"},{"name":"Marketing"}],"funding":[{"country":null,"funding_id":null,"org":"European Commission"}],"issue":"9","keywords":[],"lens_id":"141-896-729-341-625","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"001-265-134-592-321"},{"lens_id":"003-913-088-984-839"},{"lens_id":"004-145-919-596-763"},{"lens_id":"004-475-276-116-659"},{"lens_id":"006-076-495-214-915"},{"lens_id":"006-617-002-106-561"},{"lens_id":"006-848-615-858-449"},{"lens_id":"009-219-509-047-252"},{"lens_id":"009-681-033-139-791"},{"lens_id":"010-191-791-723-448"},{"lens_id":"011-259-223-852-350"},{"lens_id":"011-298-009-144-582"},{"lens_id":"012-313-055-301-920"},{"lens_id":"013-287-665-466-861"},{"lens_id":"014-356-639-091-333"},{"lens_id":"014-934-290-898-725"},{"lens_id":"016-948-561-963-366"},{"lens_id":"019-026-189-807-460"},{"lens_id":"020-581-472-422-02X"},{"lens_id":"022-396-341-133-891"},{"lens_id":"025-016-433-045-559"},{"lens_id":"025-111-295-042-100"},{"lens_id":"028-528-278-772-219"},{"lens_id":"029-984-749-194-685"},{"lens_id":"030-219-829-832-189"},{"lens_id":"032-446-197-585-556"},{"lens_id":"033-541-372-628-755"},{"lens_id":"033-891-588-686-065"},{"lens_id":"038-904-037-813-023"},{"lens_id":"040-089-897-542-861"},{"lens_id":"042-151-874-988-008"},{"lens_id":"042-503-108-899-432"},{"lens_id":"043-211-916-651-410"},{"lens_id":"044-976-542-021-772"},{"lens_id":"046-446-925-840-307"},{"lens_id":"046-731-395-529-820"},{"lens_id":"047-188-377-878-829"},{"lens_id":"050-815-540-538-129"},{"lens_id":"052-178-343-401-717"},{"lens_id":"054-538-253-062-474"},{"lens_id":"058-129-365-032-761"},{"lens_id":"058-584-841-214-713"},{"lens_id":"059-327-547-420-726"},{"lens_id":"062-384-740-672-078"},{"lens_id":"063-316-150-808-125"},{"lens_id":"064-911-828-088-495"},{"lens_id":"068-356-244-846-913"},{"lens_id":"070-047-008-873-090"},{"lens_id":"074-473-632-503-437"},{"lens_id":"078-105-153-032-072"},{"lens_id":"078-697-180-365-720"},{"lens_id":"084-249-962-919-116"},{"lens_id":"088-424-854-659-039"},{"lens_id":"089-230-166-614-452"},{"lens_id":"090-218-470-242-562"},{"lens_id":"091-833-989-269-586"},{"lens_id":"099-993-498-730-415"},{"lens_id":"100-118-205-098-996"},{"lens_id":"105-672-868-849-631"},{"lens_id":"106-214-017-971-530"},{"lens_id":"109-152-233-288-638"},{"lens_id":"110-006-925-937-299"},{"lens_id":"111-197-312-287-538"},{"lens_id":"113-786-738-207-126"},{"lens_id":"113-811-562-357-842"},{"lens_id":"114-855-635-376-990"},{"lens_id":"115-442-497-162-193"},{"lens_id":"120-929-073-793-931"},{"lens_id":"124-707-104-600-736"},{"lens_id":"127-443-614-736-396"},{"lens_id":"129-475-105-628-804"},{"lens_id":"129-946-196-716-663"},{"lens_id":"134-477-067-632-705"},{"lens_id":"135-553-141-898-826"},{"lens_id":"144-790-711-872-00X"},{"lens_id":"146-473-356-444-943"},{"lens_id":"147-205-562-995-709"},{"lens_id":"150-142-202-641-838"},{"lens_id":"170-831-297-351-794"},{"lens_id":"184-899-754-144-889"},{"lens_id":"188-711-839-991-014"},{"lens_id":"188-771-360-176-100"}],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"unknown","value":"20751702"}],"publisher":"MDPI AG","title_full":"Machines"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"746","title":"Assessment of Industry 4.0 for Modern Manufacturing Ecosystem: A Systematic Survey of Surveys","volume":"10","year_published":2022},{"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Managing a sustainable supply chain is a concept related to many areas of the economy. Its efficient functioning depends on the implementation of SDG activities and the development of industry (first-fourth/fifth industrial revolution). Due to the likelihood of different priorities in the implementation of the sustainable development goals, it is important to build such relationships, e.g. in the supply chain, so that their implementation could take place under similar conditions. Digitization, or the circular economy concept (CE), create an opportunity for the SME sector to build relationships as part of industry networks, for instance, where the managed supply chain would have a common and realistic goal to achieve. This goal will be a priority in business models based on sustainable development. The article presents the results of research regarding the furniture industry in Poland (key industry, referred to as smart specialization). The results of the analysis show that the industry has a large production potential, and the natural resources used in it are constantly increasing. However, there are doubts raised by the lack of stability in the dynamics of the sold production in the industry. Ultimately, the business model of the industry supply chain should focus on the environmental aspect (sustainable management of the raw material supply chain) and on eco-friendly consumption (sustainable management of the product supply chain), so that it can be managed in a sustainable way.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"PL"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"130294970"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.34197.38"},{"type":"ror","value":"046awyn59"}],"name":"Częstochowa University of Technology"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Anna","initials":"A","last_name":"Wiśniewska-Sałek"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2021-06-24T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"234","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Environmental economics"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Industry 4.0"},{"name":"Sustainable supply chain"},{"name":"Statistical analysis"},{"name":"Furniture industry"},{"name":"Natural resource"},{"name":"Sustainable development"},{"name":"Sustainability"}],"funding":[],"issue":"3","keywords":[],"lens_id":"145-176-133-242-925","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"004-354-593-478-345"},{"lens_id":"011-053-116-114-295"},{"lens_id":"013-044-719-719-355"},{"lens_id":"018-402-956-890-614"},{"lens_id":"020-171-452-840-951"},{"lens_id":"021-315-943-430-048"},{"lens_id":"029-347-882-391-037"},{"lens_id":"041-227-869-131-490"},{"lens_id":"042-704-326-369-30X"},{"lens_id":"044-054-748-132-469"},{"lens_id":"044-968-660-415-369"},{"lens_id":"053-262-593-876-369"},{"lens_id":"060-973-085-586-626"},{"lens_id":"063-795-614-122-262"},{"lens_id":"070-621-486-013-363"},{"lens_id":"075-771-045-127-838"},{"lens_id":"081-648-774-299-190"},{"lens_id":"082-963-215-399-060"},{"lens_id":"083-685-083-819-498"},{"lens_id":"100-890-534-337-672"},{"lens_id":"101-444-577-009-739"},{"lens_id":"103-277-511-768-123"},{"lens_id":"106-645-111-629-04X"},{"lens_id":"112-538-540-416-089"},{"lens_id":"147-795-555-777-175"},{"lens_id":"148-482-715-509-006"},{"lens_id":"199-441-316-870-311"}],"scholarly_citations_count":3,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"24505781"}],"publisher":"Walter de Gruyter GmbH","title_full":"Management Systems in Production Engineering"},"source_urls":[{"type":"html","url":"https://sciendo.com/article/10.2478/mspe-2021-0028"},{"type":"html","url":"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MSPE...29..227W/abstract"},{"type":"pdf","url":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/mspe-2021-0028"},{"type":"html","url":"https://bazekon.uek.krakow.pl/rekord/171624158"}],"start_page":"227","title":"Managing a Sustainable Supply Chain – Statistical Analysis of Natural Resources in the Furniture Industry","volume":"29","year_published":2021},{"abstract":"The swings of global trade in recent decades have been resulted from the global economic crisis and unfavorable condition of global situation. Deterioration of private demand -- as a result of economic crisis and increase of unemployment – has been the main reason of worsening global trade. This condition has, of course, affected economic performance of countries through trade channels. Furthermore, the recent trade agenda following to Trump administration has created another uncertainty to the world economy. This paper studies the impact of new trade agenda, which is represented by Trump’s plan on trade policy, to the world economy as well as to Indonesian and Japanese economy in particular. The analysis is based on computable general equilibrium of GTAP model version 6, with two scenarios: (i) Trump Trade Agenda when implementing 45 and 35 percent tariff to China and Mexico; (ii) Trade Hit List when imposing tariff to the 16 countries in the trade hit list. Impacts of both scenarios are examined in short run and long run. The results suggest that both scenarios in the short run will not create any significant effect to global economy as whole nor to Indonesian and Japan in particular. However, their impacts to the global economy, Indonesia, and Japan will be substantial in the long run. Therefore, Indonesia and Japan in particular should concern on providing sound economic policies to reduce the risk of new trade agenda to these economies in the long run. Some policy recommendation provided in this paper are: (i) Japan should focus on improving technological innovation to realize the implementation of society 5.0 and industry 4.0 as scheduled; (ii) Indonesia should facilitate more investment to its economy and provide more government investment to induce accumulation of capital stock in the future. Furthermore, efficiencies and technological adoption should also be main concern of the Indonesian government to induce productivity of the economy and help mitigate the global risks in the long run.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"AU"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"165779595"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.1008.9"},{"type":"fundref","value":"501100001782"},{"type":"ror","value":"01ej9dk98"}],"name":"University of Melbourne"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Amalia Adininggar","initials":"AA","last_name":"Widyasanti"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2017-10-31T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"202","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Commercial policy"},{"name":"Economics"},{"name":"Trade barrier"},{"name":"International economics"},{"name":"Short run"},{"name":"Computable general equilibrium"},{"name":"World economy"},{"name":"Foreign direct investment"},{"name":"Free trade"},{"name":"Economic integration"}],"funding":[],"issue":"2","keywords":[],"lens_id":"146-117-974-697-162","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"019-646-269-458-632"},{"lens_id":"075-316-510-480-748"}],"scholarly_citations_count":1,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"24609196"},{"type":"print","value":"14108046"}],"publisher":"Bank Indonesia, Central Banking Research Department","title_full":"Buletin Ekonomi Moneter dan Perbankan"},"source_urls":[{"type":"pdf","url":"https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/download/8825.pdf"},{"type":"html","url":"https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/res_display.asp?RecordID=5435"},{"type":"unknown","url":"http://www.journalbankindonesia.org/index.php/BEMP/article/view/811"},{"type":"core_fulltext","url":"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/234039028.pdf"}],"start_page":"181","title":"THE IMPACT OF NEW TRADE AGENDA TO MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF INDONESIA AND JAPAN IN SHORT AND LONG TERM","volume":"20","year_published":2017},{"abstract":"The world is heading in the wrong direction on carbon emissions where we are not on track to limit global warming to 1.5 °C; Ireland is among the countries where overall emissions have continued to rise. The development of wettable peatland products and services (termed 'Paludiculture') present significant opportunities for enabling a transition away from peat-harvesting (fossil fuels) to developing 'green' eco-innovations. However, this must be balanced with sustainable carbon sequestration and environmental protection. This complex transition from 'brown to green' must be met in real time by enabling digital technologies across the full value chain. This will potentially necessitate creation of new green-business models with the potential to support disruptive innovation. This timely paper describes digital transformation of paludiculture-based eco-innovation that will potentially lead to a paradigm shift towards using smart digital technologies to address efficiency of products and services along with future-proofing for climate change. Digital transform of paludiculture also aligns with the 'Industry 5.0 - a human-centric solution'. However, companies supporting peatland innovation may lack necessary standards, data-sharing or capabilities that can also affect viable business model propositions that can jeopardize economic, political and social sustainability. Digital solutions may reduce costs, increase productivity, improve produce develop, and achieve faster time to market for paludiculture. Digitisation also enables information systems to be open, interoperable, and user-friendly. This constitutes the first study to describe the digital transformation of paludiculture, both vertically and horizontally, in order to inform sustainability that includes process automation via AI, machine learning, IoT-Cloud informed sensors and robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and blockchain for cyber-physical systems. Thus, the aim of this paper is to describe the applicability of digital transformation to actualize the benefits and opportunities of paludiculture activities and enterprises in the Irish midlands with a global orientation.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Bioscience Research Institute, Technological University of the Shannon Midlands Midwest (TUS), Dublin Road, Athlone, Ireland; Empower Eco™ Sustainable Hub, Technological University of the Shannon Midlands Midwest (TUS), Dublin Road, Athlone, Ireland.

In fact, Industry 5.0 focuses on research and innovation to support industrial production sustainability and place the well-being of industrial workers at the center of the production process. Thus, Industry 5.0 relies on three pillars: it is human-centric, it encourages sustainability and it is aimed at developing resilience against disruptions. Such core aspects cannot be fully achieved without a transparent end-to-end human-centered traceability throughout the value chain. As a consequence, Auto-Identification (Auto-ID) technologies play a key role, since they are able to provide automated item recognition, positioning and tracking without human intervention or in cooperation with industrial operators. Although the most popular Auto-ID technologies provide a certain degree of security and productivity, there are still open challenges for future Industry 5.0 factories. This article analyzes and evaluates the Auto-ID landscape and delivers a holistic perspective and understanding of the most popular and the latest technologies, looking for solutions that cope with harsh, diverse and complex industrial scenarios. In addition, it describes a methodology for selecting Auto-ID technologies for Industry 5.0 factories. Such a methodology is applied to a specific use case of the shipbuilding industry that requires identifying the main components of a ship during its construction and repair. To validate the outcomes of the methodology, a practical evaluation of passive and active UHF RFID tags was performed in an Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV) under construction, showing that a careful selection and evaluation of the tags enables product identification and tracking even in areas with a very high density of metallic objects. As a result, this article serves as a useful guide for industrial stakeholders, including future developers and managers that seek for deploying identification and traceability technologies in Industry 5.0 scenarios.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Department of Computer Engineering, Centro de Investigación CITIC, Universidade da Coruña, A Coruña, Spain"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Paula","initials":"P","last_name":"Fraga-Lamas"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Navantia S.

Students are more likely to be introduced to the basic concepts of ethnoscience without involving how to integrate ethnoscience into science learning. The impact is that students’ scientific literacy is low. This is what underlies researchers to apply the Local Wisdom Integrated Science (LWIS) learning model by using local Madurese content to train students’ scientific literacy. The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in student scientific literacy after implementing the LWIS learning model in ethnoscience learning with local Madurese content. The method used was pre-experimental study with one group pretest-posttest design. When the study was carried out in the even semester of the 2019/2020 academic year by taking 22 students via purposive sampling technique as a sample of all students in class 6A of science education, Trunojoyo University, Madura. Analysis of data using descriptive statistics and paired sample t test. The results showed that there were different in the scientific literacy of the students using the LWIS learning model before and after studying ethnoscience with local Madurese material. The entire LWIS syntax helps train students' scientific literacy by including self-awareness of the importance of local Madurese content as a learning context. Ethnoscience can be integrated into science learning through the STEAM approach. The contribution of STEAM to the LWIS learning model and self-awareness is very significant in developing ethnoscience learning for local Madurese content from elementary, middle, and tertiary level.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Natural Science Education, Faculty of Education, University of Trunojoyo Madura"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Mochammad","initials":"M","last_name":"Yasir"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Natural Science Education, Faculty of Education, University of Trunojoyo Madura"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Ana Yuniasti Retno","initials":"AYR","last_name":"Wulandari"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2020-10-31T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"112","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Nonprobability sampling"},{"name":"Mathematics education"},{"name":"Psychology"},{"name":"Class (computer programming)"},{"name":"Ethnoscience"},{"name":"Context (language use)"},{"name":"Descriptive statistics"},{"name":"Science education"},{"name":"Literacy"},{"name":"Scientific literacy"}],"funding":[],"issue":"2","keywords":[],"lens_id":"154-529-730-132-174","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"25277634"},{"type":"print","value":"24072311"}],"publisher":"University of Trunojoyo Madura","title_full":"Jurnal Pena Sains"},"source_urls":[{"type":"html","url":"https://journal.trunojoyo.ac.id/penasains/article/view/8445"},{"type":"pdf","url":"https://journal.trunojoyo.ac.id/penasains/article/download/8445/LWIS%20Model"},{"type":"core_fulltext","url":"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/348690269.pdf"}],"start_page":"103","title":"TEACHING MADURA LOCAL CONTENT LITERACY ON PRESERVICE SCIENCE TEACHER USING LWIS MODEL","volume":"7","year_published":2020},{"abstract":null,"authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Teboho","initials":"T","last_name":"Pitso"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2020-01-29T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":null,"fields_of_study":[{"name":"Futures contract"},{"name":"Value (mathematics)"},{"name":"Ingenuity"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Knowledge management"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"156-416-711-330-572","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"book chapter","references":[{"lens_id":"004-432-110-208-094"},{"lens_id":"014-493-002-986-202"},{"lens_id":"018-569-712-107-333"},{"lens_id":"030-122-499-949-956"},{"lens_id":"048-397-670-215-60X"},{"lens_id":"059-486-587-181-588"},{"lens_id":"062-914-390-830-990"},{"lens_id":"072-631-605-511-720"},{"lens_id":"099-846-649-486-174"},{"lens_id":"103-970-100-130-577"},{"lens_id":"124-976-822-248-330"},{"lens_id":"143-837-771-803-750"},{"lens_id":"163-875-593-302-349"}],"scholarly_citations_count":1,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[],"publisher":"IntechOpen","title_full":"Toward Super-Creativity -

The inclusion of human interaction with digital realities, extended reality (XR) technologies, such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), can play an essential role in Industry 5.0. While rapid advances in XR technologies are solidifying and finding their place in the product and production development process, terminology and classification scheme remain under-determined. As a result, there have been numerous classifications of XR technologies from different perspectives, but little widespread agreement. They have been classified by their level of immersion or how well they meet a specific purpose (such as training). In addition to that, the classifications are usually made for one particular field (e.g. marketing, healthcare, engineering, architecture, among others). Therefore, to set the basis for future research, it is essential to identify and outline the dimensions that intervene in product and production design in regards to XR facilitated collaboration. With the ideas proposed in this paper, we want to identify basic concepts that classify a collaborative XR system by analyzing how users interact with the environment and other users. Our motivation is that collaborative design involves not only the physical dimension but also a social dimension. Defining when an XR system contributes to increasing social and/or physical presence could clarify and simplify its categorization.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"School of Engineering Science, University of Skövde, Skövde, Sweden"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Francisco","initials":"F","last_name":"Garcia Rivera"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"School of Engineering Science, University of Skövde, Skövde, Sweden"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Maurice","initials":"M","last_name":"Lamb"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"School of Engineering Science, University of Skövde, Skövde, Sweden"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Dan","initials":"D","last_name":"Högberg"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"School of Engineering Science, University of Skövde, Skövde, Sweden"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Anna","initials":"A","last_name":"Brolin"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-04-20T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":null,"fields_of_study":[{"name":"Terminology"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Product design"},{"name":"Product (mathematics)"},{"name":"Knowledge management"},{"name":"Human–computer interaction"},{"name":"Categorization"},{"name":"Data science"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"158-037-442-638-546","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"book chapter","references":[],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"unknown","value":"2352751x"},{"type":"unknown","value":"23527528"}],"publisher":"IOS Press","title_full":"Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":null,"title":"The Schematization of XR Technologies in the Context of Collaborative Design","volume":null,"year_published":2022},{"abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic has hampered the economy of the entire world. One of the deeply affected units was the apparel industry, which was worth almost 1.4 trillion U.S dollars. With social distancing, panic and fear in the minds of everyone, it became apparent that digitization brought about by Industry 4.0, is the new normal. The evolution of all the five Industrial Revolutions is discussed in this paper. It also highlights how the apparel industry has incorporated emergent technologies of Industry 4.0 like Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, 3D-Printing, Cloud computing and Data Analytics in its manufacturing and marketing units. The impact of the pandemic has made the stakeholders of all businesses to halt, ponder and progress towards a new horizon for sustainability. The challenges of Industry 4.0, how and why the transition of the apparel industry from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 took place is highlighted in this paper.

One of the main reasons is the increased number of variables, parameters, and interrelations on the shop floor. This intrinsic complexity can grow exponentially when considering the manufacture of large-size products with high levels of variability and variants: the mass production of large recreational motorboats with high levels of customization and low production volumes, mass customization. With the increasing role of sustainability and concepts of Industry 5.0, focusing not just on improving production systems but also human wellbeing, quick decision making becomes essential. Data and digitalization are becoming the cornerstone for system improvement, and digital data availability and analysis can facilitate the utilization of computerized tools to support decision making and maximize the performance of complex systems. For that purpose, simulation can be a powerful analytical tool to design, maintain, and improve complex manufacturing systems. Simulation techniques usually allow handling the size and complexity commonly associated with manufacturing systems. However, in systems with highly customized and large-size products, manual processes, and limited floor space, the implementation of simulation techniques is not straightforward, especially considering the aspects of variability, data collection, model validation, and system reconfiguration. With a particular focus on large-size products and limitations of a constrained existing facility layout, this paper presents the implementation of a simulation-based reconfiguration assessment considering manual production, assembly, and internal logistics requirements. Going through an industrial case study of large recreational motorboats manufacturing, the paper analyses the system analysis, data collection, implementation, and validation of the methodology step by step. Considering different what-if scenarios, the focus is on the capacity reconfiguration using Discrete-Event Simulation. The results can serve as a guideline for decision-makers and stakeholders working with complex mass customization manufacturing systems and space-constrained facility layouts.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Department of Mechanical Engineering and Science, Kyoto University, Kyoto, 615-8540, Japan"},{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"School of Engineering Science, University of Skövde.

Indonesian citizens share the suffering of the disaster and their experience through the news. However, Indonesian media reports the news of forest fire in a different way related to their respective media agendas and the adoption of Industry 5.0 cultures. The study of news construction of mass media on forest fires is crucial because it relates to government policymaking. This research aims to determine the media agenda in constructing forest fires that occur in Indonesia related to the development of Industry 5.0. It applies a mixed-method of qualitative content analysis of published news during October 2019-January 2020 and newsroom ethnography of three national online news media. Media agenda-setting factors observed in univariate analysis are news focus, news sources, forest fire-prevention, the impact of a forest fire, and the event of a forest fire. This paper is a working paper and has not yet concluded the results because it needs further investigation on newsroom ethnography.

To maintain production and adjust quickly to technological transformation, innovative work-based learning approaches are emphasized. Intelligent machines are becoming capable of interaction and collaboration with humans. They not only introduce a new type of learnable workforce to manufacturing but may open opportunities to enhance learning of all learners. Symbiotic relationships of humans and machines have wide potential for human-centric manufacturing (aka Industry 5.0). Moreover, connecting smart devices and deploying self-learning solutions is envisioned to increase flexibility of manufacturing, thus changing work division between humans and machines. Where humans and machines collaborate, the term Reciprocal Learning has been coined to describe the process of bidirectional learning. While a definition of Reciprocal Learning exists the boundary conditions of the concept are still ambiguous. In this paper, a framework for Reciprocal Learning in Human-Machine Collaboration for Industry 5.0 is presented to clarify what it is and what it isn’t. The approach is based on a multi-agent system perspective, comprising human and machine agents.

As research methods, analysis and synthesis of current world trends were applied, as well as special methods were used: expert assessments of international organizations were analyzed, a comparative and economic-statistical analysis was carried out. As a result, the distinctive features of Industry 5.0 are highlighted – this is the coexistence of industry and new social and environmental trends and needs. Change is inevitable: green energy and sustainable products will initially be a monopoly factor and benefit insiders. It is emphasized that in order to achieve global competitiveness, companies need to transform established business models and invest in technology and network forms of business, taking into account social goals: in addition to creating new jobs and ensuring flexible employment, we are talking about personalization of goods and greening. The poli¬tical and economic goals of the fifth industrial revolution and the direction of technological innovations are considered. It is emphasized that technology, according to the new approach, should serve people and society, which means that the technology used in production adapts to the needs and diversity of industry workers. The leaders are artificial intelligence, quantum information and semiconductors. Technological transformation is based on the development of the following areas: individual technologies for human-machine interaction, biotechnology and smart materials, artificial intelligence, digital twins, data transmission, storage and analysis technologies, as well as energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, storage and autonomy. It is an ecosystem-based innovation policy with a flexible focus on results. It is noted that technological transformation will help solve a number of unique social problems. It puts a bold focus from individual technologies to a system approach that allows the industry to achieve social goals beyond job creation and growth, and puts the well-being of industry workers at the center of the production process. In conclusion, the techno-social nature of the fifth revolution is revealed, with technology as tools and social needs as the ultimate goal.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Elena A.","initials":"EA","last_name":"Avdeeva"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Tatiana A.","initials":"TA","last_name":"Averina"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Natalya A.","initials":"NA","last_name":"Balashova"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":null},"end_page":"147","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Industrial organization"},{"name":"Technological revolution"},{"name":"Diversity (politics)"},{"name":"Digital transformation"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Technological change"},{"name":"Order (exchange)"},{"name":"Sustainable development"},{"name":"Competitive advantage"},{"name":"Big data"},{"name":"Economics"},{"name":"Marketing"}],"funding":[],"issue":"2","keywords":[],"lens_id":"161-693-041-457-991","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"print","value":"1991976x"},{"type":"electronic","value":"24096571"}],"publisher":"FSAEIHE South Ural State University (National Research University)","title_full":"Bulletin of the South Ural State University.

The framework is designed with six core components, namely spatial data, metadata, standards, electronic clearinghouse, communication network and application specific module. Three-tier thin client server web GIS architecture is adopted for imparting geospatial web capabilities to OpenSDI4Health using QGIS, GeoServer, Apache Tomcat, PostgreSQL/ PostGIS, uDig Java Script, CSS and HTML. Hospital site selection, a typical ill-structured decision-making problem involving multiple criteria and stakeholders, is selected as application module for Prayagraj city of India. For this purpose, web-based Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) with three core components, i.e., database, model base and user interface, is developed. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique, is used for developing the spatial model for criteria selection, criteria weighting and spatial modelling under GIS environment. Open SDI for Health Sector, OpenSDI4Health, is non-proprietary solution powered with interoperability and security features which enables the sharing across different technologies, data, platforms and organizations, thereby providing reliability as well as reusability of the developed framework for other sectors also, like education, for empowering the planners and administrators to make informed decisions leading to the improvement in the efficacy of developmental process.KeywordsWeb GISSpatial Data Infrastructure (SDI)HealthOpen Source Geospatial Resources (OSGR)InteroperableNational Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)Hospital site selectionMulti Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)Client server architectureAnalytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Standards","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"IN"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I152869788"},{"type":"ror","value":"04dp7tp96"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.419983.e"}],"name":"Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Rajan Dev","initials":"RD","last_name":"Gupta"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"IN"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I152869788"},{"type":"ror","value":"04dp7tp96"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.419983.e"}],"name":"Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Sonam","initials":"S","last_name":"Agrawal"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":null}],"name":"Department of Computing Science and Engineering, United University, Prayagraj, India"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Ashutosh Kumar","initials":"AK","last_name":"Tripathi"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-03-11T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"303","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Spatial data infrastructure"},{"name":"Geospatial analysis"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Analytic hierarchy process"},{"name":"Interoperability"},{"name":"Spatial database"},{"name":"Multiple-criteria decision analysis"},{"name":"Database"},{"name":"Process management"},{"name":"Knowledge management"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"162-587-371-020-255","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"book chapter","references":[{"lens_id":"007-295-931-988-367"},{"lens_id":"009-881-393-198-900"},{"lens_id":"011-083-410-259-687"},{"lens_id":"023-638-509-880-90X"},{"lens_id":"027-914-291-760-019"},{"lens_id":"036-784-682-767-502"},{"lens_id":"059-992-212-549-157"},{"lens_id":"090-103-019-389-48X"},{"lens_id":"110-087-545-162-687"},{"lens_id":"188-589-469-717-897"}],"scholarly_citations_count":1,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"unknown","value":"27309061"},{"type":"unknown","value":"2730907x"}],"publisher":"Springer Singapore","title_full":"Disruptive Technologies and Digital Transformations for Society 5.0"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"273","title":"NSDI Based Innovative Approach for Development of Open Source SDI for Health Sector: A Way Forward","volume":null,"year_published":2022},{"abstract":"<jats:p>The last 20 years have brought significant developments to digital fabrication technology, known as additive manufacturing (3D printing), and it has finally started to shed its prototyping mantel in favor of an industrial one.

To enlighten the transition from Industry 4.0 to Society 5.0, and from Engineering Education 4.0 to Engineering Education 5.0, project-based learning (PBL) methodologies should also evolve. In terms of focus and topics selected for the PBL experiences, it is necessary to put forward the relevance of global challenges and to nurture a compromise for sustainability and ethical behaviour, while bringing students as close as possible to real multifaceted engineering problems. As regards connections with other educational methodologies, PBL and service learning (SL) are bound to hybridization and may benefit from innovative approaches, like the use of flipped classrooms, the promotion of gamification or the support of online resources and e-/b-/m-learning tools and methods. Complete PBL experiences will also synergize with and contribute to open-source engineering movements, like the “makers” movement, and will benefit from open software and hardware tools for increased educational equity. This chapter analyses and discusses trends in PBL methodologies, in connection with these new industrial and educational paradigms.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Andrés","initials":"A","last_name":"Díaz Lantada"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-04-20T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":null,"fields_of_study":[{"name":"Transformative learning"},{"name":"Project-based learning"},{"name":"Engineering education"},{"name":"Service-learning"},{"name":"Engineering ethics"},{"name":"Promotion (chess)"},{"name":"Engineering"},{"name":"Equity (law)"},{"name":"Nature versus nurture"},{"name":"Compromise"},{"name":"Engineering management"},{"name":"Computer science"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"165-333-210-935-760","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"book chapter","references":[{"lens_id":"125-795-343-058-314"},{"lens_id":"136-036-567-993-098"}],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[],"publisher":"IntechOpen","title_full":"Insights Into Global Engineering Education After the Birth of Industry 5.0"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":null,"title":"Engineering Education 5.0: Strategies for a Successful Transformative Project-Based Learning","volume":null,"year_published":2022},{"abstract":"Over time, industrial revolutions have marked human existence and the work environment, impacting efficiency, effectiveness, and productivity. In the new promoted concept, Industry 5.0, it is expected that humans interact with robots, known as cobots, in a collaborative working space using innovative technologies. This chapter brings some new insights on the way the components of Industry 5.0 readiness model influence value added reported by countries, for the period between 2017 and 2019, on four levels of analysis, namely: (i) country gross value added; (ii) environmental activities value added; (iii) ICT sector value added; (iv) labour productivity. Our results prove that selected components of the Industry 5.0 readiness model determine a positive marginal effect on the value added reported by countries. We also registered a significant influence on the development of the circular economy, in strong relation with the development of the knowledge economy. This highlights the fact that the results of the research are efficiently implemented on manufacturing operations by highly skilled employees, leading to increase firms’ performance, improving at the same time the cooperation between humans and smart machines, as stated in the Industry 5.0 framework.KeywordsHuman-centric approachSustainable developmentIndustry 5.0Economic assessmentResilienceFactor analysisReadiness IndexEnvironmental value addedLabour productivity","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"RO"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I3121153395"},{"type":"ror","value":"0583a0t97"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.14004.31"}],"name":"West University of Timişoara"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Aura","initials":"A","last_name":"Domil"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"RO"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I3121153395"},{"type":"ror","value":"0583a0t97"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.14004.31"}],"name":"West University of Timişoara"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Valentin","initials":"V","last_name":"Burca"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"RO"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I3121153395"},{"type":"ror","value":"0583a0t97"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.14004.31"}],"name":"West University of Timişoara"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Oana","initials":"O","last_name":"Bogdan"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"256","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Productivity"},{"name":"Value (mathematics)"},{"name":"Industrial organization"},{"name":"Added value"},{"name":"Index (typography)"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Work (physics)"},{"name":"Perspective (graphical)"},{"name":"Industry 4.0"},{"name":"Economics"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"165-524-924-084-242","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"book chapter","references":[{"lens_id":"001-395-188-545-307"},{"lens_id":"002-398-645-119-451"},{"lens_id":"005-609-792-919-05X"},{"lens_id":"007-997-484-072-926"},{"lens_id":"010-191-791-723-448"},{"lens_id":"017-415-713-662-955"},{"lens_id":"017-690-014-022-445"},{"lens_id":"022-364-586-886-756"},{"lens_id":"024-845-525-387-208"},{"lens_id":"030-885-939-483-658"},{"lens_id":"031-827-047-258-990"},{"lens_id":"034-191-620-199-646"},{"lens_id":"044-257-323-155-323"},{"lens_id":"044-976-542-021-772"},{"lens_id":"049-816-999-056-296"},{"lens_id":"065-776-376-781-367"},{"lens_id":"067-715-932-083-994"},{"lens_id":"071-973-445-852-166"},{"lens_id":"079-330-047-262-55X"},{"lens_id":"080-645-998-976-111"},{"lens_id":"100-124-216-391-558"},{"lens_id":"102-024-085-249-950"},{"lens_id":"103-000-517-608-073"},{"lens_id":"103-127-499-232-604"},{"lens_id":"106-174-712-124-858"},{"lens_id":"140-933-913-297-672"},{"lens_id":"146-346-698-365-266"},{"lens_id":"151-367-882-448-620"},{"lens_id":"152-325-633-965-046"},{"lens_id":"153-133-342-515-563"}],"scholarly_citations_count":2,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"unknown","value":"26626829"},{"type":"unknown","value":"26626837"}],"publisher":"Springer Singapore","title_full":"Advances in Sustainability Science and Technology"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"233","title":"Assessment of Economic Impact Generated by Industry 5.0, from a Readiness Index Approach Perspective.

Secondly, online surveys and in-depth interviews were administered to understand the current status of IM development and future development goals. Finally, case studies were conducted to demonstrate whether the hypothesis of the development approach is feasible.,This study finds that the overall maturity level of the local valve industry is still in the planning stage since the local valve industry lacks concentration and is relatively scattered. In addition, the feasible development approach is dependent on smart devices to improve production efficiency, ensure quality management and effectively control costs.,The research is conducted and focused on the Yangtze River Delta region instead of the whole country, and the size of the sample is small. Therefore, there may be some characteristics omitted in the analysis.,Manufacturers can upgrade to smart manufacturing through intelligent software platforms in order to complete an automatic interaction of data and devices. In addition, manufacturers should complete cross-regional collaborative development through the industrial Internet of things.,There is little or none of research work completed for the development strategy of the valve industry internationally. Therefore, research findings of this area can provide a fundamental understanding of China's local valve industry and contribute to the existing knowledge.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Centre for Digital Innovation"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Victor","initials":"V","last_name":"Chang"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"CN"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"69356397"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.440701.6"},{"type":"ror","value":"03zmrmn05"}],"name":"Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Yuanyuan Kate","initials":"YK","last_name":"Xu"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"CN"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"69356397"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.440701.6"},{"type":"ror","value":"03zmrmn05"}],"name":"Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Jingqi","initials":"J","last_name":"Zhang"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"CN"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"69356397"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.440701.6"},{"type":"ror","value":"03zmrmn05"}],"name":"Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Qianwen","initials":"Q","last_name":"Xu"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2020-06-05T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"321","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Work (electrical)"},{"name":"Order (exchange)"},{"name":"Process management"},{"name":"Market environment"},{"name":"Control (management)"},{"name":"Macro analysis"},{"name":"Maturity (finance)"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)"},{"name":"Quality management"}],"funding":[],"issue":"2","keywords":[],"lens_id":"167-100-641-058-873","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"004-161-433-299-128"},{"lens_id":"011-032-772-593-084"},{"lens_id":"045-703-989-714-690"},{"lens_id":"073-514-244-039-451"},{"lens_id":"079-263-975-074-765"},{"lens_id":"094-019-771-819-795"},{"lens_id":"102-424-326-687-39X"},{"lens_id":"151-852-906-653-119"}],"scholarly_citations_count":5,"source":{"country":"United Kingdom","issn":[{"type":"print","value":"20466099"},{"type":"electronic","value":"20466102"}],"publisher":"Emerald","title_full":"Smart and Sustainable Built Environment"},"source_urls":[{"type":"html","url":"https://research.tees.ac.uk/en/publications/research-on-intelligent-manufacturing-development-approach-for-ch"},{"type":"html","url":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/SASBE-02-2020-0014/full/html"},{"type":"core_fulltext","url":"https://core.ac.uk/download/323991373.pdf"}],"start_page":"293","title":"Research on intelligent manufacturing development approach for China's local valve industry","volume":"10","year_published":2020},{"abstract":"AbstractIndustry 4.0 refers to the transformation of industry through the adoption of techniques and processes based on information and communication technologies (ICT) to manage and optimize all aspects of the manufacturing processes and supply chain.

We live in an era of artificial intelligence–driven as well as viral disruptions that challenge the mind as well as the body. At the same time, the impact of our pursuit of prosperity at any cost on the environment triggers displaced people floods and viral pandemics undermining the standard of living and more importantly the foundations of trust in institutions and in a better tomorrow feeding populist movements and autocratic trends in democracies as well as emboldening dictators. This work discusses the concepts of Risk Management 5.0, Industry 4.0, Industry 5.0, Society 5.0, Digital Transformation, Blockchain, and the role of AI via the Internet of Things architectures that could enable “smarter as well as more humane solutions to our challenges.”","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"US"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"193531525"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.253615.6"},{"type":"fundref","value":"100007108"},{"type":"ror","value":"00y4zzh67"}],"name":"George

Quadruple and Quintuple Helix Innovation Systems, it is essential to realize that the Quadruple and Quintuple Helices are based on democracy and ecology. This has two implications: (1) the further advancement and evolution of knowledge and innovation are requiring a co-evolution with democracy or knowledge democracy, and (2) ecology, ecological sensitivity, and environmental protection are a necessity for the survival of humanity, but they should also be regarded as drivers for further knowledge production and innovation development. This implies that for an innovation system to be a Quadruple and Quintuple Helix Innovation System, the government and the political system, addressing the innovation system, must be democratic in substance, and not only in form. This indicates how a Quadruple and Quintuple Helix differs from Triple Helix approaches to innovation. Furthermore, within the framework of Quadruple and Quintuple Helix, the “Democracy of Climate” for innovation and the “Democracy of Knowledge” are combined together in creating a nexus. Implications for strategy, policy, and practice are manifold, also incorporating aspects of Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0.","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"US"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"193531525"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.253615.6"},{"type":"fundref","value":"100007108"},{"type":"ror","value":"00y4zzh67"}],"name":"George Washington University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Elias G.","initials":"EG","last_name":"Carayannis"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"AT"}],"ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"132976966"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.15462.34"},{"type":"ror","value":"03ef4a036"}],"name":"Danube University Krems"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"David F.

forward under technology upgrades, utilizing information technology to improve the intelligence of the industry, whereas Industry 5.0 is value-driven, aiming to focus on essential societal needs, values, and responsibility. The manufacturing industry is currently moving towards the integration of productivity enhancements and sustainable human employment. Such a transformation has deeply changed the human–machine interaction (HMI), among which digital twin (DT) and extended reality (XR) are two cutting-edge technologies. A manufacturing DT offers an opportunity to simulate, monitor, and optimize the machine. In the meantime, XR empowers HMI in the industrial field. This paper presents an XR application framework for DT-based services within a manufacturing context. This work aims to develop a technological framework to improve the efficiency of the XR application development and the usability of the XR-based HMI systems. We first introduce four layers of the framework, including the perception layer with the physical machine and its ROS-based simulation model, the machine communication layer, the network layer containing three kinds of communication middleware, and the Unity-based service layer creating XR-based digital applications. Subsequently, we conduct the responsiveness test for the framework and describe several XR industrial applications for a DT-based smart crane. Finally, we highlight the research challenges and potential issues that should be further addressed by analyzing the performance of the whole framework.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"FI"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I9927081"},{"type":"ror","value":"020hwjq30"},{"type":"fundref","value":"501100002666"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.5373.2"}],"name":"Aalto University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Chao","initials":"C","last_name":"Yang"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Xinyi","initials":"X","last_name":"Tu"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Juuso","initials":"J","last_name":"Autiosalo"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Riku","initials":"R","last_name":"Ala-Laurinaho"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Joel","initials":"J","last_name":"Mattila"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Pauli","initials":"P","last_name":"Salminen"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Kari","initials":"K","last_name":"Tammi"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-06-14T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"6030","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Industry 4.0"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Context (archaeology)"},{"name":"Digital transformation"},{"name":"Middleware (distributed applications)"},{"name":"Application layer"},{"name":"Manufacturing engineering"},{"name":"Engineering"},{"name":"Systems engineering"}],"funding":[{"country":null,"funding_id":null,"org":"Business Finland"}],"issue":"12","keywords":[],"lens_id":"169-493-279-703-51X","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"001-501-694-057-716"},{"lens_id":"004-085-738-535-206"},{"lens_id":"004-420-242-506-255"},{"lens_id":"005-912-139-679-809"},{"lens_id":"006-892-043-785-704"},{"lens_id":"009-851-433-625-819"},{"lens_id":"013-961-199-230-836"},{"lens_id":"014-206-084-650-088"},{"lens_id":"017-415-713-662-955"},{"lens_id":"019-377-897-064-068"},{"lens_id":"020-250-142-306-281"},{"lens_id":"021-473-871-108-925"},{"lens_id":"024-294-681-700-659"},{"lens_id":"029-369-428-965-288"},{"lens_id":"032-273-512-707-734"},{"lens_id":"035-358-475-696-790"},{"lens_id":"042-139-189-848-822"},{"lens_id":"046-727-219-981-488"},{"lens_id":"048-092-008-205-493"},{"lens_id":"051-794-592-567-825"},{"lens_id":"052-219-484-209-348"},{"lens_id":"056-667-310-722-226"},{"lens_id":"058-724-297-052-90X"},{"lens_id":"059-424-427-267-469"},{"lens_id":"061-458-859-607-380"},{"lens_id":"061-607-719-092-975"},{"lens_id":"064-138-810-036-202"},{"lens_id":"065-186-992-988-265"},{"lens_id":"069-524-132-610-400"},{"lens_id":"071-234-216-800-144"},{"lens_id":"079-725-390-592-069"},{"lens_id":"084-970-472-358-639"},{"lens_id":"085-360-548-865-679"},{"lens_id":"095-096-161-740-778"},{"lens_id":"096-370-400-671-817"},{"lens_id":"104-963-683-392-202"},{"lens_id":"109-202-790-784-741"},{"lens_id":"113-830-545-572-413"},{"lens_id":"113-990-898-518-052"},{"lens_id":"119-628-533-980-603"},{"lens_id":"120-749-568-596-544"},{"lens_id":"169-612-087-067-722"},{"lens_id":"181-383-343-326-198"},{"lens_id":"199-963-221-016-954"}],"scholarly_citations_count":1,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"unknown","value":"20763417"}],"publisher":"MDPI AG","title_full":"Applied Sciences"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"6030","title":"Extended Reality Application Framework for a Digital-Twin-Based Smart Crane","volume":"12","year_published":2022},{"abstract":"Osamu Tezuka is known as a pioneer of modern manga. His works such as Tetsuwan Atom, Black Jack, and Kimba The White Lion have been translated into various languages and have received many prestigious awards in the field of comics. In 1989, Tezuka passed away, leaving a cultural legacy not only for manga but also for the comics world. Phaidon is a manga created under the name of Tezuka and published in 2020. The interesting thing about Paidon is that its creation was done by Artificial Intelligence and staff from Tezuka Pro. This process is relatively new in comics because, generally, comics are made by an artist/group. This research focuses on Paidon as a case study to build a model of how visual idioms are constructed. The method used is the visual analysis by Gillian Rose, which covers aspects of production, image, and audience, where each aspect includes technological, compositional, and social modalities. This study concludes that the preservation of deceased artists required capable human resources to mimic the visual language; the AI took the role of a production apparatus. This might be one production method in the future. However, without the capabilities of human resources, Paidon would not achieve a maximum visual approach.","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"P.","initials":"P","last_name":"Aditia"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"R.P.","initials":"R","last_name":"Bastari"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"L.","initials":"L","last_name":"Agung"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-08-25T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"229","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Comics"},{"name":"Art"},{"name":"Visual

or the rising individualized product needs. A resilient manufacturing strategy based on the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks plays an essential role in facilitating production and supply chain recovery. IIoT contains confidential data and private information, and many security issues arise through vulnerabilities in the infrastructure. The traditional centralized IIoT framework is not only of high cost for system configuration but also vulnerable to cyber-attacks and single-point failure, which is not suitable for achieving the resilient manufacturing vision in Industry 5.0. Recently, researchers are seeking a secure solution of middleware based on blockchain technology integration for decentralized IIoT, which can effectively protect the consistency, integrity, and availability of IIoT data by utilizing the auditing and tamper-proof features of the blockchain. This paper presented a review of secure blockchain middleware for decentralized IIoT towards Industry 5.0. Firstly, the security issues of conventional IIoT solutions and the advantages of blockchain middleware are analyzed. Secondly, an architecture of secure blockchain middleware for decentralized IIoT is proposed. Finally, enabling technologies, challenges, and future directions are reviewed. The innovation of this paper is to study and discuss the distributed blockchain middleware, investigating its ability to eliminate the risk of a single point of failure via a distributed feature in the context of resilient manufacturing in Industry 5.0 and to solve the security issues from traditional centralized IIoT. Also, the four-layer architecture of blockchain middleware presented based on the IIoT application framework is a novel aspect of this review. It is expected that the paper lays a solid foundation for making IIoT blockchain middleware a new venue for Industry 5.0 research.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Jiewu","initials":"J","last_name":"Leng"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Ziying","initials":"Z","last_name":"Chen"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Zhiqiang","initials":"Z","last_name":"Huang"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Xiaofeng","initials":"X","last_name":"Zhu"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Hongye","initials":"H","last_name":"Su"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Zisheng","initials":"Z","last_name":"Lin"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Ding","initials":"D","last_name":"Zhang"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-09-26T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":null,"fields_of_study":[],"funding":[{"country":null,"funding_id":null,"org":"National

Sustainability is getting much attention, leading to the advent of Industry 5.0, which, unlike Industry 4.0, takes sustainable production into account. Forestry sectors are significant for the Portuguese economy, especially cork. This study examines a company in the cork sector to determine how automation and monetization of new resources could increase efficiency, quality, and safety. A qualitative approach was applied in the study through literature review and participant observation actions to analyze and propose improvements. The study fulfilled the purposes defined, identifying options to improve the production process and increase customer satisfaction and worker safety. </jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[],"ids":[],"name":"Institute of Management and Administration of Santarém, Portugal"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Joao P.

The present industrial wave—Industry 4.0—by using its enabling technologies and principles holds great potential to develop sustainable manufacturing paradigms which require balancing out the three fundamental elements —products, processes, and systems. Yet, numerous stakeholders, including industrial policy and decision makers, remain oblivious of such potential and requirements. Thus, this bibliometric study is aimed at presenting an overview of the broad field of research on the convergence of sustainable manufacturing and Industry 4.0 under the umbrella of “Sustainable Manufacturing 4.0”, which has yet to be developed. It includes the dissemination of original findings on pathways and practices of Industry 4.0 applied to the development of sustainable manufacturing, contributing a bibliometric structure of the literature on the aforementioned convergence to reveal how Industry 4.0 could be used to shift the manufacturing sector to a more sustainable-based state. An initial research agenda for this emerging area has accordingly been presented, which may pave the way for having a futuristic view on Sustainable Manufacturing 5.0 in the next industrial wave,

time we start with several papers regarding the new wave of the Digital Era and the ICT Revolution, starting with the general Framework of Global and Remote Communication that represents on the context of an expanding Globalization the way we are opening to a new world with great opportunities, but that also brings some risks like the Moral Challenges of the advanced technologies of the 4th Industrial Revolution, that hopefully may be overcome in the 5th Industrial Revolution with the kind of Society 5.0 that is emerging in Japan. Moreover, advances in the Digital Era may also foster citizenship development as shown in the next paper; but at the same time represent a challenge regarding professional skills needed in particular for startups that are growing rapidly in number and size everywhere; so this is context of the next paper. Next paper is a study on the Quality of Life at work based on Leadership Models that in particular shows the positive impacts of a more Participatory Leadership. Next paper shows, through a survey of 396 companies in Brazil, that only a small number of organizations deal with the process of retaining professionals identified as potential successors that no doubt could be very relevant for the organization. Regarding Human Resources next paper is a study based on a Semantic Analysis about possibilities that are opening already, at the recruitment and selection process, by using Artificial Intelligence. Next paper seeks to find relationships between motivation and engagement and project management by means of a bibliometric analysis. For this purpose, was performed a cluster analysis of 529 articles using VOXviewer indicated that motivation in projects is strongly linked to professional development and growth, with increased interest in sustainability and in the relationship with stakeholders represented by the internal and external community of projects; and regarding Organizational Culture next paper shows, through a survey of 109 Organizations in Brazil, the importance of integrating Cultural Diversity in Organizations that may not only help to improve social conditions but also lead to recruiting better talents and leads to greater customer orientation, greater employee satisfaction and better decision making representing a win-win strategy. Still regarding Organizational Culture, and based on Quinn and Rohrbaugh’s model, next paper focus impacts on Competitive Strategy in the Banking Segment following Quinn and McGrath approach. Next paper is a statistical study regarding Fidelity in the Physical Fitness Business, using Logistic Regression and unidirectional ANOVA, that surprisingly show that frequency of use was the most relevant variable related to customer retention, rather than price and membership length. Today’s economic impacts of COVID-!9 is leading Public Policies in Governments like Brazil to drastically reduce Investments in Science and Technology that may end up decreasing the Human Development Index – HDI, as shown by next paper based on a previous study of the performance indicators in Science, Technology and Innovation CT&amp;I in 14 countries including some like Brazil. Today, 55% of the world's population lives in urban areas, a proportion that is expected to increase to 68% by 2050; as a matter of fact by 2050, two-thirds of all humanity will live in urban areas; and higher changes have actually been in Latin America and the Caribbean with 81.2% of the population already living in urban areas, up from 41.3% in 1950. Hence particularly in these regions sustainable development will become fundamental for the management of cities, so next paper dealing with a small city in southern Brazil may be helping as Best Practice Case. The city was able, through Team Works, to developed a Municipal Goals Plan based on the Sustainable Development Goals - SDG and in less than 4 years (2017-2020) 90% of which were reached through Work Teams driven basically by: The engagement of those responsible for2RISUS – Journal on Innovation and Sustainability, São Paulo, v. 12, n.2, p. 1-3, abr./mai. 2021 - ISSN 2179-3565Administrative Management, The importance of planning, at both strategic and operational levels, and the commitment of the teams in the execution of the actions. Actually, Brazil for some time has being already counting with an Open Sustainable Cities Program that help cities to develop its own strategies accordingly. Next paper is a survey of 48 companies in Brazil that using Crunchbase and Iramuteq technologies found three classes of business blockchain impact on Business models: A distributed value structure, a governance structure and an application structure aimed at encrypted and tokens. Next paper coming from Ukraine shows an approach for modelling a System of Balanced Criteria of Business Process Management (BPM), focused on large data volumes with a basic processes implemented using the cloud computing service — math.semestr, that may be promising in terms of automation of business process management. Last paper comes from Malaysia and deals with a trial on Home Buyers´ Willingness to Pay (WTP), using an on-line survey constructed using the LMA design tool provided in the ‘support.CEs’ package that showed that even a small and diversified sample of 20 respondents dealing with home buyer preferences for sustainable housing and analyzed using the package’s clogit function may give some results even for the measurement of a higher number of variables.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Arnoldo José de Hoyos","initials":"AJDH","last_name":"Guevara"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2021-06-18T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"3","fields_of_study":[],"funding":[],"issue":"2","keywords":[],"lens_id":"179-384-538-745-707","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"21793565"}],"publisher":"Pontifical Catholic University of Sao Paulo (PUC-SP)","title_full":"Journal on Innovation and Sustainability RISUS"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"1","title":"EDITORIAL AND INDEX","volume":"12","year_published":2021},{"abstract":"<jats:p>The industry is a key driver of economic development. However, changes caused by introduction of modern technologies, and increasing complexity of products and production, directly affect the industrial enterprises and workers. The critics of the Industry 4.0 paradigm emphasized its orientation to new technologies and digitalization in a technocratic way. Therefore, the new industrial paradigm Industry 5.0 appeared very soon and automatically triggered a debate about the role of, and reasons for applying, the new paradigm. Industry 5.0 is complementing the existing Industry 4.0 paradigm with the orientation to the worker who has an important role in the production process, and that role has been emphasized during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this research, there is a brief discussion on main drivers and enablers for introduction of these new paradigms, then a literature-based analysis is carried out to highlight the differences between two paradigms from three important aspects—people, organization, and technology. The conclusion emphasizes the main features and concerns regarding the movement towards Industry 5.0, and the general conclusion is that there is a significant change of the main research aims from sustainability towards human-centricity. At the end, the analysis of maturity models that evaluates enterprises’ readiness to introduce features of new paradigms is given as

Individuals, companies, and supply chains face challenges emerging from economic, sociological, and political phenomena. These phenomena disrupt regular performance and limit the efficient functioning of companies and economies. Due to numerous relations and connections in the economy, disruptions in one area affect the others and spread, growing in range and severity. Hence, disruptions should be dealt with to provide continuity of supply chains and to ensure their efficient and effective performance. The study aims to identify crucial characteristics of disruptions to facilitate disruption minimization strategies. The characteristics of disruptions in supply chains are identified based on a literature review, synthesized and validated by the experts. A study is implemented to validate identified characteristics and to confront theoretical findings with the practical experience and observations of the experts. The results of the study are discussed and commented on. The conclusions from the study refer to the nature and characteristics of disruptions in the contemporary economy, equipping managers with useful knowledge when dealing with disruptions, and academics with observations that can stimulate further discussion on stability, flexibility, and resilience of companies and supply chains.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"PL"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I46597724"},{"type":"ror","value":"00p7p3302"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.6963.a"}],"name":"Poznań University of Technology"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Katarzyna","initials":"K","last_name":"Grzybowska"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Agnieszka","initials":"A","last_name":"Stachowiak"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-06-23T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"4579","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Supply chain"},{"name":"Flexibility (engineering)"},{"name":"Resilience (materials science)"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Psychological resilience"},{"name":"Geopolitics"},{"name":"Industrial organization"},{"name":"Emerging markets"},{"name":"Risk analysis (engineering)"},{"name":"Economic system"}],"funding":[{"country":null,"funding_id":null,"org":"Poznań University of Technology"}],"issue":"13","keywords":[],"lens_id":"189-681-888-120-997","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"002-808-413-983-549"},{"lens_id":"003-837-661-819-384"},{"lens_id":"005-929-467-959-843"},{"lens_id":"007-022-995-409-922"},{"lens_id":"010-239-201-980-736"},{"lens_id":"011-256-657-003-280"},{"lens_id":"016-205-652-115-031"},{"lens_id":"019-762-945-371-929"},{"lens_id":"022-724-590-714-654"},{"lens_id":"026-537-026-083-013"},{"lens_id":"037-830-455-620-78X"},{"lens_id":"037-945-118-531-575"},{"lens_id":"038-646-774-263-958"},{"lens_id":"041-290-978-117-294"},{"lens_id":"042-235-824-984-197"},{"lens_id":"053-915-729-491-288"},{"lens_id":"055-288-223-917-15X"},{"lens_id":"058-905-175-880-988"},{"lens_id":"070-328-959-620-604"},{"lens_id":"085-267-822-728-575"},{"lens_id":"085-531-697-099-430"},{"lens_id":"088-618-199-729-410"},{"lens_id":"098-531-705-893-880"},{"lens_id":"100-124-216-391-558"},{"lens_id":"114-219-695-582-035"},{"lens_id":"123-096-849-447-602"},{"lens_id":"131-527-044-332-48X"},{"lens_id":"137-422-360-565-821"},{"lens_id":"141-331-639-170-377"},{"lens_id":"168-374-894-057-574"}],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":"Switzerland","issn":[{"type":"print","value":"19961073"}],"publisher":"MDPI AG","title_full":"Energies"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"4579","title":"Global Changes and Disruptions in Supply Chains—Preliminary Research to Sustainable Resilience of Supply Chains","volume":"15","year_published":2022},{"abstract":"Referring to previous research, the use of natural fiber materials can increase consumer interest while answering the need of people who apply the “Back to Nature” lifestyle especially in home living.

Although the notion of DX has garnered much research interest from practitioners, scholarship on this topic is somehow lagging behind, possibly because of the lack of theoretical frameworks on DX. Recently, most Japanese firms have begun to use diverse digital technologies to sustain their competitive advantages. However, the return of investment on digital technologies has not been as high as expected for some firms. Furthermore, as the visions of Industry 5.0 describe sustainable, resilient, and human-centered future factories that will require smart and resilient capabilities both from next-generation manufacturing systems and human operators, it is necessary to design resilient human–machine collaborations within factories. To this end, this paper presents a research model between DX technologies and scientific problem-solving in terms of deduction, induction, and abduction inference structures as an approach to resilient human–machine collaborations. The purpose of this research is to analyze the difference in the utilization pattern of the digital technology of American, German, and Japanese firms based on three types of decision-making methods. Next, we apply this framework in a comparative case study of two Japanese firms and one German firm, where we find that there is a difference in DX technologies utilization among the Japanese and German firms. We assert that the utilization of IoT technology in the United States and Germany is pursuing IoT with the aim of autonomous control, whereas Japanese firms prioritize robot–human collaboration. Finally, we discuss how our findings contribute to the burgeoning field of resilient human–machine collaborations by showing the distinct roles of deduction, induction, and abduction inference structures. Furthermore, our research contributes to international comparative studies to identify the difference in national IT utilization. Lessons and implications are discussed.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"JP"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I72253084"},{"type":"ror","value":"02evnh647"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.263023.6"}],"name":"Saitama University"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Young Won","initials":"YW","last_name":"Park"},{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Junjiro","initials":"J","last_name":"Shintaku"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-08-25T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"10583","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Lagging"},{"name":"Digital transformation"},{"name":"German"},{"name":"Pace"},{"name":"Industrial organization"},{"name":"Vision"},{"name":"Industry 4.0"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Computer science"},{"name":"Marketing"}],"funding":[],"issue":"17","keywords":[],"lens_id":"192-397-051-503-54X","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"002-085-045-445-344"},{"lens_id":"003-399-150-768-506"},{"lens_id":"006-947-132-272-228"},{"lens_id":"007-157-342-877-831"},{"lens_id":"009-851-433-625-819"},{"lens_id":"012-218-887-216-344"},{"lens_id":"022-613-542-030-336"},{"lens_id":"023-790-190-496-186"},{"lens_id":"025-838-880-494-316"},{"lens_id":"031-235-778-832-782"},{"lens_id":"036-555-670-584-005"},{"lens_id":"041-406-317-756-787"},{"lens_id":"053-089-404-364-449"},{"lens_id":"056-485-524-375-867"},{"lens_id":"061-012-983-689-452"},{"lens_id":"063-390-375-334-464"},{"lens_id":"067-050-661-116-219"},{"lens_id":"068-833-488-459-388"},{"lens_id":"081-596-379-437-686"},{"lens_id":"087-501-199-643-670"},{"lens_id":"088-321-242-569-049"},{"lens_id":"102-113-825-126-978"},{"lens_id":"102-226-089-425-46X"},{"lens_id":"115-232-897-230-33X"},{"lens_id":"143-724-850-069-880"},{"lens_id":"146-473-356-444-943"},{"lens_id":"148-879-759-455-156"},{"lens_id":"157-213-706-957-756"},{"lens_id":"171-092-306-725-218"}],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":"Switzerland","issn":[{"type":"print","value":"20711050"}],"publisher":"MDPI AG","title_full":"Sustainability"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"10583","title":"Sustainable Human–Machine Collaborations in Digital Transformation Technologies Adoption: A Comparative Case Study of Japan and Germany","volume":"14","year_published":2022},{"abstract":"Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is the concrete practice of sustainable development at the enterprise level, emphasizing the human value in the production process.

Therefore, this paper studies the optimization of medical enterprise’s operations management considering enterprise CSR under Industry 5.0. A mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is developed to maximize the CSR with the consideration of the impact of precision medical technologies such as surgical robots (SRs) and 3D bone printing on employee social welfare, corporate profits, social environment, and customer surplus value. An improved variable neighborhood tabu search (IVNTS) algorithm which combines the variable neighborhood tabu search (VNTS) algorithm and simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is designed to solve the model, and numerical experiments are analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed IVNTS.

Currently, there is a need to consider sustainable development and the crucial role of man in the assumptions of industry’s future development. Concerns about the implementation of the fourth industrial revolution’s technology became the basis for building the assumptions of Industry 5.0. The article aims to identify the social and economic expectations of the development of the fourth industrial revolution in the context of the development of the sustainability, humanization, and resilience of Industry 4.0. The article presents the results of research obtained based on a critical analysis of the literature and surveys conducted among representatives of Polish society. As a result of the research, key social expectations as to the directions of development of the Industry 4.0 concept were identified. Recommendations for industry development focused on three areas of development—human-centric, sustainable, and resilient—were established. The presented research results will allow the development of an investment strategy and a government policy to support the development of industry based on the human-centric digitization of the economy.</jats:p>","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"PL"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I46305939"},{"type":"ror","value":"04fzm7v55"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.28048.36"}],"name":"University of Zielona Góra"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Sebastian","initials":"S","last_name":"Saniuk"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"PL"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I119004910"},{"type":"ror","value":"02dyjk442"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.6979.1"}],"name":"Silesian University of Technology"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Sandra","initials":"S","last_name":"Grabowska"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"SK"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I183764125"},{"type":"ror","value":"05xm08015"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.6903.c"}],"name":"Technical University of Košice"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Martin","initials":"M","last_name":"Straka"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-01-26T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"1391","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Industrial Revolution"},{"name":"Government (linguistics)"},{"name":"Sustainable development"},{"name":"Industry 4.0"},{"name":"Context (archaeology)"},{"name":"Digitization"},{"name":"Sustainability"},{"name":"Process (computing)"},{"name":"Prosperity"},{"name":"Dehumanization"},{"name":"Identification (biology)"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Economics"},{"name":"Economic growth"},{"name":"Economic system"}],"funding":[],"issue":"3","keywords":[],"lens_id":"195-220-031-879-975","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"journal article","references":[{"lens_id":"002-995-208-654-267"},{"lens_id":"007-592-719-575-515"},{"lens_id":"011-575-011-664-790"},{"lens_id":"013-287-665-466-861"},{"lens_id":"013-833-776-008-172"},{"lens_id":"015-008-734-610-504"},{"lens_id":"015-499-462-446-614"},{"lens_id":"016-819-194-616-838"},{"lens_id":"017-415-713-662-955"},{"lens_id":"017-640-020-815-147"},{"lens_id":"020-924-235-588-204"},{"lens_id":"024-047-654-726-820"},{"lens_id":"025-131-859-546-629"},{"lens_id":"025-253-322-092-116"},{"lens_id":"028-232-581-949-707"},{"lens_id":"028-321-099-284-473"},{"lens_id":"029-434-241-679-095"},{"lens_id":"033-541-372-628-755"},{"lens_id":"036-175-603-962-622"},{"lens_id":"036-652-321-315-178"},{"lens_id":"038-964-429-089-518"},{"lens_id":"039-246-626-911-312"},{"lens_id":"040-252-352-426-753"},{"lens_id":"048-038-873-341-337"},{"lens_id":"048-872-880-871-621"},{"lens_id":"049-816-999-056-296"},{"lens_id":"051-719-689-499-873"},{"lens_id":"052-471-621-847-448"},{"lens_id":"052-603-569-095-390"},{"lens_id":"057-670-948-885-722"},{"lens_id":"059-768-273-435-982"},{"lens_id":"060-352-821-341-634"},{"lens_id":"063-312-615-700-918"},{"lens_id":"063-835-629-463-485"},{"lens_id":"067-036-276-850-854"},{"lens_id":"071-473-279-124-057"},{"lens_id":"071-666-089-865-306"},{"lens_id":"072-236-779-686-90X"},{"lens_id":"072-974-520-873-188"},{"lens_id":"075-662-363-625-645"},{"lens_id":"076-248-573-094-89X"},{"lens_id":"076-303-271-715-610"},{"lens_id":"078-407-023-029-477"},{"lens_id":"078-963-554-027-275"},{"lens_id":"079-725-390-592-069"},{"lens_id":"080-323-040-873-403"},{"lens_id":"081-483-272-003-684"},{"lens_id":"096-577-069-851-321"},{"lens_id":"097-238-534-260-747"},{"lens_id":"102-424-326-687-39X"},{"lens_id":"102-861-736-374-631"},{"lens_id":"113-830-545-572-413"},{"lens_id":"122-389-536-558-056"},{"lens_id":"125-795-343-058-314"},{"lens_id":"126-014-294-266-089"},{"lens_id":"127-021-195-266-886"},{"lens_id":"132-434-066-780-80X"},{"lens_id":"138-332-915-687-580"},{"lens_id":"146-118-783-422-427"},{"lens_id":"152-593-264-986-247"},{"lens_id":"169-380-214-360-631"}],"scholarly_citations_count":6,"source":{"country":"Switzerland","issn":[{"type":"print","value":"20711050"}],"publisher":"MDPI AG","title_full":"Sustainability"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"1391","title":"Identification of Social and Economic Expectations: Contextual Reasons for the Transformation Process of Industry 4.0 into the Industry 5.0 Concept","volume":"14","year_published":2022},{"abstract":"Every culture in the world passes down stories from generation to generation. These stories shape society and serve as moral guides. Unfortunately, with the rise of modern pop culture, the younger generations are no longer familiar with their cultural heritage. The latest developments in the creative industry show a rise in trends to adapt local culture into famous creative works with economic value. In light of the trend, the Visual Communication Design Department of Universitas Ciputra Surabaya and Da Yeh University Taiwan (Taiwan, ROC) created “Folktales of Indonesia and Taiwan”. This research will use the said book to determine whether illustrations are practical for cross-cultural storytelling. Qualitative data were collected from book users in both countries; the data was then compared with results from the literature study. The result shows that illustrations are effective as cross-cultural storytelling media as long as these are created based on extensive research of the source materials.","authors":[{"affiliations":[],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Shienny M.","initials":"SM","last_name":"Sutanto"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-08-25T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"115","fields_of_study":[],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"195-426-206-557-622","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"book chapter","references":[],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[],"publisher":"Routledge","title_full":"Embracing the Future: Creative Industries for Environment and Advanced Society 5.0 in a Post-Pandemic Era"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"111","title":"Illustration as cross-cultural storytelling media: Case study on \"Folktales of Indonesia and Taiwan\" book","volume":null,"year_published":2022},{"abstract":"AbstractInnovation has led to the rapid development of the manufacturing industry. The future directions of the manufacturing industry will highlight new competencies that employees will have to have and requirements that companies will have to have. The evaluation of these directions and the proposal of some organizational strategies represent necessary elements for the industry, experts and those who want to get started in the production activity. This chapter evaluates the implications of Industry 4.0 and makes an inventory of the technologies used in this industrial era. To consolidate the importance of this revolution for the manufacturing industry, a presentation of the situation in Romania is made from the perspective of various important indicators for Industry 4.0. At the end of the chapter is presented a market research and the strategic roadmap for the future of manufacturing. The case study highlights the fact that companies have a major interest in automation and digitization, but there are also several barriers that must be overcome. These barriers can be overcome with the help of facilitators that are presented at the end of the chapter.KeywordsInnovationIndustry 4.0Industry 5.0ProductionManufacturing industryCompetitiveness","authors":[{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"RO"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I3122695212"},{"type":"ror","value":"02v91gy68"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.6992.4"}],"name":"Polytechnic University of Timişoara"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Florin","initials":"F","last_name":"Dragan"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"RO"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I33800924"},{"type":"ror","value":"04ybnj478"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.435118.a"}],"name":"Academy of Romanian Scientists"},{"addresses":[{"country_code":"RO"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I3122695212"},{"type":"ror","value":"02v91gy68"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.6992.4"}],"name":"Polytechnic University of Timişoara"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Larisa","initials":"L","last_name":"Ivascu"},{"affiliations":[{"addresses":[{"country_code":"RO"}],"ids":[{"type":"openalex","value":"I141595442"},{"type":"ror","value":"02x2v6p15"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.5100.4"}],"name":"University of Bucharest"}],"collective_name":null,"first_name":"Ben-Oni","initials":"B","last_name":"Ardelean"}],"chemicals":[],"date_published":{"date":"2022-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"},"end_page":"292","fields_of_study":[{"name":"Digitization"},{"name":"Industry 4.0"},{"name":"Manufacturing"},{"name":"Business"},{"name":"Technology roadmap"},{"name":"Automation"},{"name":"Presentation (obstetrics)"},{"name":"Engineering"},{"name":"Process management"},{"name":"Industrial organization"},{"name":"Engineering management"},{"name":"Manufacturing engineering"}],"funding":[],"issue":null,"keywords":[],"lens_id":"197-781-539-001-365","mesh_terms":[],"patent_citations_count":0,"publication_type":"book chapter","references":[{"lens_id":"001-326-619-499-770"},{"lens_id":"005-630-554-308-831"},{"lens_id":"008-271-422-618-915"},{"lens_id":"010-987-924-507-516"},{"lens_id":"012-876-383-866-559"},{"lens_id":"014-253-688-185-713"},{"lens_id":"015-335-708-327-244"},{"lens_id":"025-045-066-659-075"},{"lens_id":"026-467-059-357-593"},{"lens_id":"027-519-650-344-683"},{"lens_id":"031-827-047-258-990"},{"lens_id":"033-851-018-944-660"},{"lens_id":"036-652-321-315-178"},{"lens_id":"038-904-037-813-023"},{"lens_id":"041-950-002-747-236"},{"lens_id":"045-936-475-493-242"},{"lens_id":"048-038-873-341-337"},{"lens_id":"054-244-545-950-971"},{"lens_id":"058-743-340-991-157"},{"lens_id":"059-178-760-820-941"},{"lens_id":"064-020-389-152-31X"},{"lens_id":"067-719-273-356-597"},{"lens_id":"068-636-239-301-800"},{"lens_id":"073-304-876-714-640"},{"lens_id":"074-895-567-621-479"},{"lens_id":"081-144-427-432-971"},{"lens_id":"082-140-051-993-161"},{"lens_id":"084-249-962-919-116"},{"lens_id":"088-034-655-032-109"},{"lens_id":"090-218-470-242-562"},{"lens_id":"090-888-301-148-64X"},{"lens_id":"092-513-140-768-531"},{"lens_id":"097-930-997-344-059"},{"lens_id":"100-124-216-391-558"},{"lens_id":"101-950-684-103-159"},{"lens_id":"104-871-883-983-906"},{"lens_id":"113-830-545-572-413"},{"lens_id":"115-709-456-822-925"},{"lens_id":"123-365-319-409-994"},{"lens_id":"143-129-584-574-414"},{"lens_id":"151-908-391-485-055"},{"lens_id":"154-712-802-855-618"},{"lens_id":"156-303-173-263-817"}],"scholarly_citations_count":0,"source":{"country":null,"issn":[{"type":"unknown","value":"26626829"},{"type":"unknown","value":"26626837"}],"publisher":"Springer Singapore","title_full":"Advances in Sustainability Science and Technology"},"source_urls":[],"start_page":"275","title":"Trends for Manufacturing Industry: A Strategic Roadmap Toward Industry 5.0","volume":null,"year_published":2022}]
