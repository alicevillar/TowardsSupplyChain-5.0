abstract={Because of changing market requirements and uncommonly fast development of computerization, automation and robotization the paradigms concerning methods and techniques of manufacturing are still evaluating to make production processes more and more flexible and effective. The paper presents the issue of the importance of personalized production in the perspective of contemporary customer requirements (including personalization of available products) and technological solutions that fit into the trends of modern industrial revolutions. In particular, the article focuses on the conditions and methods of organizing the work in a modular approach with the use of solutions that are key features of Industry 4.0 and 5.0, so that they effectively carry out production orders formulated as part of individual customer orders, thus implementing mass production. As an example illustrating the issue at hand, the model of production of personalized doors and windows in a production plant belonging to a company from the SME sector was presented. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The term Industry 4.0, coined to be the fourth industrial revolution, refers to a higher level of automation for operational productivity and efficiency by connecting virtual and physical worlds in an industry. With Industry 4.0 being unable to address and meet increased drive of personalization, the term Industry 5.0 was coined for addressing personalized manufacturing and empowering humans in manufacturing processes. The onset of the term Industry 5.0 is observed to have various views of how it is defined and what constitutes the reconciliation between humans and machines. This serves as the motivation of this paper in identifying and analyzing the various themes and research trends of what Industry 5.0 is using text mining tools and techniques. Toward this, the abstracts of 196 published papers based on the keyword “Industry 5.0” search in IEEE, science direct and MDPI data bases were extracted. Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed for further analysis to apply text mining techniques of key terms extraction and frequency analysis. Further topic mining i.e., unsupervised machine learning method was used for exploring the data. It is observed that the terms artificial intelligence (AI), big data, supply chain, digital transformation, machine learning, internet of things (IoT), are among the most often used and among several enablers that have been identified by researchers to drive Industry 5.0. Five major themes of Industry 5.0 addressing, supply chain evaluation and optimization, enterprise innovation and digitization, smart and sustainable manufacturing, transformation driven by IoT, AI, and Big Data, and Human-machine connectivity were classified among the published literature, highlighting the research themes that can be further explored. It is observed that the theme of Industry 5.0 as a gateway towards human machine connectivity and co-existence is gaining more interest among the research community in the recent years. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Industry 4.0 is about smart production, IoT, sensors and drones. Industry 5.0 will be about connecting smart production to human cognition, collaboration and creativity. To this end, progress will be judged on not just the connection of data between the Internet of Things (IoT), but how that connectivity enhances the human experience and shortens the time to achieve environmental safety competencies. This paper discusses how companies such as Shell are deploying more personalized worker experiences to serve the new industrial agenda of achieving the goals of both, the enterprise as well as continually ensure the welfare of humans. Specifically, the paper discusses how: Experiential simulation-based learning strategies such as Operator Training Simulators have become more mobile, on-demand and collaborative in order to drive more personalized worker experiences AI infused microlearning tailored to industrial operations staff is used to build upon an individual's learning profile, identify strengths and weaknesses and provide timely reinforcement learning content Virtual Reality platforms can be used to address behavioral needs, where frontline staff can be trained and evaluated on decision-making and real-time choices when faced with unexpected or infrequent situations in the simulated plant. Using real-life scenarios, these solutions can help instill responsible behavior and boost safety performance across both assets and teams Microsoft Power Apps now allow citizen development of solutions by those closest to the opportunity. The age of mass personalization within an Industry 5.0 world is here and will undoubtedly seeks to achieve large-scale impact, one individual at a time. © 2021 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

abstract={Industry 5.0, the fifth industrial revolution, consists of smart digital information and manufacturing technologies. This industrial revolution generates effective processes and makes rapid improvement in industries and healthcare. Solutions to challenges posed by COVID-19 pandemic can be identified with the deployment of Industry 5.0-based technologies. It helps to provide personalized therapy and treatment processes to the COVID-19 patients if a detailed patient's information is available. The aim of Industry 5.0 technologies is to create a smart healthcare environment with real-time capabilities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, these technologies can provide a remote monitoring system in healthcare. This paper identifies and studies major technologies of Industry 5.0 helpful for the COVID-19 pandemic. The supportive features of Industry 5.0 for the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed diagrammatically. Finally, we identified and studied significant challenges faced in the context of Industry 5.0 technologies for the COVID-19 pandemic. The literature revealed that this technological innovation allows a high personalization level to fulfill personal specific demands of the patient and doctors. These technologies play a significant role in making the life of doctors better. Further, doctors can use this technology to focus on critically infected patients and provide proper appropriate information regarding their better treatment. Moreover, Industry 5.0 technologies can help doctors and medical students for required medical training during this COVID-19 outbreak. © World Scientific Publishing Co.},

abstract={Rapid advances in sophisticated technologies, especially those engaging robots have always mesmerized mankind, driving consistent quality and flow in manufacturing processes. The focus has been on eliminating or at least reducing the dull, dangerous, and dirty jobs for human workforce. The industry seems to continuously reincarnate from mass production and customized production into mass personalization objectives to fulfil customer responsiveness while also achieving cost efficiencies, a concept that explains an industrial revolution involving the human touch to be christened as Industry 5.0. The concept even though still visionary yet a realistic one includes Collaboration of human and artificial intelligence with IOT enabled devices. Fifth revolution restricted the advantages cultivated from fourth revolution and it brings humans back into the picture. Fifth industrial revolution demands high skilled people and robots working together to create personalized products, services and experiences. The purpose of this paper is to implement a systematic study of Industry 5.0 to construct an overview of its core dimensions, identifying key constructs that inter-relate to achieve the objective of integrating human touch with technology. The study also lists out the key focus area involved in its implementation and also describes the approach of human computer collaboration. Fifth revolution still is in its initial stage but companies are trying to act sooner upon it causes they wants to be ahead from their competitors. Consequently, the knowledge emerging from the review of the Industry 5.0 is further synthesized for delineating further research agenda. © BEIESP.},
