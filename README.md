## 1. Overview 
 <br> 
 We conducted a dynamic literature review method called Systematic Literature Network Analysis (SLNA), which combines a bibliographic analysis with a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Through this mixed approach, this study examines the research landscape of Industry 5.0 Supply Chains by conducting a bibliometric analysis of 682 documents published from 2016 to 2022. We utilized VOSViewer and Bibliometrix software to construct and visualize bibliometric networks using publications taken from three databases: Dimensions, SCOPUS, and Lens.

## 2. Tools 

* [**Bibliometix**](https://www.bibliometrix.org/home/) - used for multiple bibliometric analyses.
* [**VOSviewer**](https://www.vosviewer.com/) - used for constructing and visualizing bibliometric networks.
* [**Dimensions**](https://app.dimensions.ai) - used to collect academic documents. 
* [**Lens**](https://www.lens.org/) - used to collect academic documents. 
* [**Scopus**](https://www.scopus.com/) - used to collect academic documents.
