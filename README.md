## 1. Overview 
 <br> 
 This article performs a bibliometric study followed by a systematic literature review to analyze the published literature landscape and presents a study of how Industry 5.0 can enable supply chain evaluation and optimization in manufacturing processes, helping to enhance supply chain resilience. Through this mixed approach, which incorporates both qualitative and quantitative methods, this paper analyzes the novel concept of Supply Chain 5.0, identifying its fundamental constructs and ongoing trends. In addition, we propose a conceptual framework to understand and model Supply Chain 5.0 as sustainable, resilient, and human-centric. Our findings can benefit and empower both research and practice. While practitioners can use the results to guide investment decisions, scholars may use them to better understand how Industry 5.0 can help redesign future supply chains.

## 2. Research Questions  
 <br> 
As a guiding framework for our research, we answer the following research questions (RQs):  
   
> * RQ1- What does the fifth industrial revolution mean in the supply chain context? 
> *	RQ2 â€“ What are the major topics and associated literature related to the pillars of Supply Chain 5.0?
> *	RQ3 - What would a Supply Chain 5.0 conceptual framework look like?
> *	RQ4 - What is the future research agenda related to Supply Chain 5.0? 


## 3. Methodology  


## 3.1 Bibliometric Research and SLR

This study employed the use of VOS Viewer, a software tool for constructing and visualizing bibliometric networks. VOS Viewer interface allows for loading and exporting information from many sources. We obtained papers from three databases: Dimensions, SCOPUS, and Web of Science. 

With VOSviewer, we could display bibliometric network mappings to visualize important articles, leading authors and countries, influential journals, current research topics, and hot trends in the field. We performed the following bibliometric research methods:

 
:arrow_forward: 1. Document co-citation analysis: to find the most important articles with a high citation frequency in the crowdsourcing research field. 
<br>
:arrow_forward: 2. Journal co-citation analysis: to find which journals are dominant sources of articles regarding crowdsourcing. 
:arrow_forward: 3. Co-authorship analysis: to find the important and influential authors, institutions, and countries.  
:arrow_forward: 4. Co-occurrence word analysis: to measure the frequency of keywords and identify current research front and evolving trends.  


Through the document co-citation analysis, we identified the top 15 most cited articles in the crowdsourcing research field to analyze. We conducted our systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) methodology to ensure a transparent, accurate, replicable, and scientifically adequate systematic review. (Page et al., 2021) Accordingly, a protocol was established to define a Search Strategy Methodology to define the data sources, selection criteria, data extraction, and analysis.  

## 3.2 Search Strategy Methodology
