## 1. Overview 
 <br> 
This study, which is based on secondary data, employed the Systematic Literature Network Analysis (SLNA) method, combining bibliographic analysis and Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to investigate the research landscape of Industry 5.0 Supply Chains. The analysis involved 682 documents published between 2016 and 2022 and utilized VOSViewer and Bibliometrix software for multiple bibliometric analyses, drawing on publications from Dimensions, SCOPUS, and Lens databases. 
<br>  

## 2. Tools 

* [**Bibliometix**](https://www.bibliometrix.org/home/) - used for multiple bibliometric analyses.
* [**VOSviewer**](https://www.vosviewer.com/) - used for constructing and visualizing bibliometric networks.
* [**Dimensions**](https://app.dimensions.ai) - used to collect academic documents. 
* [**Lens**](https://www.lens.org/) - used to collect academic documents. 
* [**Scopus**](https://www.scopus.com/) - used to collect academic documents. 

 
## 3. VOSViewer 

In order to understand the impacts of Industry 5.0 on supply chains, we conducted a bibliometric KCN analysis using VOSviewer software to identify clusters associated with Supply Chain 5.0 (Search 1) and its three major pillars: resilience (Search 2), sustainability (Search 3), and human-centricity (Search 4). 

### Search 1 - 5IR Supply Chains
  
A keyword had to occur at least 32 times. These value was chosen to make the number of words that meet the threshold below 200. 

* [Search 1 - Clusters](https://github.com/alicevillar/TowardsSupplyChain-5.0/blob/main/Useful%20docs/VosViewer-Clusters-keywords/VosViewer-Cluster-S1.pdf) 
* Deleted words: science, form, author, account, scenario, world, practice, importance, vision, jat, source, end, hand, way, review, literature, case study, study, type, place, issue. 

### Search 2 - 5IR Supply Chains and Resilience 

* [Search 2 - Clusters](https://github.com/alicevillar/TowardsSupplyChain-5.0/blob/main/Useful%20docs/VosViewer-Clusters-keywords/VosViewer-Cluster-S2.pdf) 
* Deleted words: apms, support, volume, tag, japan, lesson, scenario, fact, nature, focus, firm, expert, addition, vision, evaluation, number, solution, set, term, systematic literature review, term, literature, contribution, foundation, research, country, basis, area, gap, 


### Search 3 - 5IR Supply Chains and Sustainability 

* [Search 3 - Clusters](https://github.com/alicevillar/TowardsSupplyChain-5.0/blob/main/Useful%20docs/VosViewer-Clusters-keywords/VosViewer-Cluster-S3.pdf) 
* Deleted words: attention, author, basis, case, characteristic, contribution, country, direction, end, expert, fact, form, impact, implication, importance, indonesia, issue, japan, jat, lack, limitation, literature, literature review, nature, number, part, place, practice, review, scenario, science, study, support, type, view, world, year.

### Search 4 - 5IR Supply Chains and Human Centricity  

* [Search 4 - Clusters](https://github.com/alicevillar/TowardsSupplyChain-5.0/blob/main/Useful%20docs/VosViewer-Clusters-keywords/VosViewer-Cluster-S4.pdf) 
* Deleted words: outlook, country, support, author, countribution, japan, world, review, form, researcher, field, view, limitation, jat, survey, literature, scenario, set, basis, year, case, context, lack.

## 4. Bibliometrix 

We utilized Bibliometrix to conduct a bibliometric analysis of the research landscape of Industry 5.0 Supply Chains. To visualize the data, we generated seven bibliometric graphs and maps using the Bibliometrix tool in R software. These include:

* Annual Evolution of Scientific Production and main information about data 
* Most Local Cited Sources (from Reference List) 
* Most globally cited documents   
* Wordcloud 
* Word Frequency 
* Trending Topics 
* Thematic Evolution
